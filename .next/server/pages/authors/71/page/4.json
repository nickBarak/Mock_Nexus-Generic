She’s such a great ball handler. There were a couple times we gambled in the backcourt, and she made us pay by attacking and getting to the rim.”</p>\n<p>After UCSB regained the lead, taking a slight 55-52 advantage, Miles converted a layup in transition and earned the foul, completing the three-point play to tie the game with 3:27 remaining.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, Miles drove into the lane and dished the ball to junior forward Kathleen Iwuoha for the layup, giving the Titans a three-point lead.</p>\n<p>Finally, after Santa Barbara missed a jumper to bring the game within one with 24 seconds to go, Miles was fouled and hit the two clutch free throws to ice the game. She finished the afternoon with 11 points and eight assists.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, it’s hard to guard a great player like that one-on-one,” Mitchell said. “That’s not what our defense revolves around, so it was probably the rotation in why she was able to attack and get a couple and-ones.”</p>\n<p>After winning 40 consecutive games against the Titans, UCSB has now dropped the last two. Saturday’s win in the Thunderdome marks the first win in Santa Barbara for Fullerton since 1991 as the Titans improve to 7-11 overall and 3-2 in the Big West. The Gauchos drop to 6-12 overall and 1-4 in conference.</p>\n<p>Once again, UCSB struggled with consistency. After holding the Titans to 23 first half points and 29.2 percent shooting from the field, the Gauchos allowed Fullerton 44 second half points.</p>\n<p>“It’s disappointing because that first half was the style of play we’ve been waiting on the defensive side of things,” Mitchell said. “The game of basketball is two halves, and they made us pay for all of our mistakes in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Five players finished in double-figures for the Titans, and the team hit an incredible 10 shots from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“When you’re making threes and everybody’s feeling it, you get in a certain type of rhythm,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “It gathers momentum for the team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also featured three players in double-figures with senior guard Melissa Zornig leading the Gaucho offense with 20 points. Mason added 18 points and a team-high eight rebounds while Onome Jemerigbe added a career-high 11 points.</p>\n<p>The loss concludes a three-game homestand for Santa Barbara. Next week, the Gauchos go on road, facing UC Irvine and UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January27, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53705\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53705\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/","id":552,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[551,550,549],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn First Conference Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB defeats UC Riverside 74-61 at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It may be early in the season, but the UCSB women’s basketball team could not afford another loss.</p>\n<p>Going into last night’s game against UC Riverside, the Gauchos were 0-3 in the Big West and had lost eight of their last nine.

Riverside, on the other hand, remains the lone winless team in league at 0-5 and 4-14 overall.</p>\n<p>After struggling to start league, averaging just 9.3 points in Santa Barbara’s first three league matches compared to 18.2 points per game during the preseason, senior guard Nicole Nesbit returned to her typical offensive force. She led Santa Barbara with 20 points, six rebounds and four assists with eight of her points coming during a game-deciding 12-0 run for the Gauchos in the second half.</p>\n<p>Zornig also stepped up for UCSB, tallying 16 points, including eight straight points for the Gauchos down the stretch to seal the game.</p>\n<p>However, unlike most games, the Gauchos received offensive production from more than just its seniors. Jasmine ware added 12 points and 11 rebounds, her first career double-double, while junior center Clair Watkins and freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe added eight and seven points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“I’d say it’s about time,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said of Ware’s effort. “I understand the expectations when Jasmine came in here were the same as Clair; everyone thinks it’s supposed to be instant and sometimes it’s a process for kids. We always knew. Jas has great athletic ability and a knack for rebounding. Tonight she stepped up.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outrebounded Riverside 55-30, including 21-6 on the offensive boards, which led to 23 second-chance points. The Gauchos also outscored the Highlanders 34-6 in the paint.</p>\n<p>“In practice we constantly go over rebounding drills over and over, so I think just taking the drills that we do in practice and moving it to the game is what it’s about,” Ware said.</p>\n<p>After missing a multitude of easy layups throughout the first half, Santa Barbara found its offensive stride in the second half. Down 51-50 with just over 17 minutes remaining, Nesbit completed a three point play to spark a 12-0 run for UCSB. Nesbit earned two three point plays during the spurt.</p>\n<p>“Nic’s a gamer and she knows she’s going to get most team’s best defender on her most nights, but she has the ability to score in multiple ways and she found her legs tonight,” Mitchell said. “Her teammates have confidence in her as well as the coaching staff.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Riverside crept back into the game, going on a 6-0 run to decrease the margin to just five points. For the Gauchos, another senior responded, with Zornig dropping eight straight points to keep the Highlanders at bay and seal the victory.</p>\n<p>For Riverside, Brittany Crain continued her offensive dominance in the Big West, scoring 19 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB will finish its three game homestand tomorrow when it hosts Cal State Fullerton.

\r\n</script> \n<p>The team has lost eight of its last nine, with its last victory dating back to almost a month ago when UCSB defeated Seattle Dec. 28.</p>\n<p>“I think we all know our potential, so it’s frustrating, but at the same time, we’re staying positive,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “There’s still a lot of season left. As long as we all stay positive and stay on the same page, I think we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>One of two teams still winless in conference, the Gauchos need to make a run quickly in the ultra-competitive Big West this year.</p>\n<p>The other team still chasing its first conference victory is Riverside. The Highlanders are also extremely hungry for a victory having lost 10 consecutive games. They enter the Thunderdome with a 4-13 overall and a 0-4 Big West mark.</p>\n<p>“We’re both backed in the corner as far as our record and Big West standings,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “There’s no panic, but there is a sense of urgency. We just need to take care of business at home the next two games, and we’ll be at the same record we started out at this point last year. We know what to do. It’s just a matter of buckling down and getting it done.”</p>\n<p>One fatal flaw for UCSB in Big West contests so far has been falling behind by large margins and needing to play catch up late in the game.</p>\n<p>“There’s no reason for us to dig ourselves holes like that,” Mitchell said. “This team is a little uncomfortable with who to go to and through when we need a basket, so everyone puts themselves on an island and tries to do it on their own. You can never do that. It takes five players on the court, so they need to learn to trust each other.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos’ offense is plenty capable of scoring, ranking first in the Big West in field-goal percentage the majority of the year, Santa Barbara knows that defense is what wins it games and that they must return to their defensive prowess from previous years. Right now, UCSB ranks fifth in scoring defense, giving up 70.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Opening up conference, we knew we had to write it across our chest as being a defensive team first,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “That will lead to offense and transition baskets, but it has to start with defense. We know that.”</p>\n<p>Commanding the attention of any defense in the conference is sophomore guard Brittany Crain. Crain leads the Hinglanders in virtually every category, but also tops the Big West in scoring with 19.7 points per game, including 22.0 points during conference play. She also ranks first in conference in steals with 2.1 per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to stick to fundamental defense, just really bother her,” Nesbit said. “You try to make her job difficult and contest her shots and stay in front of her.”</p>\n<p>However, the Highlanders do feature four players averaging double-figures. One player that the Gauchos will keep an eye on is senior center Natasha Hadley. The only senior on the squad, Hadley has given Santa Barbara trouble in the past as she was Riverside’s leading scorer against UCSB in both matchups last year, averaging 17.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We have to get it done on the defensive end,” Zornig said. “It’s obvious we can score. Our offense is fine this year. But on the defensive end we’ve been struggling, so if we focus on that, we should be fine.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53667\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53667\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/","id":580,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[579,578,577],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Downed by Northridge","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB loses to Northridge after winning 14 straight","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It would be really easy to blame the offense in the UCSB women’s basketball team’s 64-46 blowout loss at home against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Scoring just 46 points, the lowest point total of the year for the Gauchos, Santa Barbara shot a measly 27.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>UCSB also committed 13 first half turnovers, allowing Northridge to go on a 17-2 run in which the Gauchos could never recover.

Northridge’s defense bothered the Gauchos’ offense the entirety of the game with Santa Barbara struggling to get a quality shot off. Only one player for UCSB finished in double-figures with Nesbit tallying 13 points and six rebounds on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Yet, this is Carlene Mitchell’s team and per usual for her, the problem was on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>“Some of (the offensive troubles) can be pressing too much. Some of that can be taking the wrong shots. I don’t worry about it,” Mitchell said. “It is the defensive side of it. I pulled the stats out from last year for the team and last year we scored 45, we scored 55 and maybe 47 against Northridge. So, here’s that double edge sword that we scored 70 in the first three games and most of the first half of the season, so offense is going to be the question, but my question is, ‘how can we score 46 but also win the game?’”</p>\n<p>Northridge shot 44.8 percent from the field. The Matadors also outscored the Gauchos 34-10 in the paint and outrebounded them 45-31.</p>\n<p>After allowing Northridge to go on the 17-2 run in the first half, Santa Barbara then didn’t contain the Matadors to open the second half, allowing them to start the final period on an 8-1 run, which eventually reached a game-high 24 points.</p>\n<p>“We know we need to stick to our defensive principles,” Nesbit said. “At times, we have lapses in defense, but we know as long as we continue to turn up the intensity on defense and stick to the fundamentals that we’ll be okay.”</p>\n<p>Needing to come from behind has become a recent trend for UCSB, falling behind by large deficits in all three Big West games, and the team hasn’t fared well, going 0-3 in those games.</p>\n<p>“As we continue on the season, we need to learn to put two halves together,” Nesbit said. “We sometimes come out flat in the second half and that tends to snowball, but we know that we need to come out with intensity in both halves.”</p>\n<p>Individually, Janae Sharpe led her team with 18 points, eight rebounds and four assists. She was one of three players in double-figures for Northridge. 6’3’’ sophomore center Bernadette Fong, who averages just 5.8 points per game, made UCSB pay down low, scoring 16 points.</p>\n<p>The loss snaps a 14 game win streak over Northridge and emphasized the struggles of UCSB recently. The team has dropped eight of its last nine games with its last win coming on Dec. 28.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the Gauchos remain winless in Big West play, dropping to 5-11 overall and 0-3 in conference. Northridge, on the other hand, improves to 7-11 overall and 3-1 in league.</p>\n<p>“We have the answers within us, but its how do we put that together?” Mitchell said. “Talent alone is never enough. I’ll continue to say in our conference, we’re one of the most talented, but at this point, we haven’t meshed as a team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to action Thursday against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/","id":579,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[578,577,576],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falters in Second Half, Start Conference 0-2","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos lose their second straight Big West road game, falling to Long Beach State 72-53.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">The second half has not been a friend of the UCSB women’s basketball team recently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">After going down just seven at halftime to Cal Poly and then losing by 18, the Gauchos once again went into the second half against Long Beach State competitive.

We were taking good shots, we were going inside-out and we were good on the defensive end of things. And then they went on a run to start the second half and we reverted to trying to fix everything with one pass and a quick shot or missed layups and then giving up transition points on the defensive end.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">With the inability to put two halves together, UCSB drops to 5-10 overall and 0-2 in the Big West.

In addition, UCSB has now lost both conference games by an average 18.5 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">Long Beach improves to 10-7 overall and 2-1 in conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">“Maybe the starters of the game aren’t the starters of the second half. Maybe those aren’t the same people,” Mitchell said. “You would hope by this point in the season that all of that would be in place and you wouldn’t have to think those things through, but again I understand they’re 18 year old kids. I try to remind them that they’re down 0-0.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">The first half saw a competitive match-up featuring two ties and nine lead changes. Despite outshooting and outrebounding the 49ers, the Gauchos headed into halftime down five.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">However, UCSB committed six turnovers in the first six minutes in the second half, allowing Long Beach to take a commanding lead, which reached 20 points with just over five minutes remaining in the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">“We stopped focusing on defense and they started getting rebounds,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “They got really comfortable. We had to sense of urgency. It was like no one wanted to pick it up and win the game.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">On the evening, Long Beach was clearly the aggressor, shooting 21-27 from the free throw line compared to 7-8 for Santa Barbara. In addition, the 49ers outshot the Gauchos 40.4 percent to 38.6 percent on the offensive end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">Junior guard Lauren Spargo led the 49ers offensively with 19 points, more than double her average of 8.6 points per game. The total ties her career-high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">“We tried a lot of different people,” Mitchell said. “We know she’s a great shooter. She stepped up big tonight with (junior guard Alex) Sanchez playing limited minutes and that’s what good teams do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">For UCSB, Mason took charge offensively for the second consecutive game, nearly tallying a double-double with 17 points and nine rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">“I just wanted to win,” Mason said. “Whatever the stats was, it didn’t matter. [The stats] just show how badly I wanted to win, but we didn’t pull it out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">The Gauchos will try to snap their losing streak this Saturday when they host Cal State Northridge for a rematch of last year’s Big West semifinal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Last Saturday, the Gauchos were blown out 88-70 by the Mustangs in the first Blue-Green rivalry game of the season. Two players nearly single-handedly took down UCSB with 6’5’’ senior center Molly Schlemer scoring a career-high 37 points and junior guard Ariana Elegado totaling 30 points.</p>\n<p>“You have to have a short term period, especially in conference because you have a game on Thursday and then a game on Saturday,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “I know I was thinking about it the entire weekend, so we have to let it go. Right now, we’re focused on Long Beach. They’re just as good.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers have compiled a 9-7 overall and 1-1 conference mark thus far, defeating UC Irvine before losing to UC Davis. In both games, Long Beach came from behind in the second half.</p>\n<p>After giving up 88 points against Cal Poly, the focus this week for UCSB is 100 percent on defense.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t worked on one thing offensively this week,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Early in the year, as a head coach, I made that adjustment [to run] because we had no bigs, but now as we go into conference play and into postseason, there’s no way we’re going to win unless we play defense.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Long Beach features balanced scoring and is a team currently playing through its guards. Freshman guard Raven Benton leads the 49ers at 14.4 points per game while two-time All-Big West honorable selection member Alex Sanchez averages 11.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“They have [Benton], who is pretty fast. She can knock down the jumper and get to the rim,” freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe said. “Then they also have two other bigger guards that can play a post. We just have to play some good ‘D.’”</p>\n<p>However, the 49ers’ recipe for success this season has been on the defensive end. They lead the Big West in steals with 11.2 per game, 13.5 during conference play and rank second in blocks with 4.1 per game.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, the Gauchos top the Big West in turnovers, giving the ball away just 13.7 times per contest.</p>\n<p>“The things that they do that’s messed with a lot of people is that they switch defenses every trip down the floor,” Mitchell said. “So whether they’re going 2-2-1, 1-3-1, or 3-2, they’re switching it up and it’s causing people to turn the ball over. Hopefully by us playing two point guards and four guards most of the time, it will alleviate some of the turnovers.”</p>\n<p>This matchup with Long Beach should suit Santa Barbara well as UCSB also plays through its guards. Senior guard Nicole Nesbit ranks third in the league in points per game with 17.6. Mason and senior guard Melissa Zornig, both of whom stepped up in San Luis Obispo, also average double-digits with 14.0 and 13.3 points per game, respectively. Mason scored a career-high 24 points Saturday and both Zornig and Mason shot 4-5 from three point range.</p>\n<p>As a result, UCSB is the only team in the Big West to feature three players in the top 14 in scoring.</p>\n<p>“It’s funny because we don’t even talk about it. We know our roles and what we need to contribute to the game,” Mason said. “We’re seniors putting the team on our backs because we have a lot of newcomers. We know the system, so we’re getting shots we know we shoot well at and knocking them down.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears on page 7 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>“They have a great one-two punch just about every night,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Schlemer remains the inside force and gives them a double-double every night. And then Elegado and [senior guard Jonae] Ervin just rotate on who’s going to carry the burden on the offensive end of it. [Ervin] had 37 in Hawaii and Elegado had 30 tonight. That’s tough when you’re trying to play zone and it’s hard to match-up one-on-one with Schlemer on the inside.”</p>\n<p>Schlemer led the way for Cal Poly, scoring a career-high 37 points on 16-20 shooting from the field. With 15 rebounds, Schlemer completed her eighth double-double of the season. Fronting, playing behind or trying to stop her in a zone, UCSB had no answer for the 6’5’’ reigning Big West Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Once she’s on the block, she just turns and she finishes,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “She’s very big. We have to make sure we have help-side and be aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Elegado finished the evening with 30 points, six rebounds and five assists, hitting big threes when the Gauchos went into a zone defensively to try to slow down Schlemer. Her 30 points is nearly double her season average of 15.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Overall, while Santa Barbara is known for its defense, it simply was no match for the Mustang’s offense. Overall, Cal Poly outshot UCSB 50.0 percent to 34.3 percent and outscored the Gauchos 46-16 in the paint.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, the loss marks the sixth straight defeat to the Mustangs, which improve to 8-7 overall and a perfect 2-0 in the Big West. The Gauchos, on the other hand, drop to 5-9 overall and 0-1 in conference play.</p>\n<p>“You want to win no matter who you play. I don’t care if it’s Cal Poly or the no-name school from whatever,” Mitchell said. “Our kids are going to compete and it’s game number one of the Big West. That’s what we know.”</p>\n<p>Knocking down threes in the first half, UCSB was able to keep the score close. UCSB was 6-9 from behind the arc in the opening period with Mason and senior guard Melissa Zornig both shooting 3-3 from downtown. Mason’s third three of the half brought the score within two at 36-34 with 2:31 to go, but Cal Poly finished the half on a 5-0 run, including a leaning three while on the run from Elegado at the buzzer.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos went ice cold to begin the second half, going 2-14 from the field. With Cal Poly’s offense showing no signs of slowing down, Santa Barbara lost all control of the game and remains winless against the Mustangs during the Carlene Mitchell era.</p>\n<p>“It was within striking distance,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes when kids try too hard, you shoot it short. We missed a lot of easy chippies right in the lane. It wasn’t just three pointers that we were taking. You have to compete and put the ball in the basket when you get open looks and that’s your responsibility.”</p>\n<p>One bright spot for UCSB was the play of Mason, who tallied a new career-high for the fourth time this season with 24 points on 10-17 shooting, including 4-5 from three-point range and a team-high six rebounds. Zornig also contributed 18 points.</p>\n<p>“I was just playing free,” Mason said. “If I had a shot, I [took] it and made sure I stayed on the attack. A few threes went down for me, so that was good, but I was just playing how I usually play.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will regroup and return to action on the road Thursday against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 13th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/","id":573,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[572,571,570],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Begins Big West Play at Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nic.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nic.jpg?resize=540%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos try to break a five-game skid against Cal Poly","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Head Coach Carlene Mitchell has accomplished a lot in her two and a half years at the helm of the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>She’s won a Big West Tournament Title and been to the NCAA Tournament.

I think for us seniors, it’d be huge to come out and beat them.”</p>\n<p>Both teams enter Saturday’s installment of the Blue-Green rivalry with recent struggles. At 5-8 overall, Santa Barbara has lost five of its last six games. Similarly, Cal Poly has dropped three of its last four, but Wednesday night improved to 7-7 overall and 1-0 in the Big West with a 78-74 overtime victory in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Playing a long game Wednesday in Hawaii and then returning home for a game Saturday presents a taxing travel schedule for the Mustangs. Last season, teams who played Hawaii at the beginning of the week went 0-4 in their following game that weekend.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, on top of the Blue-Green rivalry and defending a five-game winning streak over UCSB, Cal Poly will have the motivation of defending its home court, where the team is 5-0 so far this season.</p>\n<p>“You know you’re going to expect energy with the tradition these two programs have had and the rivalry,” Mitchell said. “I don’t have to say anything and I’m sure [Cal Poly Head Coach Faith Nimnaugh] doesn’t have to say anything for the players to show up and understand how important this game is.”</p>\n<p>The biggest problem in previous years for the Gauchos was the Mustang’s potent offense, which will once again serve as a challenge as Cal Poly tops the Big West in scoring with 74.9 points per game. Last year’s Big West Tournament Champions also rank second in the conference in field goal percentage and three point percentage, shooting 40.9 and 32.2 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Option number one on the offensive end for Cal Poly is the reigning Big West Player of the Year, 6’5’’ senior center Molly Schlemer. Schlemer ranks third in the Big West in points per game (17.8), first in rebounding (10.8) and second in field goal percentage (54.7 percent).</p>\n<p>Taking the assignment on Schlemer will be 6’4’’ junior center Clair Watkins, who averages a team-high 7.0 rebounds and 2.3 steals in her three games with UCSB after transferring from Vanderbilt.</p>\n<p>“All five times (we’ve lost) the problem has been on the defensive side of it. We have to try to figure out a way to guard Molly,” Mitchell said. “Even though (last year’s senior center Kirsten) Tilleman was blue-collar and had the toughness, she was legit 6’1’’,” Mitchell said. “This year, we’ve worked on a lot more zone, so I think we can mix it up a lot more where it’s not just one on one post defense.”</p>\n<p>However, Schlemer is one of just several options for the Mustangs offensively. The team also features two All-Big West honorable mention selections from last season in a pair of point guards. Junior Ariana Elegado is currently averaging 15.5 points and a team-high 4.6 assists per game, good enough to tie her for first in the Big West. Senior Jonae Ervin adds 10.8 points and 4.5 assists per game. Wednesday night against Hawaii, Ervin exploded for a career-high 37 points and team-high 10 rebounds to help her team come back from 17 down to win.</p>\n<p>“As seniors we know what to expect and I’m telling [our teammates], ‘be ready for these guards’ because they’re no joke,” Mason said. “They’re very talented and smart and know how to play together.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, if UCSB wants a chance for a victory, it will have to play incredible defense. While not as dominant as in previous years, the Gauchos still rank third in the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 69.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will then have to finish the job defensively by rebounding. Cal Poly leads the conference in rebounding at 43.9 per game while UCSB ranks last in the category with just 32.5 boards per game. In addition, in victories, the Gauchos average 37.8 rebounds compared to 29.2 in losses.</p>\n<p>“Whether you’re full fronting and you need to roll to get in rebounding position or you got caught behind, you have to put a body on [Molly],” Mitchell said. “She’s big and you have to make the refs call it. You’re not going to get any calls unless you block out and make contact.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB is a much improved team this year, putting up an average of 67.1 points on the scoreboard each outing, almost 15 more points per game than in Mitchell’s previous two seasons. The Gauchos also lead the Big West in field goal percentage, shooting 42.0 percent.</p>\n<p>However, while the Gauchos have succeeded with the fast break, Saturday will be all about defense.</p>\n<p>“We definitely don’t want a track meet. We’re not going to outscore anyone and I’ll continue to say that we have the ability to score high 60’s and 70’s any given night,” Mitchell said. “Defense will be the emphasis. I probably won’t even write any offenses on the board because I think if we can do the things we need to on the defensive end of things, we’ll have a chance to win.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday is set for 4 p.m. at Robert A. Mott Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They’re doing what you want as you build a program for your seniors to be able to do.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way offensively for UCSB is two-time All-Big West honorable mention selection Nicole Nesbit, who leads the team and ranks second in the Big West in scoring at 18.1 points per game. Shooting 46.8 percent from the field, the senior guard also tops her team in three-point shooting at 39.5 percent and assists with 3.4 per game.</p>\n<p>Returning to her natural position of shooting guard this season, Nesbit has been given the green light to score and will have the ball in her hands during clutch situations. On Dec. 19, Nesbit joined the 1,000 point club, one of just 25 players in program history to hit this incredible milestone.</p>\n<p>“She’s always had the God-given ability,” Mitchell said. “She has a great jumper; she can score in a variety of ways, but I think it’s more the mental side and the confidence (this year) that she doesn’t let one play to dictate her mindset the rest of the game.”</p>\n<p>The second of UCSB’s three seniors is known for her versatility and defense. Playing positions one through four this year, guard Destini Mason averages 6.2 rebounds per game, second on the squad and tops among guards. She also adds 1.1 steals and .6 blocks per contest.</p>\n<p>Yet, the most improvement for Mason can be seen on the offensive end. Currently averaging 13.2 points per game, Mason has broken her career-high three times already this season, culminating against Hampton when she scored 23 points, 10 higher than her career-high last season.</p>\n<p>“Destini has played multiple positions for us and she’s done a great job at the four spot,” Mitchell said. “It’s allowed her to be in rebounding position because that’s what we were lacking, but we’ll need to move her back to the three spot a lot because defensively she gives us a guard with length.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final senior has been known for her shooting since her arrival at UCSB, but this year, guard Melissa Zornig has developed into an all-around player. Doing a bit of everything for the Gauchos, Zornig is currently averaging 12.9 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game. At 2.5, she holds the highest assist to turnover ratio of the team, which is also good enough for third in the conference.</p>\n<p>Zornig also leads the team and the Big West in free throw percentage, shooting 88.4 percent. Combined with Nesbit, the two give UCSB two of the top three shooters from the charity stripe in the league.</p>\n<p>“Probably the biggest stat that stands out to me is her assist to turnover ratio,” Mitchell said. “She’s making the right decisions. She’s not shooting it as well from the three-point line, but she’s learned to score in a variety of ways, which makes her have an impact on games every night.”</p>\n<p>With their veteran leadership, UCSB’s “Big Three” have led the Gauchos to a 5-8 start. While its record may not look all that impressive, the team that has been to the postseason the last two seasons saw stiff competition during the non-conference portion of its schedule as Santa Barbara faced teams such as Arizona, St. Mary’s, San Diego State and Kansas State.</p>\n<p>UCSB lacks no experience playing in close games either with over half of the Gauchos’ games thus far being decided in the final minutes.</p>\n<p>“I think there are probably two or three games we had a chance to win, so our record would look a little bit different. But playing bigger, stronger, quicker in the non-conference will help us as we get to Big West play,” Mitchell said. “As a team, we’re where we need to be individually skilled wise and our team understanding roles.”</p>\n<p>The biggest problem in those losses was height. With only three forwards on the roster, and all being underclassmen, the average height on the Santa Barbara roster was 5’9’’.</p>\n<p>However, the height dilemma was resolved Dec. 20 when junior forward Clair Watkins was cleared by the NCAA to play for UCSB. At 6’4’’, Watkins transfers from Vanderbilt where she played two seasons with the Commodores. Now a grad student, the Gauchos had to wait for Watkins’ acceptance into the school. Once accepted, the NCAA immediately cleared her to play.</p>\n<p>In her three games as a Gaucho, Watkins has given Santa Barbara exactly what it was missing. Averaging 4.0 points and 1.0 block per game as well as team-highs in rebounding and steals with 7.0 and 2.3 per game, respectively, Watkins gives UCSB a defensive presence inside that will allow the team to compete with other teams in the Big West with height.</p>\n<p>“Clair allows us to be able to execute more in the half court, which I think all great teams have to at championship time,” Mitchell said. “With her body type and experience playing in the SEC, it is the defense and rebounding that will add the most to our team.”</p>\n<p>Currently last in the conference in rebounding at just 32.5 boards per game, rebounding has been a significant factor for UCSB in the win-loss column. Santa Barbara grabs 37.8 rebounds in victories compared to 29.2 in losses.</p>\n<p>“As soon as the ball goes up, we have to find a body and be aggressive,” Mason said. “Be the aggressor. We have to go after the ball. It takes heart, will and positioning.”</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s success in past years, with just five returning players from last season and a lack of height until the addition of Watkins, Santa Barbara remains the underdog going into conference play.</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason media poll, UCSB was predicted to finish fifth behind Cal Poly, Hawaii, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State. In addition, no Gaucho was picked to the preseason all-Big West Conference first team, although Nesbit is averaging more points than the reigning Big West Player of the Year, Molly Schlemer from Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Of course, the Gauchos don’t mind being the underdog. The last time they were in a similar position, they won the Big West Tournament as the sixth seed.</p>\n<p>“I’d rather be the underdog,” Zornig said. “We’ll go and prove people wrong.”</p>\n<p>In fact, this may be the team with the most potential under the Carlene Mitchell era as UCSB is putting more points on the scoreboard than any other team during Mitchell’s reign. Santa Barbara is currently averaging 67.1 points per game, much higher than the average 52.3 during the previous two seasons. The Gauchos also rank first in the Big West in field goal percentage, shooting 42.0 percent.</p>\n<p>In addition, despite the team’s new run and gun style, UCSB leads the conference in turnovers, giving the ball up just 13.8 times per contest.</p>\n<p>“When we pass the ball and we’re less selfish, we don’t have a lot of turnovers and we win the game, so I think that’s the main key to less turnovers is playing as a team,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>But at the heart of any team coached by Mitchell will always be defense. While not atop the Big West standings as in previous years, Santa Barbara still ranks third in the league in scoring defense, holding teams to 69.9 points per game.

\r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s a great compliment, and we appreciate that there’s so many people that have high regard for our program and our team,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “I think we’re a little overrated at this stage from the performance of where the team’s at currently, but I hope we can live up to that billing.”</p>\n<p>While Cal Poly currently stands at 6-7 overall, the team’s record is deceiving as the Mustangs have played incredible opponents during the preseason, taking on Stanford, Oregon, UCLA and St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p>“Like many teams in the Big West, we’ve tried to have really top competition in our preseason to try to play us for the great conference play that we expect,” Mimnaugh said. “You see what top 25 looks like and what size looks like.”</p>\n<p>Defeating Cal Poly will require great defense because this team knows how to put points on the board. The Mustangs lead the Big West in points per game at 74.9 while ranking second in field goal percentage and three*point percentage at 40.9 and 32.2 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ biggest offensive threat is down low in 6’5’’ senior center Molly Schlemer, the reigning Big West Player of the Year. Schlemer ranks third in the conference in scoring with 17.8 points per game and first in rebounding at 10.8 per contest. Her 54.7 percent shooting from the field also tops the league.</p>\n<p>“Molly Schlemer is a big reason for our success,” Mimnaugh said. “She’s pretty money when she gets the ball in her hands, and her teammates are always looking for her.”</p>\n<p>Yet, Schlemer is one of several options for Cal Poly, who also returns two All-Big West honorable mention selections from last year in junior guard Ariana Elegado and senior guard Jonae Ervin. Elegado currently averages 15.5 points and 4.6 assists per game, which ties for first in conference, while Ervin adds 10.8 points and 4.5 assists, good enough for third in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Both Jonae and Ariana picked up where they left off last year,” Mimnaugh said. “Jonae is one of the top assist to turnover people, so the ball is pretty safe in her hands. Ariana is a tremendous creator. We’ve got some littles that are entertaining.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s next game is Saturday when it hosts UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii</strong></p>\n<p>The Hawaii women’s basketball team is on a mission to redeem itself after last year’s disappointing second-round exit in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Rainbow Wahine finished with a 13-5 record in the Big West in large part to its efficiency on offense and defense; the team finished third both in scoring offense (61.1) and scoring defense (56.2). Despite earning a third place seed in the conference tournament, Hawaii was upset in the quarterfinal stage by Cal State Fullerton, the lowest-seeded team in the field.</p>\n<p>After nine months of lingering on that loss, the Rainbow Wahine are back with arguably the most dominant player in the Big West in senior forward Kamilah Jackson. Jackson is coming off a year where she was third in the league in points (15.5) and rebounds (9.7). It was the third straight season she led the team in points and rebounds.</p>\n<p>This year, Jackson was selected to the Preseason All-Big West team and has picked up where she left off last year. Averaging 16.7 points to go along with 10.0 rebounds, she has already amassed seven double-doubles. Jackson will have to be Hawaii’s best player on the court if it plans to advance further in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Hawaii enters conference play with an even record after losing and winning six games during its nonconference schedule. Yet, the team was picked to finish second in the Big West preseason media poll.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine has been victim to tough losses so far, losing to No. 24 Arizona by an 84-44 margin and against USC 66-55, where Jackson was held to just five points.</p>\n<p>However, the Rainbow Wahine has also come away with impressive nonconference results. Hawaii has defeated opponents from the Pac-12, SEC and Big 10 during the run-up to the conference opener against Cal Poly, showing potential of its capability to win the Big West title this season.</p>\n<p>Currently, Hawaii has not been as statistically efficient on offense as compared to last season as it ranks near the bottom of the league in points scored (64.8), while the team’s defense has kept them afloat; the team is second in points allowed (66.2). Still, Hawaii will have to have a balanced attack if they are to become serious contenders.</p>\n<p>Hawaii begins conference play with its first two games at home, taking on Cal State Northridge Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team had a rough start to its season, going 4-10 in non-conference play, but it is a serious contender to take the Big West.</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason media poll, the Matadors were selected to finish third place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>With one of the toughest nonconference schedules in the Big West, the Matadors saw extremely tough competition, taking on BYU, Washington State, Saint Mary’s and Oregon. While this gave CSUN many losses, the team also earned quality victories over incredible competition, earning a one-point victory over Pac-12 USC and a 12 point win over a talented Northern Arizona squad.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think there is anything we cannot improve on,” Head Coach Jason Flowers said. “We have to play with consistency and a focused mentality on every possession.”</p>\n<p>Playing such stiff competition, out of the nine teams in the Big West, offensively CSUN is eighth in shooting percentage, seventh points per game and eighth in three point shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>However, offense isn’t really Northridge’s bread and butter anyway. Under Flowers, the Matadors have proved a scrappy defensive team, ranking second in the Big West in steals with 9.6 per game.</p>\n<p>A young team in previous years, Northridge now features a core of upperclassmen.</p>\n<p>Among the Matadors, 5’5” junior guard Cinnamon Lister leads all scorers with 15.9 points per game. Junior guard Ashlee Guay also adds 14.3 points per game to give Northridge a respectable one-two punch.</p>\n<p>Shouldering the load of providing the post presence could be up to 6’3” sophomore center Bernadette Fong and 6’2” junior center Camille Mahlknecht. After averaging 5.2 and 6.4 rebounds per game, respectively, in the first half of the season, the Matadors will look for them to approach double digits. 6’2” senior forward Mikayla Thielges actually leads the team with 6.6 rebounds per game, but spends too much time around the perimeter to be counted on as the team’s primary board collector.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Mahlknecht gives the Matadors a serious defensive presence inside, easily topping the conference in blocks per game at 2.6.</p>\n<p>“If we focus on the process and approach the season one day at a time, one possession at a time, then the results will follow,” Flowers said.</p>\n<p>Northridge begins conference play today with a visit to UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State</strong></p>\n<p>The Long Beach State women’s basketball team enters the New Year with the best overall record in the conference at 8-6. After a middle-of-the-road 2013 campaign in which they finished with a 16-16 overall and 9-9 conference record, good for fifth place, the 49ers were predicted to finish fourth in this year’s preseason media poll.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better every week and finding more continuity,” Head Coach Jody Wynn said. “We’ve dealt with a lot of players coming in and out of the lineup due to sickness or injury, but I’m happy with our effort and our focus level that we’ve had throughout the preseason and the way we competed game in and game out.”</p>\n<p>Despite losing three of last season’s starters, Long Beach has not been slowed down by its consistent lineup changes. Although she has only started six games, freshman guard Raven Benton has impressed with team-high averages of 14.5 points and 5.4 rebounds per game as well as a 47.7 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been very pleased with how quickly Raven has adapted to the college level,” Wynn said. “She is not afraid of contact, so she’s able to get in there and fight for rebounds and she’s a natural born scorer. I always knew she had the potential to be a very good player for us.”</p>\n<p>Another young player making an impact for the 49ers is freshman guard Anna Kim, who leads her team with a 38.9 three-point percentage and 1.93 steals per game.</p>\n<p>A strong core of veterans has anchored a balanced Long Beach offensive attack that is averaging a solid 70 points per game. Junior guard Alex Sanchez has the team’s second highest scoring average with 11.2 points per game, while junior guard Hallie Meneses is averaging 8.0 points per game, team-highs of 4.1 assists per game and a 92.6 free throw percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a good strong core group of juniors that have multiple years of experience and with that being said our freshmen have been thrown into the fire right away,” Wynn said. “Anna Kim has certainly made an impact right away at the point guard position. We rotate lineups a lot; nothing is set in stone [at this point].”</p>\n<p>The 49ers are not particularly intimidating in the middle, but junior forward Ella Clark has averaged 1.64 blocks and 8.0 points per game.</p>\n<p>“The Big West has more parity than it’s ever had, so game in and game out it’s going to be a dogfight,” Wynn said. “It’s going to be a battle of will down the stretch of a lot of games.”</p>\n<p>With a strong, balanced offense, a confident start and a good mix of young and veteran players, Long Beach could very easily go beyond its preseason prediction and challenge for the Big West title.</p>\n<p>The 49ers begin conference play tonight against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis</strong></p>\n<p>With preseason play behind them, the UC Davis women’s basketball team boasts a young roster with veteran experience. Despite only having one returning senior, the Aggies possess key players such as junior forward Sydnee Fipps and sophomore guard Molly Greubel that will help to lead the team in this upcoming conference season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies ended the non-conference portion of their season with an overall record of 5-8.</p>\n<p>UC Davis women’s basketball was picked to finish sixth by the Big West preseason media poll. The Aggies earned 72 points from media members and were placed ahead of Cal State Fullerton, UC Irvine and lastly UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>The Aggies finished 12-18 overall last season, 7-11 in the Big West and were defeated in the first round of the Big West Conference tournament. This first round knock out was unusual for a team that has been to the Big West Championship half of its first six years in the league. Head Coach Jennifer Gross will return for her third season with hopes of taking her team all the way.</p>\n<p>The Aggies biggest asset towards hopes at a championship finish lies with Fipps. Fipps, a first-team All-Big West selection as a sophomore in 2012-13, earned all-conference honors in the preseason poll after starting all 30 games for the Aggies last season, averaging a team-high 17.1 points (second in the conference) and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting .443 from the floor, .319 from three-point range and .817 from the line.</p>\n<p>Her preseason performance was nothing short of this, tallying her second-straight double-double in their final game against Simpson University.</p>\n<p>Another promising player for this upcoming season is Gruebel. Despite her young age, Gruebel has demonstrated maturity and confidence on the court. She had a career night against Pacific with three assists, three steals and career high 18 points. In addition, she contributed two of the Aggies’ total five three-pointers.</p>\n<p>This Aggie team has knowledge working on their side. With a veteran team, and returning coaching staff they should be able to build upon what they have accomplished in preseason and work towards another shot at the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>UC Davis’ first conference matchup will be tomorrow, Jan. 9, against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine</strong></p>\n<p>With Big West play set to begin, the UC Irvine women’s basketball team has high hopes.</p>\n<p>At 7-7 overall, the season thus far has been somewhat surprising for the Anteaters. Although predicted to finish eighth in the Big West preseason media poll, if the season were to end right now, Irvine would find itself in second place in conference.</p>\n<p>Irvine currently ranks second in the Big West in scoring and rebounding, averaging 71.0 points and 43.0 rebounds per game. The Anteaters also place second in conference from behind the arc, shooting 31.5 percent.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Camille Buckley has been the Anteaters’ most significant contributor thus far, averaging 14.8 points and 9.2 rebounds per contest, good enough for third in the Big West. She shoots an impressive 48.1 from the field and has contributed a team-high 21 steals this season.</p>\n<p>Also a huge benefit to the team has been senior guard Jennifer Tsurumoto, who is averaging 13.4 points and 3.2 assists for Irvine. Then there is junior guard Madison McKenney, who leads the league in three-point percentage at 41.7 percent.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters have been dominant at the Bren Center in Irvine and are undefeated at home at 3-0. Through their undefeated home stance, UC Irvine has beaten South Dakota, New Mexico State and La Verne College.</p>\n<p>In Irvine’s latest game against La Verne, the Anteaters dismantled their opponent 90-53. Senior forward Jasmine Bernard led Irvine with a career-high 24 points and eight rebounds. The Anteaters 37-point victory was their largest since 1999.</p>\n<p>Irvine will open conference play today at Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton</strong></p>\n<p>“Our goal is to compete night in and night out to give our team the chance to win the Big West,” Head Coach Daron Park said. “The goal for our team, as well as every team, should be to end the season cutting the net down from the hoop.”</p>\n<p>Led by junior guard Chante Miles, the Cal State Fullerton women’s basketball team has a 4-9 record heading into conference play. Miles leads the team with 15 points per game, along with 4.2 assists and 2.8 rebounds.</p>\n<p>With four returning starters, the Titans have experience to build on their 11-22 record last season. Last year, Fullerton made it all the way to the Big West semifinal against the odds, almost overcoming Pacific to make the final.</p>\n<p>This season, the Titans were selected to finish seventh in the Big West, making them the underdogs once again.</p>\n<p>First-year coach Park brings intelligence from many different programs as he was Associate Head Coach at USC last year, and Assistant coach at California the year before that.</p>\n<p>“Every day when we come to practice, we make sure to work on the little things,” Park said. “If we can do the little things and compete for every ball then we always give ourselves the chance to win.”</p>\n<p>While just 4-9, Fullerton has faced still competition in the preseason as they played San Diego, Arizona St. and Seattle.</p>\n<p>“The difficult non-conference schedule has made us prepared for conference play,” Park said.</p>\n<p>Fullerton begins conference play tonight against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside</strong></p>\n<p>With its preseason record in pattern with that of the last two years, the UC Riverside women’s basketball team lands itself tied for eighth place going into Big West conference play.</p>\n<p>“We are very much younger than some of the other teams in the conference, having only one senior,” Head Coach John Margaritis said. “The more experience you have, the more advantages you have.”</p>\n<p>While the young Highlanders’ team continues to struggle to support the weight of the legacy that the 2011 conference champion team left behind, the team’s current 4-9 preseason record leaves Riverside toward the back of the pack.</p>\n<p>“The conference has changed, we’ve had a lot of injuries the last couple of years and we have a different team than the one that we won with,” Margaritis said.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss of older players in recent seasons, Riverside is home of guard Brittany Crain, returning for her sophomore year after being named Big West Conference Freshman of the Year. She is currently ranked first in the league in average points and steals per game and is ranked fifth in the league for field goal percentage.

\r\n</script> \n<p>A wearing schedule, five of Santa Barbara’s seven games have been decided in the final minutes. UCSB has gone 3-2 in those games.</p>\n<p>Tuesday night on the road at Pepperdine was no exception as UCSB overcame a 14-point first-half deficit to earn the 77-69 victory and the team’s second consecutive road win.</p>\n<p>“It was good for us to finally find ways to win. That’s going to be big for us because we do have a bit of inexperience on this team and as we continue to do that it will really help us,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We just battled. We had a tough first half and we could have quit after that, but we kept at it and knew what we had to do to pull that win out.”</p>\n<p>For the second straight game, Nesbit set a new career high, totaling 26 points on 8-15 shooting. This season, she averages 18.6 points per game and has been extremely efficient, shooting 47.9 percent from the field, including 51.9 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>All three seniors have been critical for the Gauchos this season with senior guard Destini Mason averaging 15.9 points and a team-leading 6.7 rebounds per game and senior guard Melissa Zornig averaging 12.6 points and a team-high 3.6 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with the seniors pulling their weight, Mitchell was waiting for one more player to step up. Against Pepperdine, Santa Barbara received that bench production, with junior guard Kristine Brance giving eight second-half points and five rebounds and sophomore guard Jasmine Ware tallying six points and providing plenty of defensive pressure. This allowed Mitchell to give her seniors a few extra minutes of rest, which is crucial with so many games in such a small period of time.</p>\n<p>“[Tuesday] we were able to trust Kris, Jasmine and [freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright] to give us at least 10 or 15 minutes and produce while they were out there, so I think that was instrumental,” Mitchell said. “It’s critical any time you can get Nic, Mel and Destini to be around the 30-minute mark. That only helps their production and will help us down the road as far as their legs and how many minutes we may need them to play down the stretch.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns home tonight with a 4-3 overall record. NAU, meanwhile, comes to the Thunderdome with a 1-2 mark.</p>\n<p>While the Lumberjacks are a balanced team, they should be a good matchup for the Gauchos as NAU lacks the height UCSB has seen in its last few games.</p>\n<p>“They’re a good team,” Nesbit said. “They don’t have as much size as we’ve seen in the past, but they have thicker guards that are going to be more physical and I’m sure will try to post us up. We’re going to see a bit of a different team than we have in the past.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Amanda Frost anchors Northern Arizona’s offense, averaging 21.7 points per game. In the team’s most recent victory over Utah Valley, Frost went off for 30 points.</p>\n<p>Another key matchup for UCSB will be junior forward Erikka Banks, who grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds in the team’s win. On the year, she averages a double-double with 10.3 points and 12.7 boards.</p>\n<p>“Banks is an interesting match-up because she’s 6’0’’, but she’s really a guard averaging 13 rebounds a game. She’s just a competitor,” Mitchell said. “Frost I would probably relate to Mel. She can shoot it, she can put it on the floor, and then around the basket she has euro step throughs, so she scores in a variety of ways.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, rebounding will be important for UCSB tomorrow A statistic that consistently predicts the result on the scoreboard, the Gauchos average 38.2 rebounds when they win compared to 25.3 boards when they lose.</p>\n<p>The other key factor for Santa Barbara will be turnovers. This season, UCSB averages an impressive 12.6 giveaways per game. On the other hand, the Gauchos would like to take advantage of the Lumberjacks’ turnovers as Northern Arizona has struggled with throwing the ball away, averaging 20 per game in its three games so far.</p>\n<p>“We’re making less mental mistakes,” Nesbit said. “Being aggressive, the turnovers we can live with are the ones in transition where you try to make something happen, but I think we’re starting to limit the unforced turnovers that happen for no reason. We’re playing a bit smarter and that’s something that’s really valuable for us right now.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/ucsb-plays-nau-at-home-in-third-game-in-six-days/","id":590,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[589,588,587],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Downed by NAU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos get blown out 79-56","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Typically the UCSB women’s basketball team is known for its defense.</p>\n<p>It’s how the Gauchos have won games the last two seasons.

On the game, Northern Arizona shot 56.9 percent, including 62.5 percent in the second half.</p>\n<p>“54 points in the paint – I think that’s the average number of points we gave up last year total,” Mitchell said. “Some of it was post defense on the weak side. We got caught behind on that and the second part of that is the screen and roll defense because we were getting beat to the middle of the lane on dribble penetration on the screen and roll. We just had breakdowns in every aspect of our man to man defense.”</p>\n<p>Despite holding the Lumberjack’s biggest offensive threat in senior guard Amanda Frost to 13 points, over seven points less than her season average, UCSB had no answer for junior forward Erikka Banks. One of five players in double figures, Banks totaled a double-double with 23 points on 9-11 shooting and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos were outrebounded 39-26, leading to an 18-6 second chance points advantage for Northern Arizona.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t block out. That’s just basic fundamentals of what we do,” Mitchell said. “As good as we’ve been against bigger teams – I thought we did a decent job against San Diego State and we did a decent job against a bigger, stronger, athletic Arizona team – we went away from all the fundamental principles tonight of doing the little things you have to do to win. They wanted it more than us tonight.”</p>\n<p>During the first half, Santa Barbara found a way to stay in the game due to its proficient shooting. Senior guard Nicole Nesbit tallied 13 of her 17 points and as a team, the Gauchos shot 42.9 from the field, allowing Santa Barbara to head into the locker rooms with the game knotted up at 30-30.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB went ice cold to begin the second half, going 1-7 from the field, which led to a 13-0 run by the Lumberjacks. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the shooting woes didn’t improve with time as the Gauchos shot a dismal 29.6 percent in the second half and were outscored 49-26.</p>\n<p>“In the second half, there was just no energy. I think from the beginning of the game there was no energy, but at least the first half we were hitting some shots,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “The second half, it seemed like we just stopped and gave up.”</p>\n<p>With the loss, Santa Barbara falls to 4-4 overall while NAU improves to 2-2 on the year. The game was the third in the last six days for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We have no excuses,” Mitchell said. “I think human nature, you can use that (we’ve played three games in six days), but once we play Big West we play Thursday and then on Saturday, so we can’t look at that as a reason for effort mistakes.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now receive a 10 day vacation for finals before travelling to Kansas State Dec. 15.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We’re starting to find ways to win and I’m really, really enjoying that,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “It’s always really fun when you have girls that are willing to battle it out for 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>Down the stretch, the Gauchos’ seniors stepped up and made clutch free throws, going 10-10 from the line. Tied at 67 with just over a minute and a half remaining, senior guard Melissa Zornig was fouled on her shot. She hit both free throws to give her team a two point lead and then Nesbit was fouled on her drive nearly a minute later, resulting in a four point advantage for UCSB after she drained both her foul shots. The two possession game would prove too much for the Waves to overcome.</p>\n<p>For the second consecutive game, Nesbit set a new career-high, tallying 26 points in the victory.</p>\n<p>“She’s just a warrior,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think sometimes against zones she gets hesitant, so I just challenged her to take over and that’s not a first for her anymore. Now she knows she can do whatever it takes for us to win and she shouldn’t feel bad if she needs to take 20, 10 or 50 shots for us to win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 4-3 overall, including 1-2 on the road, while Pepperdine drops to 2-6.</p>\n<p>“We had an attack mentality,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes in the past, our team has played not to lose instead of playing to win and I think our kids tonight knew they were going to win the game.”</p>\n<p>While the score might resemble a solid game by the Gauchos, the majority of the first half looked just the opposite for Santa Barbara. Grabbing 10 offensive rebounds and taking advantage of nine UCSB turnovers, Pepperdine jumped out to an early double-digit lead.</p>\n<p>The nine first half turnovers were only 3.5 less than the team’s season average of 12.5 per contest. However, UCSB gave the ball away just four times in the second half.</p>\n<p>“I think we were all kind of shaky (in the first half),” Zornig said. “When we play teams that play a zone, a lot of times we stand still and we freeze and a lot of times we panic and don’t know what to do.”</p>\n<p>Rather than waiting for the halftime break to regroup, UCSB found its stride with 2:13 to go in the first half. A jumper by Destini Mason sparked a 10-2 run to end the half, which was extended to a 17-4 to begin the second half, closing the gap to one point only two minutes into the second half.</p>\n<p>With a variety of players giving quality minutes in the second half, the Gauchos grinded out their second consecutive road victory. Mason and Zornig both came close to totaling double-doubles, combining for 29 points and 17 rebounds while junior guard Kristine Brance added eight points, all of which came in the second half, and five rebounds. Sophomore guard Jasmine Ware also contributed six points and five boards.</p>\n<p>“It was a great win. I’m not going to hesitate on that one,” Mitchell said. “We got critical minutes off our bench. Nic, Mel and Destini have been really consistent in their play, but we can’t win when they’re having to play 40 minutes a game, so tonight we were able to trust Kristine, Jasmine and [freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright] to give us at least 10 or 15 minutes and produce while they were out there, so I think that was instrumental that we had all nine players getting minutes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB receives just one day of rest before returning home to play Northern Arizona Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53347\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53347\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-04/ucsb-comes-from-behind-to-beat-pepperdine/","id":593,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[592,591,590],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels South to Face Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gauchos try to rebound from 71-67 loss to SDSU tonight against Pepperdine","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team’s ability to have short term memory will be tested this week.</p>\n<p>Just three days off a rough loss to San Diego State, the Gauchos play Pepperdine on the road tonight, the first of two games in the next three days.</p>\n<p>“We take each game game by game,” freshman point guard Onome Jemerigbe said. “It sucks to lose, but we have to let it go and move forward because we do have other games.

Even then, senior guard Nicole Nesbit was given a wide-open three to tie the game in the few second remaining, but missed.</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the team with a career-high 22 points. Moving over to the shooting guard position this season, Nesbit currently ranks third in the Big West in scoring with 17.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“When you play the point, the mentality is to pass first, shoot second,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Onome’s thought process is to dribble penetrate and get everyone else involved, so that frees up Nic and allows her to have legs late in the game because she’s not having to handle the ball against pressure for 40 minutes. In critical moments, she knows and understands we want the ball in her hands.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB shot a season-high 9-19 from three point range, in the second half, the team began settling for jumpers instead of attacking the rim, playing into the tactics of the Aztecs, who played a zone defense.</p>\n<p>Tonight, Santa Barbara will see a zone once again against Pepperdine, who will look to pack the paint.</p>\n<p>“Zones are so different for people and sometimes I smile and sometimes I want to pull my hair out because when you have players that can dribble penetrate and can shoot, they have all the different elements, but there’s something about a zone that sometimes makes them hesitant,” Mitchell said. “When you’re playing one on one or man defense, it’s a lot easier to use your skill or ability to either create your own shot or create for others. Zones make everyone have to be on the same page.”</p>\n<p>Pepperdine enters tonight’s matchup at 2-5. Losers of four straight games, all of which were on the road, the Waves return home in need of a victory.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very good team. We have seen some very talented individuals so far, but I think Pepperdine is the team that is the best overall team in understanding their roles and playing well together,” Mitchell said. “They’re balanced, play inside-out, they have skilled players as well as athletes, and they’re battle-tested. They played Oregon and UCLA close; they’ve won on the road in Seattle.”</p>\n<p>One player the Gauchos will keep an eye on defensively is junior guard Bria Richardson. Pepperdine’s leading scorer in five of its seven games, Richardson averages 16.6 points, 5.3 assists and 2.6 steals per contest.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at Firestone Fieldhouse.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>At 6’4’’, senior center Cierra Warren dominated the small Gauchos squad, scoring 21 points and a game-high seven rebounds on 9-10 shooting from the field. One of eight players on the roster listed at six feet or taller, she led SDSU to a phenomenal 65.9 percent shooting performance from the field, including 70.6 percent in the second half.</p>\n<p>Down four, Warren stepped outside and knocked down a three to bring her team within one at 45-44. She went on to score San Diego State’s next eight points to give the Aztecs a one point advantage just over halfway through the second half.</p>\n<p>“[Warren] started out at North Carolina. We know she could’ve played anywhere in the country,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I’ll have to go back and look at when she scored and how she scored. If we were in man, really the only body type that could match up against her was Big Mel.”</p>\n<p>Despite the Aztec shooting percentage, the Gauchos’ three point shooting kept them in the game. Ranked last in the Big West in threes with just 16 on the year entering the game, UCSB made over half its season total in one game, shooting nine of 19 from behind the arc for 47.4 percent.</p>\n<p>“We were getting wide open looks, but I think more towards the second half, we were taking shots too quickly and weren’t attacking as much as we should have,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “The mentality we should have had from the beginning was to attack.”</p>\n<p>The supremacy by both teams in their respective styles led to a game that would be decided in the final seconds.</p>\n<p>Down six with a minute and a half remaining, senior guard Melissa Zornig hit a three to bring the game within one possession. A steal on the inbounds and a converted layup from Nesbit completed a five-point swing, making a game that seemed over anybody’s game.</p>\n<p>“We were just trying to pressure it,” Zornig said. “We wanted to get the ball back. We wanted to press them and see what we could do with it.”</p>\n<p>In its full court press, UCSB forced SDSU to travel and was given the opportunity to take the lead with 48.5 seconds left in the game, but could not create a good shot on the offensive end. On the miss, Santa Barbara was forced to foul and freshman guard Ariell Bostick made one of two free throws to put her team up three.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, Nesbit, who had been hot from distance at 5-7 from behind the arc at the time, received an open look from the left wing, but the three bounced off the back of the iron.</p>\n<p>“We drew it up and knew we needed a look at a three,” Nesbit said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get the first shot, so Mel came in. She took a look at it and then I did get a good look. We did get the look we wanted. It just didn’t go in.”</p>\n<p>While the Aztecs improve to 1-4, the Gauchos drop to 3-3.</p>\n<p>“With the competitor I am, it’s disappointing to know that’s their first win of the season. That’s frustrating when you’re at home,” Mitchell said. “We had our opportunities. We went into halftime up six and we turned stagnant against that two-three zone (in the second half) and it cost us.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB shot 52.0 percent on the game and had three players in double-figures. Nesbit finished with a game-high and career-high 22 points while senior guard Destini Mason and Zornig tallied with 20 and 14 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“We had three players in double figures, but again, it’s our guards,” Mitchell said. “We have to find someone else to give us a scoring punch so [the seniors] don’t have to carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to rebound quickly from the loss as they travel to Pepperdine Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53343\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53343\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/","id":587,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[586,585,584],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":15,"route":"/authors/71"}},"__N_SSG":true}
