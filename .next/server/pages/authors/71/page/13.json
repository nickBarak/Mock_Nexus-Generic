We have to focus and knock down the open jumpers.”</p>\n<p>After halftime, UCSB couldn’t buy a basket. It wasn’t until a free throw by Johnson seven and a half minutes in that the Gauchos scored, which allowed USC to go on an 11-0 run.</p>\n<p>The first field goal for the Gauchos during the second half didn’t occur until 8:39 left in the game. At one point during the draught, UCSB was shooting just less than 15 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“To not score for 12 minutes and still have a chance to win is amazing,” Mitchell said. “And I told them, ‘I swear to God the basketball gods will open up the basket before long.’”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were in a big hole, down 36-18, but consecutive baskets by Johnson jumpstarted a 15-5 run to get her team back within a respectable deficit.</p>\n<p>“It’s our job as players to hit shots,” Johnson said. “We’re playing great ‘D’ but we have to put the ball in the hoop.”</p>\n<p>A three point play by Sweets Underwood brought the Trojans’ lead back down to single digits at 43-34, but the run by the Gauchos was just too little too late.</p>\n<p>“We have to put the whole 40 minutes together,” Johnson said. “We can’t dig a hole and then try to dig our way out in the last five minutes.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Cassie Harberts led the Trojans with 17 points. On the other side, Johnson struggled offensively, but still managed 13 points, a team high. Nicole Nesbit, who also played a large role in the comeback, tallied 11 points on the evening.</p>\n<p>“[Harberts is] extremely skilled,” Mitchell said. “She can not only hurt you on the low block but can also hit the 17-footer. She’s very versatile.”</p>\n<p>The bright spot on the evening for UCSB was their defense, which held a USC team that averages 64.7 points to just 50. The Gauchos also did a solid job on the boards and were outrebounded by just two to a much taller team.</p>\n<p>“The kids are playing their butts off on the defensive end and that should give us a chance to win,” Mitchell said. It’s the consistency. We’re putting up 8-10 turnovers and barely being outrebounded. We have to have a chance to win at some point if our shots fall.”</p>\n<p>UCSB resumes conference play this Saturday against rival Cal Poly at home.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44253\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-usc-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44253\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-usc-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-usc-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-usc-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-usc-road/","id":772,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[771,770,769],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hit the Road to Take on Trojans","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team takes a break from conference play tonight to take on USC, the strongest team on the schedule for this year.

This will be a great mental test for our team — to see if we’re going to continue to fight because it’d be real easy to lie down after two home losses.”</p>\n<p>The Trojans will certainly provide that test, especially offensively. Four players average 11 points per game or higher. In addition, USC also has four players shooting 40 percent or better from three-point range, a spot on the court where opponents have been successful against the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“They’re challenging and we all know that,” Mitchell said. “[They have] Kodak All-Americans and McDonald’s All-Americans, so it’ll take us to a place we probably haven’t been yet as far as the talent level.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue to rely on their defense to keep them in games, only giving up 50.7 points per game, the best in the Big West. But to have a chance to win the game, the Gauchos will have to find a way to score. The Trojans average 65 points per game, compared to UCSB’s 52.6.</p>\n<p>“We’ll guard them hopefully a little tighter than anyone else has this year,” Mitchell said. “And we’ll have to do a good job on the rebounds.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding will definitely be important because UCSB will be at a height disadvantage. While the Gauchos have two of the best rebounders in the Big West in junior center Kirsten Tilleman and junior forward Sweets Underwood, every member of the team is going to have to find a body and box out.</p>\n<p>“We know what we can do and we have to continue to do that well,” Mitchell said. “[It’s going to take] an ‘A’ game for us to have a chance to win.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit currently leads UC Santa Barbara in scoring, averaging 9.3 points while coming off the bench.

In the first half alone, the score was tied nine times and there were five lead changes. After halftime, a 6-0 run led by senior forward Kelsey Adrian seemed to give UCSB control over the game.</p>\n<p>However, back-to-back three-pointers down the stretch from Erica McKenzie and Kendall Rodriguez tied up the game with over two minutes remaining. Two more jumpers, one from McKenzie (14 points total), completed a 10-0 run by the Tigers.</p>\n<p>Down 46-50, Adrian fired a shot from downtown that would’ve given life to UCSB, but the shot didn’t go in and Pacific was able to clinch the victory.</p>\n<p>“It was a wide open look and I should’ve knocked it down,” Adrian said. “When it left my hand I thought it was good, but then it wasn’t.”</p>\n<p>UCSB looked great on paper. The Gauchos outshot Pacific 38.5 percent to 34 percent from the field and kept their turnovers low with just nine, yet struggled with both rebounding and ball control.</p>\n<p>“You can’t expect to win at home when the opposing team gets more free throws and when you’re out-rebounded by a team that’s basically more undersized than we were,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were out-rebounded 39-31 and outscored 11-4 on second chance points, which made a huge difference in such a close game. The exception for UCSB was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who grabbed 12 boards, while also contributing eight points, three assists, two steals and two blocks.</p>\n<p>“We had one player hit the boards and that can’t happen and expect to win,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>The other glaring issue was free throws. Pacific attempted 19 free throws and shot 78.9 percent from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled from the line, shooting 53.3 percent, which is very uncharacteristic of the team that leads the Big West in free throw percentage at 74 percent.</p>\n<p>“[Free throws were] the difference in the game,” Mitchell said. “The free throws are free and if you get up to the free throw line and you’ve worked hard enough to get there, you have to knock them down. That’s a focus thing and that’s a mental toughness part of the game.”</p>\n<p>Every player that stepped on the court for UCSB had at least one basket, with sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit leading the way with 10 points.</p>\n<p>“They were pressing, but we were able to break it a few times and that led to transition baskets,” Adrian said. “We were able to distribute [the ball].”</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to rebound quickly for a nonconference matchup Tuesday on the road against USC.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43999\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43999\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/","id":768,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[767,766,765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Pacific in Big West Tiebreaker","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  UCSB women’s basketball will seek revenge Saturday afternoon against Pacific, which stunned the Gauchos at home last season in the first round of the playoffs to end UCSB’s season.

We’re going to come ready and fired up. I’m looking forward to getting back on the court because I know we all have the feeling of … not good.”</p>\n<p>The Big West’s best defense and offense will square off in Saturday’s contest. UCSB allows only 50.7 points per game and holds its opponent to 36.5 percent from the field, also a league best.</p>\n<p>However, while the Gauchos like to slow down the tempo, Pacific wants to score. They average 71.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Pacific’s going to be just more reminders and refreshers on things because they’re like other teams we’ve already faced,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “If we play like we did in the second half [against Davis] and bring that to the first half of Pacific and we have forty (complete) minutes, I’ll feel real good about our chances.”</p>\n<p>Like UC Davis, who found success from behind the arc, Pacific likes the three point shot. The Tigers are second in the Big West in three point field goal percentage.The scoring for Pacific came from multiple players. Three of the top nine scorers in the Big West are Tigers: Erica McKenzie, Ashley Wakefield, and Kendall Rodriguez. The three each average 12 points per game.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very athletic team and they’re going to create some problems in some matchups,” Mitchell said. “But if we worry about us, then we’ll be okay.”</p>\n<p>Pacific takes advantage of their athleticism, which on the defensive end results in steals. The Tigers lead the league in this category.</p>\n<p>The game against the Tigers could also serve as payback for a home loss to UC Davis last night. Despite an ugly first half that left the Gauchos trailing by 18 at halftime, UCSB mounted a comeback that almost succeeded.</p>\n<p>“It was a tale of two halves,” Mitchell said. “Unfortunately the game is for 40 minutes. If we had brought the effort that we brought to the floor in the first half like we did in the second half, we would’ve had a chance to win.”</p>\n<p>A different UCSB team showed up for the second half and immediately took momentum with an 8-0 run. They chipped away at Davis’ lead throughout the final 20 minutes, holding the Aggies to 18 points in the second half, and found themselves down just three with 24 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“Any time you hold a potent scoring team like Davis to 18 in the second half … you’d think you had won the game,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>UCSB was forced to play the fouling game, and lost, as Samantha Meggison converted her free throws down the stretch. Meggison shot 8-10 from the line and finished with 15 points.</p>\n<p>“The kids decided to play and that’s all I can say,” Mitchell said of the comeback. “They wanted to win, but they have to understand that you’re playing great teams and also when you’re at home, you can’t dig yourself into a whole.”</p>\n<p>Turnovers plagued UC Santa Barbara against the tenacious, trapping defense of UC Davis. The Gauchos threw the ball away 21 times.</p>\n<p>The Aggies also killed the Gauchos with treys, especially in the first half, shooting 54.5 percent. UCD leads the league in three pointers per game with 7.3.</p>\n<p>“When one player makes one, the basket seems to get a little bigger,” Mitchell said. “Give them credit because they’re shooters and that’s what they do. But it seemed the second half our hand was there a little bit quicker.”</p>\n<p>Johnson was UCSB’s best player for the night with 13 points, six assists, and three steals. Nesbit also added 11 points. But it was the Aggies’ Hannah Stephens that led all scorers with 16 points, including 4-5 from downtown, although 14 of those points came in the first half.</p>\n<p>“She got that first three and that set the tone, so that’s on me,” Johnson said. “Give credit to Davis because they came out to play the first half. We’re going to put it together and we’re going to continue to fight.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off tomorrow against Pacific is set for 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43985\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43985\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/","id":769,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[768,767,766],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes on Reigning League Champs UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team will look to ride the momentum created from its double overtime victory against Northridge Saturday when the team hosts last year’s winner of the Big West tourname...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled-34.jpg?resize=251%2C149\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"149\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">The UCSB women’s basketball team will look to ride the momentum created from its double overtime victory against Northridge Saturday when the team hosts last year’s winner of the Big West tournament, UC Davis, tonight.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are 8-9 overall and 3-3 in the Big West, sitting in a tie for fifth place.

The Gauchos’ offense, which has been inconsistent all season, will face Davis’ tenacious trapping defense. UCD currently leads the Big West in turnover margin at +5.39, with opponents throwing the ball away 20.3 times.</p>\n<p>“They’re going to be very extended and aggressive on defense,” senior forward Kelsey Adrian said. “We just need to take care of the ball and not turn the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, they rarely turn the ball over, leading conference with only 14.2 per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re really just looking to remain calm and not [have] any unforced turnovers,” junior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “We want to be there for each other when we are trapped and be in the positions that will allow us to get out of it.”</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt the Aggies defense is impressive, but it comes in second only to UCSB, which thrives on slowing down the tempo, allowing just 50.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>UC Davis hopes to give the top ranked defense a run for its money with its Princeton offense, which features a lot of movement without the ball. Also, expect threes from UC Davis and expect them to fall. The team leads the league in three point shots made per contest, averaging 7.3.</p>\n<p>“We know there’s lots of movement and lots of cutting, so we need to make sure we’re between them and the basket,” Adrian said. “[But we also] have to be out on the shooters and get our hands up.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies are also unique in that they play a four-guard lineup.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that can be a mismatch when we’re trying to play Sweets and Tilleman,” Mitchell said. “Those two know they’re going to be guarding a guard all night long. You can’t go for steals, you can’t reach, and you have to keep them in front of you.”</p>\n<p>However, this gives UCSB the rare opportunity to exploit a height advantage.</p>\n<p>“We don’t usually have height advantages because we’re not a very tall team, so hopefully we’ll really work on our inside outside game, which will be very effective against a really high trapping defense,” Tilleman said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos should be able to get on the boards, too, against an Aggies team that falters at rebounding, grabbing the least amount of defensive rebounds in conference. UCSB features two of the top six rebounders in the Big West in Tilleman and junior forward Sweets Underwood.</p>\n<p>“Every game rebounding is important, but especially if we have a height advantage, we better be rebounding even more than usual,” Tilleman said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43903\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43903\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/","id":802,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[801,800,799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins 2OT Thriller at CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It takes big plays to win a double overtime game.

Northridge was forced to foul and Johnson, a 94 percent free throw shooter, drained them both to give her team a 50-47 lead.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the game, there’s no better player to have on the line,” Mitchell said. “Free throws are very mental and she showed her mental toughness.”</p>\n<p>Then, Matador freshman forward Jessica Duarte came to the rescue for her team, hitting a three with just seconds remaining to send the game to overtime.</p>\n<p>“I saw [the shot] go in the air and I just was like, ‘please don’t go in, please don’t go in,’” Adrian, whose 17 points tied her career high, said. “[The shot] bounced around on the rim for a bit and went through. From there we had to regroup and focus on overtime.”</p>\n<p>In overtime and in need of points, it was Adrian who knocked down a critical three-pointer for UCSB, tying the game at 58 apiece.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos once again found themselves playing defense in the final possession. With the score tied, Johnson took a charge, sending the game to double overtime.</p>\n<p>Adrian got UCSB on the board first in 2OT. Up 65-64 with the period almost over, she came up with a crucial steal on the defensive end. The Matadors’ coach thought she stepped on the end line and was called for a technical.</p>\n<p>The foul call led to two made free throws by Johnson, who also converted on another four freebies to clinch the game. She shot 8-8 from the line overall.</p>\n<p>As they usually do in close games, free throws played a vital role. Over the course of the game, Northridge spent a lot of time at the charity stripe, shooting 27-38, but couldn’t hit them when it mattered most.</p>\n<p>Yet free throws kept Northridge in the game. UCSB held the Matadors to 31 percent shooting. Meanwhile, UCSB shot a solid 42.6 percent from the field, a much stronger performance than in its horrible loss to Long Beach State Thursday.</p>\n<p>“We were attacking,” Adrian said. “We were back on our heels against Long Beach, but with Northridge, we really took it to them.”</p>\n<p>After a 10-0 run late in the first half, the Gauchos entered the second half with a 28-24 lead. After halftime, UCSB’s lead grew to 11, but Northridge battled back, creating the dramatic finish.</p>\n<p>“They really started attacking and we’re getting to the rim,” Adrian said. “They were drawing fouls and getting to the free throw line.

For UCSB, sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit also contributed 11 points.</p>\n<p>“That’s [Sharpe’s] MO — to get to the rim and draw fouls,” Mitchell said. “We can learn from her because it doesn’t matter how you score.

After quickly going down 5-0, Mitchell yanked all five starters.</p>\n<p>“Starting is a responsibility,” Mitchell said. “It’s their responsibility to set the tone and I didn’t feel like they did that. Everything we did was a second delayed.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit provided the needed spark off the bench to score the Gauchos’ first four points of the game. Nesbit, who may have provided the only positive on the evening, totaled 11 points.</p>\n<p>“Nicole has been pretty consistent the entire year,” Mitchell said. “If there was one shining point tonight, it was that Nicole gave us some consistency.”</p>\n<p>Lucky for UCSB, the 49ers also had a slow start, keeping the Gauchos in the game.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos closed the gap to 13-12, senior forward Tipesa Moorer hit a jumper to start a 11-2 Long Beach run to end the first half.</p>\n<p>In fact, Moorer seemed to find an answer every time UCSB even thought about finding some offensive momentum. She finished with 14 points on the evening.</p>\n<p>“Moorer had a great first half,” Nesbit said. “She seemed to be in the zone. She was hitting her shots and getting everything she wanted.”</p>\n<p>After halftime, everything continued to go wrong for the Gauchos. At the 14 minute mark, the 49ers doubled up on UCSB 32-16 and about a minute later, LBSU saw their biggest lead of the game at 19 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s like it’s contagious,” Mitchell said, who compared her team’s offensive cold streak to a disease. “That basket gets really small, but it’s inexcusable. It’s unfortunate tonight that that disease hit, like, five players.”</p>\n<p>UCSB narrowly avoided going into the record books as one of the program’s lowest scoring games. Back in the 1970’s, UC Santa Barbara twice scored 32 points.</p>\n<p>“The open shots were there,” Mitchell said. The right people were taking the shots. Unfortunately they just didn’t fall.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, while the Gauchos only tallied five assists and shot 27.8 percent from the field (compared to Long Beach’s 36.7 percent), UCSB was getting good shots, which eventually will land.</p>\n<p>“We have to put this game behind us,” Nesbit said. “Two-game road trips are always hard, but we just have to move on because we can’t let this loss affect our next game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to rebound this Saturday at Cal State Northridge. Tip-off is set for 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/","id":795,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[794,793,792],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Take on CSULB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After an easy victory against UC Riverside last weekend, the UCSB women’s basketball team will see tougher competition when it hits the road to face Long Beach State tonight.

We’re going to see some zones, so we’re going to have to execute a little quicker.”</p>\n<p>Like UCSB, the 49ers feature a balanced attack on offense. Three players average 9.3 points or higher. Senior forward Tipesa Moorer leads the attack with 12.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>“[Moorer’s] a little undersized but she’s been putting up big numbers,” Mitchell said. “She’s a mismatch problem because they’re basically playing four guards and that can sometimes get us in trouble because Tilleman’s more comfortable playing post defense.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also have to keep an eye on freshman guard Alex Sanchez. Averaging 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds, Sanchez is a very versatile player who can play many positions.</p>\n<p>“They’re all very athletic and quick,” sophomore guard Melissa Zornig said. “I think as long as we play our defense and execute on the offensive end we should win the game.”</p>\n<p>Saturday against UCR, UC Santa Barbara found their offensive stride. Offensive execution has been a weakness for the Gauchos, so the team hopes the offensive fluidity will carry with them on the road.</p>\n<p>“I think we were finally hitting some shots,” Zornig said. “In games like that, when we come fired up, the flow of the game is a lot better and then that’s when we start hitting shots.”</p>\n<p>Underwood especially was on fire in their last game, scoring a team-high 16 points after recently returning to the starting line-up.</p>\n<p>“[I’m] just going in and doing all that I can to contribute to the team to get a ‘W,’” Underwood said. “[For Long Beach], I’m focusing on rebounding and the things I can control.”</p>\n<p>Playing on the road is never easy, but Long Beach is especially great at home at 6-2.</p>\n<p>“I know they just had a tough stretch on the road, but Long Beach is a lot better team at home,” Mitchell said. At the end of the day, if you want to win conference, you have to win road games.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Thursday is set for 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43670\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43670\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/","id":794,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[793,792,791],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Team Effort Overcomes UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It was a true team win for UCSB women’s basketball on Saturday afternoon when the squad knocked off UC Riverside 63-43 at the Thunderdome.

Underwood led the attack with 16 points while also contributing seven boards.</p>\n<p>“Coach has emphasized coming out early and setting the tone,” Underwood said. “I’ve obviously been struggling the last few games, so to be able to come out here tonight and play well, it feels great.”</p>\n<p>A 6-2 UCSB run to end the first half gave the Gauchos momentum, which UC Santa Barbara seized and used to gradually pull away.</p>\n<p>“Any run for us is good,” Mitchell said. “I wasn’t satisfied, and I just told the team that we needed to win by 20 points. I knew for our mindset going into these next two road games that we had to win by 20 for our own benefit and mindset.”</p>\n<p>The 20-point win was the highest margin of victory for the Gauchos all year.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Kelsey Adrian put the team on her back in the second half, scoring 13 of her 15 points after halftime. She found her touch from behind the arc, knocking down three treys.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a mentality that we all have — that we’re going to keep shooting and the shots are going to fall,” Adrian said. “But, we weren’t just trying to shoot threes. It was getting to the basket, moving the ball around, and finding the open player.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit contributed nine points, all of which came in the first half. And then there was Emilie Johnson, who went without a field goal, but still left her mark with seven rebounds, four assists, three steals and no turnovers.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos out-rebounded the Highlanders 45-26 and gave up only one offensive board.</p>\n<p>“I threatened them on the day off — the one day to prepare — that we were just going to do all rebounding drills,” Mitchell said. “Maybe the reverse psychology worked on them, but we emphasize that every day.”</p>\n<p>For a team that has struggled offensively, UC Santa Barbara looked much smoother on the attack against UCR. Sixty-three points is well above the team’s average of 52 and was its second highest total of the year. They also shot 41.3 percent from the field and tallied 18 assists (a season high), while limiting their turnovers to just nine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos resume play next week with two tough games on the road against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-17/gaucho-team-effort-overcomes-ucr/","id":789,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[788,787,786],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Conference: Women’s Basketball Preview","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UC Santa Barbara: Gauchos There’s been a lot of change for the UCSB women’s basketball team in the past year — a new coach and a new system — but last year’s co-champions of the Big West loo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>UC Santa Barbara:</strong> <strong>Gauchos</strong></p>\n<p>There’s been a lot of change for the UCSB women’s basketball team in the past year — a new coach and a new system — but last year’s co-champions of the Big West look ready to contend for another title.</p>\n<p>An adjustment period with new Head Coach Carlene Mitchell, whose team sits just below .500 at 6-7 with a 1-1 conference start, was to be expected.

We want to win.”</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason polls, UCSB was predicted to finish second, right behind conference foe Cal Poly. The two teams received the same number of first place votes, but Cal Poly received more points overall.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos weren’t thinking about the polls. They were concerned with adjusting and readying themselves for conference play. Their preseason schedule included some stiff competition, such as St. Mary’s and Washington State.</p>\n<p>“I think we had a great schedule,” Johnson said. “It was tough and it prepared us for conference.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began conference on the road, facing rival Cal Poly first. As expected, the game went down to the wire. A three-point play by senior guard Ashlee Burns with 2.3 seconds remaining left the Gauchos winless to start conference for only the second time in the last 17 seasons.</p>\n<p>A week later, Mitchell earned her first conference win as head coach against Cal State Fullerton 39-37, although it wasn’t the Gauchos’ best showing.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing that hasn’t changed for the Gauchos this season, it’s their tenacious defense. UCSB allows opponents a mere 49.6 points per game, the best in the Big West and seventh in the nation. In eight of their past 10 games, their opponent hasn’t scored over 50 points. Furthermore, the Gauchos have held their opposition to 37 percent shooting, also first in the conference.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to try to outscore teams, but we’re going to try to make it hard on opponents on the defensive end,” Mitchell said. “That’s what I’m about and that’s what this program is about. We have to control what we can, which is defensive intensity.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, there is no apparent leader for UCSB. Certainly no player will be found atop the Big West rankings, but that is Mitchell’s strategy on offense: balance. UCSB has a deep team with many players who can make a difference.</p>\n<p>“Every player should have the confidence to be the go-to player if we need them to,” Mitchell said. “Then teams can’t focus on one player.”</p>\n<p>Currently, junior forward Sweets Underwood leads the team in scoring at 8.9 points per game. She is also second on the squad in rebounding at 7.8 per game, placing her sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets] has that ability to get a double-double every night,” Mitchell said. “Sweets understands we’re not asking too much for her and her athleticism.”</p>\n<p>While Johnson, who played for Team USA in October, has been inconsistent in finding her shooting touch thus far, she continues to lead her team by doing the less noticed things, like distributing the ball and getting steals. She leads the team in both categories with 2.8 assists and 1.2 steals per contest, while still averaging 8.4 points.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [Emilie] has to score for this team to be successful,” Mitchell said. “She’s such an unselfish player, and she understands it’s important to be a distributor and set the tempo. If she has five or six assists, that means 10 or 12 points.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s other senior and captain, Kelsey Adrian, has recently found her stride in the new system, especially from behind the arc. The guard shoots 42.6 percent from three point land, good enough for second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The two sophomore guards Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig have also proved themselves as offensive threats, averaging 8.6 and 8.2 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a good mix [of players],” Adrian said. “ We have some super athletic players and some shooters. We’re really complimentary of each other. We’re not as big as other teams, but we’re bigger and have bigger basketball IQs.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Kirsten Tilleman cleans up the paint under the hoop night in and night out. She ranks second in rebounds in the Big West at 8.6 per game.</p>\n<p>“[Kirsten] is instrumental to our success so far,” Mitchell said. “She has to guard the other teams’ tallest and most physical players. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the effort and intensity every night.”</p>\n<p>As Coach Mitchell has preached all year, it most likely will be the little things that determine the Gauchos’ run for a title. Defense is their bread and butter, but rebounding and turnovers may make the difference.</p>\n<p>“Rebounding and limiting turnovers have been our keys all year long,” Adrian said. “We’re smaller, so blocking out is going to win or lose us games.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, Santa Barbara’s weakness seems to be consistent offensive production as they continue to work on executing on the offensive end. As a result, they score the least in conference at 51.1 points per game, but overall they still maintain the greatest scoring margin (+1.5).</p>\n<p>“We emphasize [defense],” Johnson said. “That’s been our identity: our toughness on that end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host UC Riverside this Saturday in the Thunderdome at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: Mustangs</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly women’s basketball went 3-9 and lost seven consecutive games entering conference play. They opened conference with two straight wins. The lesson: last year’s Big West co-champions and this year’s predicted league champs by the preseason polls should never be counted out of the mix.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited and honored to be selected to win it, but we know we’re a long way off of that and know we have to earn it every single day,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “We had some really good competition in preseason and I think it’s prepared us all for the great competition we’re going to face in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs lost last year’s Big West Player of the Year, Rachel Clancy, they return with arguably an even more dangerous threat. Redshirt senior and 2009-10 Big West Player of the Year Kristina Santiago, who missed last year with a torn ACL, is back in action. Against San Diego State on Dec. 21, Santiago made the bold statement that she is completely back, tallying a career high 44 points.</p>\n<p>“We definitely have a different team, [which is] trying to put it together so we can have as successful a year,” Mimnaugh said. “Santiago is obviously one of the main reasons for that success. She is by all accounts an all-star and somebody that I’m sure the WNBA is having a really close look at as far as an addition to their league.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, the 6’1’’ forward has averaged 24 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. Both statistics are good enough to lead the Big West and nationally rank her fifth and 17th, respectively.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Ashlee Burns is Cal Poly’s third leading scorer at 8.8 points per game. Opponents should watch out for her three-point shooting; she averages 36.7 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Ashlee Burns has been a terrific three-point shooter and somebody we count on to extend the defense so they can’t completely collapse on Kristina,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Mustangs are extremely strong offensively, preferring high scoring games. They lead the Big West, averaging 72.1 points per outing. The also lead the league in field goal percentage (42 percent) and assists (14.4).</p>\n<p>“We love up-tempo,” Mimnaugh said. “If we can score in the 70s, we’re usually on the victory side.”</p>\n<p>Consequently, Cal Poly also allows their opponents the most points in the Big West, so their game plan is simple: outscore the other team.</p>\n<p><strong>Pacific: Tigers</strong></p>\n<p>The University of the Pacific was picked to finish eighth in the Big West in the Preseason Media Poll, but already has almost as many wins as they did all of last year. The Tigers went 5-11 in conference play last season (9-22 overall) and entered the Big West Tournament as the seventh seed. There, they upset second seed UCSB in the first round before falling to first seed Cal Poly in the second round.</p>\n<p>This season, Pacific is currently in third place in the conference at 2-1 (8-6 overall). The Tigers went 6-5 through a tough nonconference schedule, including a trip to second-ranked Connecticut, and feel they are prepared for Big West play.</p>\n<p>“Now we get into the rhythm of conference play,” Head Coach Lynne Roberts told pacifictigers.com. “The Big West is going to be a close race. We know [each game is] going to be very tough.”</p>\n<p>In its first conference game against Cal State Fullerton on Dec. 29, Pacific won 72-67. In its next showing on Jan. 5 at UC Irvine, the Tigers lost in overtime, 77-75, but rebounded with a big win on Jan. 7, 80-59 at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Early in the season, there were indications that the Tigers were on track for an improvement from last year. On Dec. 5, junior guard Erica McKenzie was named Big West Player of the Week, and on Dec. 12, junior guard Ashley Wakefield earned the same award. McKenzie averages 12.4 points per game, and Wakefield is the team’s leading scorer at 12.6 points per game. On the defensive side, sophomore guard Gena Johnson is third in the conference in blocked shots with 1.4 per game.</p>\n<p>One area Pacific has found success is from behind the arc. McKenzie has made a conference-leading 34 three-pointers thus far this season, and junior Kendall Rodriguez leads the conference in individual three-point field goal percentage with .440. Overall, the team has the second-best three-point field goal percentage in the Big West with .344.</p>\n<p>Roberts hopes that the team can sustain these areas of success, which have contributed to its exceeding expectations so far.</p>\n<p>“Our focus now is making sure our players understand we have momentum, but we’re not where we want to be yet,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis: Aggies</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis women’s basketball team enters the season as defending champions of the Big West conference, after making a run in the conference tournament as a fourth seed and losing to Stanford in the first round of the NCAA tournament. With new Head Coach Jennifer Gross at the helm, the Aggies have started the season 8-5 overall and 0-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>After replacing 14-year Head Coach Sandy Simpson, who went 24-9 overall and 10-6 in conference in his final season, new Head Coach Jennifer Gross is trying to bring a fast, up-tempo offense to the team, as well as a tough and physical mentality to both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“Although I am in my first year as the head coach at UC Davis, I have been a part of this Aggie program for the past eight years,” Gross said. “Of course, I have my own style as the head coach, but the overall philosophy of our program will remain the same.”</p>\n<p>This season the Aggies are led by their three senior captains. Senior guard Samantha Meggison started all 33 games last season, leading the team in steals with 61 and finishing second on the team with 66 assists. Meggison is leading the Aggies in points with 10.8 points per game and rebounds (4.5). Senior guard Hana Asano is averaging seven points and 3.5 assists per game. Senior forward Kasey Riecks is second on the team, with 10.2 points per game and is on pace to become the 15th Aggie to reach 1,000 career points.</p>\n<p>“Three of our seniors, Samantha Meggison, Kasey Riecks and Hana Asano have been very consistent so far,” Gross said. “Whether it is scoring, rebounding or getting us stops, they have been providing great leadership and have been very productive on the court.”</p>\n<p>After five straight wins to start the season, the Aggies have cooled off and are now 8-5 and 0-1 in conference. Davis is averaging 62.9 points per game, ranking sixth in the conference in offense, including a league-leading 7.6 threes per game, ranking them 14th in all of Division I. Defensively, they are only giving up 63.6 points to their opponents, forcing 19.9 turnovers a game.</p>\n<p>Gross is focused this year on building strong relations and competing as a unit, fielding a team that can be competitive night in and night out in a very even conference that is up for grabs. The Aggies’ goal for the season is to continue growing throughout the next few months and coming as close as possible to reaching their potential.</p>\n<p>“We have big picture goals like trying to go back to the NCAA tournament,” Riecks said. “But there’s a lot of goals within our team that we want to accomplish through each game, and its getting better every game, and the opportunity that we have to be on the court during practice is amazing.”</p>\n<p><strong>CSUN: Matadors</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team has already seen success this season, sitting at 8-7 overall and 3-0 in the Big West. Last year, the Matadors suffered through a 4-26 overall (4-11 Big West) season. Thus far, Northridge has defeated Irvine, Riverside and Long Beach to stand in first place in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Matadors are led by senior center Jasmine Erving, who averages 14.7 points per game and has started all 15 games so far, alongside freshman guard Ashlee Guay.</p>\n<p>Erving earned herself the Big West Player of the Week award the week of Nov. 28. She posted two consecutive double-doubles against Colgate and West Virginia.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 2, freshman guard Janae Sharpe also took home the Big West Player of the Week award, bringing CSUN women’s basketball its second of the season. Sharpe scored 19 points and had seven steals against UC Irvine, leading Northridge to its first league win of the season.</p>\n<p>In steals, Northridge only ranks behind Long Beach this season, partly due to freshman guard Ashlee Guay, who leads the team with 55. She and Sharpe, who has 29 steals, get the ball back for their offense and feed leading scorer Erving. Both Guay and Sharpe have 57 and 36 assists respectively.</p>\n<p>Northridge will face Pacific on the road and Cal Poly at home before facing Santa Barbara at home on Jan. 21.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton: Titans</strong></p>\n<p>After posting a 6-5 nonconference record, Fullerton has opened its Big West season by going 1-3.</p>\n<p>The Titans lost a close game at Pacific in its Big West opener 72-67, despite a fourth consecutive 20-point effort from senior guard Megan Richardson. Fullerton then upset UC Davis 58-50 two days later, and returned home 1-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>In the team’s home opener, four different Titans tallied double digit points, but Cal Poly won 76-69. On Saturday, Fullerton played host to visiting UCSB, who escaped with a narrow 39-37 victory.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Marcia Foster will be patrolling the sidelines in her third season with Fullerton, who a year after posting a 9-21 (5-11 Big West) overall record, was tabbed to finish fifth in the Conference Preseason Media Poll.</p>\n<p>Richardson was named to the preseason All-Conference team and is the squad’s returning leader in minutes per game (32) and points (14.7). Other returning starters include redshirt senior point guard Lauren Chow and sophomore guard Alex Thomas.</p>\n<p>An indication of Fullerton’s success may be how the team fares away from the friendly confines of Titan Gym. Last year, Fullerton was 3-14 on the road, including 2-6 in the Big West.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43526\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43526\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-13/big-west-conference-womens-basketball-preview/","id":790,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[789,788,787],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take on Huskies at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women’s basketball finishes off a three-game home stand Wednesday against Pac-12 opponent Washington.

As the Gauchos know, having a new coach means adjusting to a whole new system, which can take time.</p>\n<p>“It feels like we’re really coming together and starting to really mesh as a group,” sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We feel really good after those two wins, emphasizing the wins [part].”</p>\n<p>An offensive key for Head Coach Carlene Mitchell has been balanced scoring and not solely relying on senior guard Emilie Johnson. Johnson leads the team with 14.7 points per game, but Nesbit and junior forward Sweets Underwood also average double figures.</p>\n<p>“Anybody on our team can step up any night,” Locke said. “We have to make sure they take good shots in rhythm and just keep executing.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit has made a huge impact in the last two games, averaging 13.5 points. Overall, she leads the team in assists with 3.25 per contest.</p>\n<p>“[Nesbit’s] been a spark off the bench,” Locke said. “She’s able to see the game a bit more, see what’s open, and then been able to come in and execute.”</p>\n<p>Washington’s roster also contains three players averaging at least 12 points per game. The Gauchos will need to be aware of Regina Rogers, their leading scorer at 14.7 points per game and shooting 76 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“We have to get after it and play our team defense,” Locke said. “We need to know the personnel, continue to rebound and give them one shot.”</p>\n<p>Unlike in their first two games on the road, UCSB has jumped out to a quick start in their last two games, taking large leads into halftime.</p>\n<p>The key will be maintaining their consistency in the second half.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be a team that can play both halves, all 40 minutes,” Adrian said. “We need to know that teams are going to keep battling and not just roll over.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/gauchos-huskies-home/","id":817,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[816,815,814],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tears Apart Lions for Second-Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team earned its second consecutive win Saturday afternoon in the Thunderdome against visiting Loyola Marymount 66-49.

With 13:36 remaining, junior forward Sweets Underwood converted a three-point play to bring the lead to 10. But this time the Gauchos never again allowed their opponents to come within the single digits.</p>\n<p>“We’re pushing the ball early,” Mitchell said. “We’re setting the tone on the offensive end by making the other team get back and play transition defense.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 43.8 percent from the field in the first half, compared to LMU’s 23.3 percent.</p>\n<p>The lead continued to blossom for UCSB, and during the second half the lead reached its largest margin at 23 points.</p>\n<p>“We went into it wanting to learn from last game,” junior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “The last game we had, we got a lead early, but we gave it up in the second half, so [this time] we really wanted to stick with it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos out-rebounded the Lions and killed them in second chance points at 21-9.</p>\n<p>“[Rebounding is] something we work every single day on because of our lack of height,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “We’re tired of hearing about it, so we’re going to do something about it and we’re going to rebound.”</p>\n<p>However, turnovers are often the most impressive statistic on the stat sheet — and where the biggest improvements can be made. UCSB turned the ball over nine times in the entire contest while tallying 13 assists.</p>\n<p>While LMU’s star, junior guard Alex Cowling, tallied 22 points on the game, 14 of them came in the second half with the lead firmly under control. Cowling was the only player in double figures for the Lions.</p>\n<p>“[The strategy] was to let her score as many as she could and let nobody else score,” Mitchell said. “She’s a great scorer, but at the end of the day, if you only have one player in double figures, it’s going to be hard for a team to win.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit, Underwood and Johnson were all in double figures for the Gauchos. While Underwood tallied her third double-double of the season, Johnson caught fire in the second half and led the Gauchos offensively with 21 points and four assists, hitting 5-8 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“We know how good we can be when we’re sharp, focused and playing as a team,” Johnson said. “We can’t win a ball game when all our players aren’t at their best. We have to come out and win together.”</p>\n<p>UCSB finishes off its three-game home stand Wednesday against Washington.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/","id":816,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[815,814,813],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Get Around Gaels in First Thunderdome Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It was a tale of two halves for the UCSB women’s basketball team in their home opener last night, though the Gauchos walked away with a 61-52 victory.

UCSB’s high defensive intensity was on display, holding St. Mary’s to just 14 points.</p>\n<p>“We feel like if we put the pressure initially like we did tonight on the defensive end of things that we can have a chance to win games,” Mitchell said. “It was definitely by far the best [defensive effort] in the first three games. They had some great players, but we did a great job on the defensive end.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Gauchos found their stride offensively, shooting 53.8 percent from the field in the first half. With just under three minutes left, the Gauchos had racked up an impressive 28-point lead, the largest lead of the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I think it was just the energy level,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “We were feeding off of each other and we know now how we can [play] because of that run in the first half.”</p>\n<p>The second half told a different story. After halftime, the Gaels continued a 7-0 run that ended the first half and continued to cut into the Gaucho lead, assisted by UCSB fouls. By the eight-minute mark, UCSB was in the penalty. On the game, St. Mary’s converted 21 of their 30 free throws.</p>\n<p>“We have to play [like we did in the first half] for 40 minutes,” Johnson said. “We can’t dip off or have any momentum swings; we need to be in control for 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>A charge by junior center Kirsten Tilleman led to a technical foul by St. Mary’s coach. With just over a minute remaining, the Gaels’ leading scorer and senior guard Jasmine Smith hit a three to bring the lead down to six points. UCSB converted their free throws down the stretch to seal the win.</p>\n<p>“There’s still a lot more to this team and I know we’re going to continue to grow and get better,” Mitchell said. “With that, there should be a lot of wins this year.”</p>\n<p>Turnovers were an issue in Santa Barbara’s first two games and came back to haunt the Gauchos, who committed 16 second-half turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It was just a lack of focus,” Johnson said. “We need to take care of the ball, be strong with it. Some of the turnovers were unforced and some had to do with execution and being there for each other because they were trapping and double teaming.”</p>\n<p>Three UCSB players finished in double figures, including Nesbit who set a new team high with 15 points and provided a big spark off the bench. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig, who propelled the Gauchos offensively in the first half, finished with nine points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals. However, it was truly a concerted effort, as every player who stepped on the court had at least one point.</p>\n<p>“It was a great team effort,” Mitchell said. “I think at different stages of the game there were different players stepping up. We had three players in double figures, which will win us games.”</p>\n<p>UCSB resumes play Saturday against Loyola Marymount. The game will begin at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43096\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43096\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/","id":815,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[814,813,812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Gaels in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a rough start to the season last weekend, UCSB women’s basketball hopes to rebound Thursday in their home opener against St. Mary’s. “We want to get back on the floor,” junior guard Dest...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a rough start to the season last weekend, UCSB women’s basketball hopes to rebound Thursday in their home opener against St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p>“We want to get back on the floor,” junior guard Destini Mason said. “We don’t like having practices in between because we’re trying to get back and get a win.

Against Portland State, 18 turnovers led to 20 Viking points and 17 offensive rebounds led to 13 second chance points.</p>\n<p>“The three things we’ve really been focusing on in practice are rebounding, defense and turnovers,” Mason said. “Hopefully for this next game, we take what we’ve been practicing and apply it to the game because it’s all mental.”</p>\n<p>A highlight of the weekend was the play of junior forward Sweets Underwood, who averaged a double-double and is leading the Gauchos with 13 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We expect that from Sweets,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Sky’s the limit [for her]. She should have a double-double every night.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will key in on two Gaels while on the court: senior Jasmine Smith and sophomore Jackie Nared. In their first two games, the two guards averaged 14.5 points and 13 points, respectively. Nared is also averaging seven rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“Smith was a first team all-conference player [last year],” Mitchell said. “We’re going to have to do a great job with both of them on the perimeter.”</p>\n<p>Last year UCSB played St. Mary’s on the road, which resulted in a 77-53 loss.</p>\n<p>“They’re a good team and they have to be very confident in the fact that they beat the Gauchos pretty handily at their place last year,” Mitchell said. “Our kids know that they can’t see uniforms. We have to walk in here and act like we’re playing the number one team in the country.”</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s arrives at the Thunderdome at 1-1, coming off a close victory against Montana. However, Mitchell expects nothing but a win.</p>\n<p>“I want them to go in expecting to win,” Mitchell said. “If we do the little things, we should expect to win. That’s my mentality. If we’re playing Connecticut tomorrow, I expect to win.”</p>\n<p>In the preseason polls, UCSB was expected to finish second in the Big West behind Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Tip off is set for tonight at 6.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43020\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-17/gauchos-face-gaels-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43020\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-17/gauchos-face-gaels-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-17/gauchos-face-gaels-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-17/gauchos-face-gaels-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-17/gauchos-face-gaels-home-opener/","id":812,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[811,810,809],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes Winless in Road Openers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Beginning their season on the road, the UCSB women’s basketball team dropped their first two games 60-55 to Seattle and 65-51 to Portland State. “Obviously it’s disappointing,” senior guard Em...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Untitled-34.jpg?resize=128%2C227\" alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"227\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Beginning their season on the road, the UCSB women’s basketball team dropped their first two games 60-55 to Seattle and 65-51 to Portland State.</p>\n<p>“Obviously it’s disappointing,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “We’re not content being 0-2, but we’re going to keep fighting and keep improving.

We have to find a better way to start.”</p>\n<p>Turnovers plagued UCSB, as the team committed 18 turnovers, leading to 20 Viking points. Portland also grabbed 17 offensive rebounds which led to 13 second chance points.</p>\n<p>“We got out-rebounded and I think that’s what hurt us,” junior forward Sweets Underwood said. “We gave Portland too many second chances. We struggled to box out their bigs.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ leading scorer, Johnson, struggled offensively, shooting just 2-12 for four points. However, Underwood stepped up to tally 12 points and five rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I can’t expect Emilie to score 20 to 30 points every night,” Mitchell said. “There are going to be times when she needs to run the show, but at the same time other perimeter players will need to step up and carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>In Mitchell’s first official game against Seattle, UCSB trailed by 11 before pulling within three with half a minute remaining. Johnson and sophomore guard Melissa Zornig both had opportunities to tie, but both were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>“We had the shots at the end, but the more important plays are the ones that put us at that point,” Johnson said. “Kelsey hit a big three to cut the lead and they missed some free throws. We were playing from behind, though, so we need to make those plays earlier so that we’re ahead instead.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos failed to find an answer for senior Talisa Rhea, who came up with big shots to keep the Gauchos in check. The 5’11’’ guard finished with 20 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“She’s a great overall player,” Mitchell said. “It’s not like she’s just a shooter. If we went back we’d play her with a box and one.”</p>\n<p>Johnson also tallied 20 points to lead the Gauchos, and Underwood contributed 14 points and a career-high 15 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets is] playing up to her potential,” Johnson said. “I really enjoy playing alongside her. She’s so aggressive. She can average a double-double this year.”</p>\n<p>The differences in the game for UCSB may have been points in the paint and second chance opportunities, where they were outscored 30-16 and 14-4, respectively. The Redhawks also led the Gauchos in assists with 16-7.</p>\n<p>“The rebounding is very disturbing on my end,” Mitchell said. “We can’t be out-rebounded because we’re oversized.
