Now, with COVID-19, housing insecurity is an even scarier reality. The shelter-in-place and safer-at-home orders will not keep us safe if we cannot stay housed. And to put it simply, the UC is as unreliable an employer as they are a landlord. Outgoing UC President Janet Napolitano recently pledged that </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-02/uc-states-third-largest-employer-commits-to-no-coronavirus-related-layoffs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the UC would not lay off any career employees due to COVID-19 through June 30, 2020</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Owning a home is far out of reach. And, if you lose your home, trying to get rehoused is next to impossible. The ripple effects and subsequent waves of COVID-19 add even greater levels of uncertainty to our members’ lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For workers living off campus, </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xzUqh4-C-qK1Mem8f1chFQCZzl6qqc5CofSq3f30unc/edit?usp=sharing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skyrocketing rent and housing prices have already pushed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> them further and further away from their workplaces and put them in situations of housing and food insecurity. Layoffs or reductions in pay would force impossible choices between maintaining adequate housing or maintaining adequate nutrition for our members and their families.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time of crisis, mutual aid is a form of organizing. One of our members helped create and distribute care packs to neighbors with masks, gloves, tenants rights pamphlets and Zoom call details for weekly tenants associations meetings. Several of our statewide unions have formed housing committees and are taking action by calling legislators to demand rent and mortgage cancellation throughout the crisis. We are meeting regularly and sharing resources on eviction moratoriums and renters’ rights.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California’s public universities are essential to the health of our communities and to the economic recovery of our state. As part of the statewide housing rights movement, we recognize that the University of California, as the largest public employer in the state, has enormous power to limit the harm of future layoffs and help ensure we remain housed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mass layoffs in the middle of the most severe pandemic and economic recession of the last century would surely leave UC workers and their families unable to pay rent in some of the most unaffordable housing markets in the country. We have a responsibility to each other, especially now, and the president of the UC and UC Regents have a responsibility to the thousands of workers who ensure the university continues to run.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following organizations have worked to draft this letter to the editor: AFSCME 3299, Committee of Interns and Residents, California Nurses Association, Teamsters Local 2010, UAW 2865, UAW 5810, UC-AFT, and UPTE-CWA 9119.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94663\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-27/letter-to-the-editor-uc-labor-unions-are-fighting-for-housing-rights-during-global-pandemic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94663\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-27/letter-to-the-editor-uc-labor-unions-are-fighting-for-housing-rights-during-global-pandemic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-27/letter-to-the-editor-uc-labor-unions-are-fighting-for-housing-rights-during-global-pandemic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-27/letter-to-the-editor-uc-labor-unions-are-fighting-for-housing-rights-during-global-pandemic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-27/letter-to-the-editor-uc-labor-unions-are-fighting-for-housing-rights-during-global-pandemic/","id":6472,"author":{"id":808,"name":"Letter to the Editor"},"related":[6471,6470,6469],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/808"}},"__N_SSG":true}
