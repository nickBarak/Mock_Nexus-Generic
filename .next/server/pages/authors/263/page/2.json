April 18, 1:57 a.m. — Deputies responded to a call on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Rd. of someone throwing eggs off a balcony at nearby cars and passersby.</p>\n<p>When officers arrived, they noted a car dripping with egg yolk just as they were welcomed by a descending egg. The 20-year-old male throwing the eggs darted inside the apartment complex as officers ran up the steps. The cops banged on the door until the resident egg-thrower finally opened up.</p>\n<p>“I’m being arrested for throwing chicken at people in the roadway, it’s just chicken, smell my fingers and my breath, this is bullshit,” he announced to the officers.</p>\n<p>After pointing out a completely empty 18-pack of extra large eggs, he continued, “I bought these eggs at the store, I can own eggs.” Officers searched the roadway for chicken or chicken bones. None were found.</p>\n<p>After blaming his escapades on “another dude,” the 20 year old refused to speak further. He was arrested and booked at Santa Barbara County Jail for his “fowl play.”</p>\n<p>The Fightin’ Freshman<br>\nSun. April 18, 12:59 a.m. — Officers responded to a call of an unconscious subject on the 6500 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<p>The male, who was supported by two friends, proved easy to spot. When the cops called out to the inebriated trio, one of the supporters nudged his friend in an effort to elicit a response but instead only caused him to fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>The officers called the paramedics before noticing the smell of alcohol wafting around a 19-year-old resident of the San Miguel Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>When a group of seven males emerged from a nearby frat house to watch the scene, the beer-soaked freshman called out, “Yeah, it’s none of your business, fuck you! Why don’t you go back inside!”</p>\n<p>The freshman and the frat boys began to exchange some heated words. The officer then told the drunken teenager he had two options — leave immediately or face arrest. Apparently looking for a fight, the first-year responded to the request by pushing the officer in the chest and shouting, “Don’t fucking touch me!”</p>\n<p>“Fuck you! Come on, do you want to go?” he asked the officer. And go they did. The deputy told the man that he was under arrest before wrestling him to the ground and handcuffing him.</p>\n<p>After hearing his Miranda rights, the forgetful freshie explained he did nothing wrong and denied any aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>In response to his arrest, he noted, “I’ve been through this before, you guys aren’t shit!”</p>\n<p>The feisty freshman was transported to Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/","id":3834,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3833,3832,3831],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2006-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Allergic Reaction in Action\nSaturday, Oct. 21, 11:04 p.m. - Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers were biking northbound on Camino del Sur when they saw a man lying on the ground at a bus stop.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Allergic Reaction in Action<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 21, 11:04 p.m. – Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers were biking northbound on Camino del Sur when they saw a man lying on the ground at a bus stop.</p>\n<p>Two unidentified people were attempting to wake up and help the 18-year-old University of Southern California student who was face-down in a pool of spaghetti-vomit.</p>\n<p>A deputy approached the man – who suddenly woke up – and began questioning him.

The woman replied that she lived in the Santa Rosa Residence Hall, then corrected herself, saying she lived at the Pi Beta Phi sorority house.</p>\n<p>The officer noticed that the woman reeked of alcohol and could not maintain her balance, so he arrested her for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>As the deputy placed the woman under arrest, she whispered, “If you un-arrest me, I will give you $10,000.”</p>\n<p>Because bribery is frowned upon by the police force, the woman’s offer was rejected, and she was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Age-Blinded By Love<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 7, 12:15 a.m. – Deputies walking down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were alerted to a group of five people standing in a parking lot drinking beer.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as a man, who was holding a can of Steel Reserve 211, hand the drink to a woman, who knocked the beer back.</p>\n<p>A deputy approached the woman, removed her from the crowd, and began questioning her. The woman said she was 17, but later admitted that she was only 16. The officer issued her a minor in possession citation, and let her go.</p>\n<p>The officer then turned his attention to the man and asked him how old he was. The man said he was 23 years old.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the man why he gave the woman alcohol, to which the man replied, “Because this is I.V.”</p>\n<p>After the subject admitted that the woman did not look 21 years old, the officer asked him why he would provide her with alcohol outside, in front of patrolling deputies.</p>\n<p>The man eloquently replied, “She asked me for a drink, and I was like, OK.”</p>\n<p>When the officer informed the man that the woman was 16, he stupidly responded, “That’s bad.”</p>\n<p>It got worse when the police officer cited the man for furnishing alcohol to a minor, which incurs a minimum fine of $250.</p>\n<p>Who Got Pinocchio Drunk?<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 7, 12:34 a.m. – While patrolling at the corner of Camino del Sur and Trigo Road, Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers observed a woman walking northbound down the street.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old woman was staggering all over the road, unable to keep her balance, when she saw the group of deputies. She then turned around and stumbled back the way she came.</p>\n<p>An officer stopped the woman and asked her if she was all right because she showed signs of intoxication, including the strong smell of a fruity alcohol.</p>\n<p>The subject told the officer that she was “OK” and said she was just walking with her boyfriend.

Fearing for the woman’s safety, an officer detained the man and began questioning him.</p>\n<p>The man was aggravated and began yelling that the officer was harassing him. The officer tried to ask the subject why he refused to leave the woman alone, but the man only responded by calling the officer a “douche bag” and saying he was not intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The subject’s friends urged the man to behave, but he went on a rant, and said he wished the deputy would lose his job, and demanded his badge number.</p>\n<p>The man was obviously wasted, and was placed under arrest for public intoxication.

When officers arrived at the scene, they found two men walking in the median toward Francisco Torres, hitting road signs with poles.

The vehicle was stopped for questioning and officers discovered that stereo equipment was being illegally sold out of the vehicle without a permit.</p>\n<p>While the entrepreneurs were being warned about the possible consequences of their illegal sales, the officers noticed a marijuana pipe in plain view on the center console of the car. A search of the vehicle revealed the driver to be in possession of marijuana and a suspended license.</p>\n<p>Officers seized the marijuana and the driver of the vehicle was cited for driving with a suspended license, driving without a seat belt and possession of marijuana. </p>\n<p>– Compiled by Lindsey Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-7967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-7967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/","id":2856,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[2855,2854,2853],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/263"}},"__N_SSG":true}
