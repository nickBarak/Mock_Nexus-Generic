Emergency Loan program during last night’s final meeting before government turnovers.</p>\n<p>The council officially placed the newly created UCSB Community Financial Fund — a student loan program approved as a new fee during this year’s Spring Elections — into the association’s by-laws. Additionally, the council approved a request of $459 to fund a week-long advertisement in the Santa Barbara Independent publicizing the May 26 event “The Alternative: Bringing Power to Our Voices,” which will take place during College Republicans’  David Horowitz lecture.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the event aims to appease students concerned about the controversial message behind Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>“He has decades of experience of twisting your words and forcing you to say something,” Tzankov said. “It’s just not a healthy space for dialogue. We didn’t want to work in his space but created an alternative event where we will have a healthy space for dialogue.”</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joe Lee, however, said scheduling the speeches at separate times would allow students to attend both lectures and provide more balanced arguments.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be effective if you see the event first and have a reactive event to that,” Lee said. “We don’t know what’s going to be happening there. Maybe if you have it before or after, students who are attending David Horowitz will have an opportunity to attend this event.”</p>\n<p>Despite Lee’s suggestion the forum was not rescheduled and is slated to take place during Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>The council also discussed a Bill to Restructure Queer Commission that proposed additional unfunded positions on the committee to further gender education efforts on campus.</p>\n<p>University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid said the legislation would provide vital resources to ensure equality on campus.</p>\n<p>“We created the first Queer Alumni Network, which is a branch of the Alumni Association, specifically for queer alumni,” Del Cid said. “We’re just making sure that’s established and institutionalized within the positions so it can sustain itself. This also creates a position for transfer students as a way for someone who’s new to the community to get involved.”</p>\n<p>However, a significant amount of debate arose over the intricacies of the bill’s language including references to the gender identity “genderfuck.”</p>\n<p>As of press time, the council tabled the bill until after discussions on old business, leaving the genderfuck issue unresolved.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38464\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38464\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/","id":3136,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3135,3134,3133],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Council Meets Controversy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council spent the majority of last night’s meeting discussing funding for College Republicans’ proposal to bring controversial speaker David Horowitz to campus.

Finance Board meeting, College Republicans requested that Legislative Council reopen the board’s minutes and allocate $1,770 for the event’s audio-visual, recording and security costs. Horowitz, a noted conservative activist and writer, last visited campus in April 2008 shortly after accusing UCSB’s Muslim Student Association of having political ties with al-Qaeda. Although several members of the Muslim Student Association and general campus community attended the meeting in protest of the group’s request, the council eventually approved $800 to the organization.</p>\n<p>As of press time, the council remained in session pending the approval of the A.S. 2011-2012 budget, which faces significant cuts.</p>\n<p>President of College Republicans Steven Begakis requested $1,770 for security, audiovisual technology and visual recording for the proposed event. Begakis said the council should allocate funds on the basis of freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>“We just want to bring a conservative speaker to represent our minority opinion and promote a diversity of ideas,” Begakis said.</p>\n<p>Sophia Armen, a second-year political science and feminist studies major, said the board’s eventual decision to even partially fund the event reflected poorly on the student government.</p>\n<p>“Our association does not look good right now in the eyes of the average student,” Armen said. “I just want you to understand … what isolating communities really means. You’d better have communities on this campus’ back, because it’s your job. Not just because it’s your job — because it’s your moral responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Andres Rey, a second-year political science major, said denying funding for the event would be a violation of a citizen’s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>“That’s freedom of speech: the ability for you to speak,” Rey said. “I think it’s a very important step that the council approves the security for funding because you are denying the vehicle for someone to speak.”</p>\n<p>While On-Campus Representative Danielle Stevens objected that Horowitz’s views transcended the divide between free speech and hate speech, Rey said the speaker’s words are not inflammatory enough to be censored by the association.</p>\n<p>“The definition of hate speech … it has to be directly linked to a violent act,” Rey said. “You have to prove it incites direct acts of hatred and I think that’s something you can’t prove.”</p>\n<p>However, College Republicans Vice President Matt Borasi said the campus has the duty of providing students a space where all voices can be heard.</p>\n<p>“Do I agree with everything that Daniel Horowitz said? No,” Borasi said. “What I do agree with is the open forum the university stands for.”</p>\n<p>Muslim Student Association member Ahmed Naguib, however, said the Muslim community is underrepresented on campus and is unwilling to tolerate further discrimination.</p>\n<p>“There’s 200 or 300 of us on campus. We really fly under the radar,” Naguib said. “But, believe it or not, this is something that really affects us.”</p>\n<p>Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht said the board declined to allocate any funds to College Republicans on Monday as, according to A.S. Legal Code, the association cannot deny funding to events on the basis of offensive content.</p>\n<p>“You need to base this not on the context of the event but on the event itself,” Lieberknecht said. “You really need to look at the policies and procedures of what can and can’t be funded.”</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President Jake Elwood, California state law requires that the UC Regents not deny funding to events based on their content.</p>\n<p>“If we pass the finance board minutes,” Elwood said, “we will be sued by David Horowitz.”</p>\n<p>On April 14, 2008, the Daily Nexus printed an advertisement paid for by the Horowitz Freedom Center, advocating against the Muslim Students Association and accusing it of being a “Campus Front Group For Jihad.”</p>\n<p>“The MSA is a radical political group that was founded by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the godfather of al Qaeda and Hamas, to bring the jihad into the heart of American higher education,” the ad read.</p>\n<p>Nick Dürnhöfer, editor in chief of the Nexus in 2008, said the editorial section of the newspaper cannot execute agency over the advertising section.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t see that ad before it ran in the Nexus — I don’t see any ad that goes in there,” Dürnhöfer said. “I’m not going to let a newspaper get biased in that way by picking and choosing advertisers … When you start thinking that way, you can’t really do you job as an editor.”</p>\n<p>Following a lengthy debate, the board swiftly approved a motion to allocate $1,100 for the event. However, according to Stryker, confusion arose among the representatives as to what the motion they passed entailed as it followed a string of stipulations and modifications.</p>\n<p>“When the amendment is friendly with the person that made the original motion, then that amendment becomes the new motion,” Stryker said. “So when we passed it, we passed that motion. I guess a few got confused and thought we just passed that motion. People that wanted to vote didn’t understand what was going on and thought it was just to pass that amendment.”</p>\n<p>The result was met with outrage from the audience, as individuals shouted “You are sponsoring Islamophobia and racism on this campus,” and “Who on this board is representing the Muslim community?”</p>\n<p>Considering the murky circumstances under which the resolution had been passed, the council moved to amend the allotted amount to $732, providing funding for only police officers.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joseph Lee said the council was overstepping in bounds by reopening the discussion.</p>\n<p>“What happened to the whole point of transparency of this council?” Lee said. “We’re already not doing our jobs and paying attention to what’s going on and just because we admitted to making a mistake that doesn’t mean we get to reconsider something we all passed through consent.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually modified the amount to $800.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lee presented an apology for his recent incarceration. He spent five days in Santa Barbara County jail in relation to a stolen laptop and, after pleading not guilty at his arraignment on Tuesday, is set to appear in court on May 18.</p>\n<p>“My mistakes have brought disappointment and frustration to both my student constituents and my peers,” Lee said. “I am ashamed and I fully regret this situation.”</p>\n<p>Lee said he felt the incident was isolated within his personal life and would not affect his ability to perform his job.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to do my best to continue to perform to the best of my best in leg council to the students that represented me,” Lee said. “This matter solely matters to me.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37861\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37861\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/","id":3134,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3133,3132,3131],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Accused A.S.

Lee, a second-year political science major, was detained in connection with a theft that occurred on April 19 at Santa Catalina residence hall and faces charges of felony burglary, unauthorized altering of computer data system, receiving stolen property and grand theft.</p>\n<p>The decision to plea not guilty was largely a strategic measure, Lee said.</p>\n<p>“It was recommended by my attorney,” Lee said. “It was basically to postpone the preliminary hearing.”</p>\n<p>Despite the controversy, Lee said he will continue to serve as a student body representative — starting at today’s 5 p.m. A.S. Legislative Council meeting.</p>\n<p>“I will be performing my job for the rest of this quarter,” Lee said. “For this year at least, I will continue to represent the students as best as possible.”</p>\n<p>According to Lee, there is no connection between his elected office and the criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a personal matter,” Lee said. “I believe there’s a boundary between this and my Legislative Council position.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Code, Legislative council members must “remember that they are elected to the ASUCSB Legislative Council for the sole purpose of serving students and  shall  during  Legislative  Council  meetings,  show  the  highest  degree  of respect, regard and decency to their fellow students.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Jake Elwood, who oversees A.S.

Additionally, the council discussed the Halloween parking situation and funded the upcoming Students of Color Conference.</p>\n<p>Although council members have hotly contended the request to form the new BCC over the past months, they decided it was a worthy addition to the association. Representative-at-Large Javier Martinez said the coalition’s ideals are aligned with those of A.S. and the University of California.</p>\n<p>“It continues in the tradition of the association’s activism and it’s about education,” Martinez said. “If we want to be the progressive campus we claim we are, this would be a step in that direction.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez said the bill was strongly supported by students, so representatives could do no better than respect constituents’ wishes.</p>\n<p>“These students came to us because they have a vision and wanted to make a difference on campus,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “I wouldn’t want to be part of a group that doesn’t let students contribute what they want to the campus.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council allocated the SOCC one-fourth of its special projects budget for the full year, equal to $4,284. On-campus Representative Joe Lee said such significant funding was warranted as the event will not only draw 1,000 attendees from across the state but also greatly empower the campus as a whole.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a good way for legislative council to represent the student body, considering the large amount of hate crimes recently [reported] in our community,” Lee said. “That is something that we as A.S. should be concerned about.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council discussed Halloween parking. According to Student Advocate General Harrison Weber, students with a night and weekend pass from UCSB Transportation &amp; Parking Services will face a two-hour time gap during which the permits will not be valid. He said this raises not only logistical issues but greater problems within the parking system as well.</p>\n<p>“At a public forum last week, we asked if they could suspend the ban for a few hours and they said that was cool,” Weber said. “But apparently outside of the forum, that was not cool. We could all get a temporary pass or drive around for a few hours, but I think the principle that they can say something to our faces then go back on it is more important.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28482\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28482\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/","id":3150,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3149,3148,3147],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Political Events Spur Debate of Fund Allocation","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Legislative Council discussed the context of a recent A.S.

Finance Board allocation during last night’s three-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>The council conferred about the 1993 Smith v. Regents court case, which prohibited the use of student fees in lobbying for any particular political proposition or candidate. With that in mind, the A.S. Finance Board decided not to fund CalPIRG’s “Vote Float” parade during last Monday’s meeting for fear that the organization might align itself to a certain politician or cause.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, the aforementioned legislation strictly regulates the manner in which college student governments can regulate funds.</p>\n<p>“It has been a requirement for elected students to ensure that they don’t support a candidate,” Marquez said. “You all receive honoraria so we can’t endorse candidates for that reason. Individuals in their own name can make an opinion about something, but they aren’t allowed to attach it to their office.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council debated whether T-shirts produced with student funds should be manufactured by a single company in order to establish a standard rate and save money for A.S. in the long run.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Jamie Silverstein said the council’s budget gives representatives no choice but to lower its expectations for T-shirts they commission.</p>\n<p>“We need to be sure T-shirts are made in an environmentally aware manner and ensure that they will be cost effective, but these two things go in different directions,” Silverstein said. “The group needs to decide if they want cheap prices or environmentally made T-shirts. The group needs to decide what they want out of their T-shirts.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-campus Representative Jason Lopez said A.S. shouldn’t limit student organizations’ options by binding them to one shirt manufacturer.</p>\n<p>“A lot of groups on campus already have a partnership with different companies,” Lopez said. “They may already get cheaper prices there and if we make them go somewhere else we might make them spend more money than they would have otherwise.”</p>\n<p>The board eventually tabled the discussion.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Chloe Stryker said she was concerned that A.S. Finance Board is likely to run out of funds for the quarter.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to do,” Stryker said. “We could take away from winter [quarter’s unallocated fund] or just give away all our money in the next two meetings. If you know people that have events in Fall Quarter, have them come in as soon as possible because it’s going to become difficult to fund those groups.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27838\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27838\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/","id":3148,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3147,3146,3145],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

While many board members thought the addition would fill a current void in A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions, others felt another branch would add unneeded stress to current student government infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Chloe Stryker, who authored the bill, said the movement was practically retroactive.</p>\n<p>“I think HRC should have been a BCC to begin with,” Stryker said. “An OSL is very specific and this group is very broad. Also, obviously if they were working as an OSL, they wouldn’t have come to us. How does it look if A.S. is turning hundreds of students trying to build a coalition away?”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said the absence of such an organization within the institution reflects poorly on the student body as a whole.</p>\n<p>“It has to do with the way we are represented as a campus to our state, to our nation, to anyone who looks at the UC — they will look at our A.S.,” Mayorga said. “At this point, human rights aren’t even being addressed in our own student government.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis, on the other hand, said the association doesn’t have the funds to support a new board.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important to establish that the vote isn’t upon how necessary human rights are,” Lewis said. “It’s one of the most noble causes you can have in a BCC. But as A.S., we also represent the students and right now we’re in the recessionary period and other BCCs aren’t doing so well.”</p>\n<p>The council ultimately shot down the bill with a 13–9–1 vote.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council decided to take a stance against hate crimes towards the queer community.</p>\n<p>University Owned Off-Campus Housing Representative Alfredo del Cid cited a measure he had written in response to a recent rise in suicide rates amongst queer youth.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the language we use has no intent, but does send bad messages — such as saying, ‘that’s gay,’” del Cid said. “That has recently driven nine young people to death. I’m asking that we pass this, but also take a moment to reflect on what we do and say.”</p>\n<p>Lastly, the board approved a piece of legislation to support today’s Day of Action — a rally in defense of public education.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important for us to show our support for this,” Representative-at-Large Jasmin Esparza said. “We need to stand by our students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26960\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26960\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/","id":3149,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3148,3147,3146],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leg.

Despite having allotted Transportation &amp; Parking Services a $3.33 lock-in fee at the end of last year, the department has recently increased the price of permits.</p>\n<p>In addition to the paying the quarterly lock-in, A.S. Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said students are now expected to contribute an additional $17.50 per quarter to guarantee free night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>“We have to decide where we want to move forward with it,” Elwood said.</p>\n<p>Following a drawn-out discussion, the board decided to form an ad hoc committee to further investigate the matter.</p>\n<p>“What kind of message does this send to parking services if we give in to their demands?” Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said. “Certain questions need to be answered by PTS before we move forward with this discussion.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the board passed a resolution supporting the federal Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, which seeks to provide immigrants greater access to higher education.</p>\n<p>Alfredo del Cid, university owned off-campus housing representative, said it was A.S.’s duty to speak on behalf of those students who pay student fees, but are denied access to financial aid and other services — a problem which the federal bill will address.</p>\n<p>“These undocumented students are part of our university and the people we represent,” del Cid said. “We’re losing them every day because they just can’t afford to keep paying into the system.”</p>\n<p>Board members were unsure about how their resolution would support the legislation, but the council eventually approved the action.</p>\n<p>Nayra Pacheco, a third-year environmental studies and history of public policy major, said the bill’s main purpose is to establish solidarity between students of all backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“Basically, it allows us to say our student government is behind us and supports the D.R.E.A.M. Act,” Pacheco said. “It helps a lot to have your backing, especially if we need posters or other campaign materials. It’s good to have that backing when we go to Finance Board.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/","id":3162,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3161,3160,3159],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/211"}},"__N_SSG":true}
