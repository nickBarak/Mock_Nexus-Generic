Sure, everyone has heard songs like “Monster Mash” and “Spooky Scary Skeletons,” and anyone who hasn’t listened to “Thriller” at least once in their lifetime has most likely been living under a rock for the past 30 years. This is a list featuring seven spooky songs you may not have heard before — or, if you have, maybe you never thought to listen to them on Halloween: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Walking On Air” by Kerli</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With its soft trilling notes and eerie imagery, this song has an undeniably creepy air to it. While the chorus is surprisingly catchy and upbeat, the song still manages to maintain an overall ghostly tone throughout, making it perfect for a Halloween playlist. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXMeZwO2qZ0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Creepy Doll” by Jonathan Coulton</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Jonathan Coulton is perhaps better known for writing songs featured in video games (such as “Still Alive” from Portal), but he has written stand-alone songs as well. Most of his songs (if not all of them) seem a little offbeat, but “Creepy Doll” takes the cake when it comes to spooky tunes. His lyrics, set against a chilling melody, tell an unsettling horror story as if you’re the one living it, making it a great choice if you want to curl up in bed with your headphones on a gloomy autumn night. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiEarqIBsdg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Stop, I’m Already Dead” by Deadboy and the Elephantmen</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There’s not much more to this song than a competent electric guitar and the lyrics “I am already dead” and yet, that’s all it really needs. This is a melody that manages to be morbid but fun at the same time. You can enjoy the song year-round, but with its death-centric title and chorus, it feels especially appropriate for Halloween </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E73IQx21DEo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Bloody Mary” by Lady Gaga: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an alias like Mother Monster, it should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga came up with some spooky songs of her own. The way she screams between verses and the way her voice becomes distorted during certain lines gives “Bloody Mary” a disturbing resonance. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFwmKL5OL-Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“King” by The Romanovs</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “King” is a siren’s song, telling the tale of a woman who lures men to their death. The melody is accompanied by a haunting harmony, and the song’s steady lilt overall proves beautiful yet macabre, a good fit for a grim holiday. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P911lpDWjp8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Seven Devils” by Florence + the</b> <b>Machine</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With lines like “I was dead when I woke up this morning” and “I’ll be dead before the day is done,” this song is undoubtedly chilling. Its slow, dramatic melody adds to the grim mood, as the lyrics paint a picture of someone being hunted down relentlessly. This song may not be the best at parties, but it’s an appropriately dark tune to listen to if you’re putting the finishing touches on your costume or carving a big smile into a pumpkin. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QdpCJIyyi4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Dead Fast Rap” by Boyinaband</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This fast-paced rap is short, sweet and to the point, as it finds as many ways as possible to use the word “dead” in under two minutes. The song uses clever plays-on-words while consistently clinging to a Halloween-appropriate theme of murder and death. The lyrics, seemingly from the perspective of a serial killer, are paired with an eerie beat that ties the whole thing together and makes it ideal for fall festivities. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQ0dmeCKExg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a shadow of a doubt, there is a wide variety of spooky, scary Halloween-themed songs out there for you to enjoy. Hopefully, these creepy selections can help you get in a festive mood as you prepare for the spookiest night of the year.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/","id":6680,"author":{"id":697,"name":"Phoebe Morales"},"related":[6679,6678,6677],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/697"}},"__N_SSG":true}
