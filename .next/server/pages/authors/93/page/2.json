She’s registered over 800 wins, has been with the women’s program since it started and has done color commentary for ESPN. Her nickname is “The Queen,” for God’s sake. Basically, she’s far too qualified to teach me how to play this sport. So far, she’s given me the biggest physical challenge of the three coaches. Those backline-to-net shuffles are killers. But she’s also the loudest, funniest and most charismatic teacher so far. She jokingly yelled at a kid the other day and he looked like he was going to cry. Awesome. Plus volleyball is made for tall people, and I’m tall. No worries here.</p>\n<p><strong>Mircea Badulescu – Elementary Soccer</strong></p>\n<p>A childhood full of golf gave me hand-eye coordination. Foot-eye, not so much. I am also not much of a runner despite my gazelle strides, nor am I very agile. On top of that, this class consists of nothing but playing soccer. No drills, no pointers, just the game. Badulescu seems cool enough, but I don’t anticipate much interaction because he observes rather than teaches. That being said, he has a cool accent, which is a big plus. The wildcard in the bunch, to say the least.</p>\n<p><strong>Charlotte Scatliffe – Intermediate Tennis</strong></p>\n<p>The first ESS class I took at UCSB was beginning tennis. I had no prior skills, but that class was such a fun experience that I decided to take another. Plus, probably due to the hand-eye coordination thing, I had a little bit of a knack for it. That being said, tennis is hard. There’s a lot of stopping and starting again and turning and starting involved. Don’t even get me started on the serves. Scatliffe is the current assistant coach for women’s tennis, and was a player herself from 2004 to 2008. She has youth on her side, which is good in a teacher. We play fun games, she’s already developed a rapport with some kids and is very personable. Spunky, even. But … tennis is hard, man.</p>\n<p>So that’s the rundown. One week in, and I like to think I already feel a little better. Eating ice cream for dinner and downing my fair share of pitchers at Gio’s can’t be helping, but I’m committed to this.

The results were immediate. In his first game ever as head coach, he took a 2-0 win over conference rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“He immediately turned things around,” UCSB Assistant Athletics Director Bill Mahoney said. “It was pretty amazing. His teams bring the same intensity to the field that he brings as a coach on an everyday basis. He recruited better players, compiled a really good coaching staff and it was night and day. Everything. You could tell that the players believed in themselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB won 13 games in 1999 — only the third time the team had met that win total in the school’s program’s 33-year history. When he arrived, Vom Steeg set a goal of five years before the team would be competing for a National Championship. Sure enough, by 2004, he was at the helm of the best team he had ever coached, poised to make some noise in the NCAA playoffs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the squad lost the College Cup championship game to Indiana in penalty kicks after dominating possession and shot numbers through regulation.</p>\n<p>“Someone tell me that we lost,” Vom Steeg told the press after the game. “It’s disappointing because I thought we played so well. Not in my wildest dreams did I think we could play that well against that team over the course of 110 minutes, so I thought it was a great performance.”</p>\n<p>Two years later, the team would still be reeling, opening the 2006 season with a 7-6 record midway through the 2006 season. Before Vom Steeg, the team would have rolled over and given up on a season going nowhere. For those Gauchos, though, giving up was not an option.</p>\n<p>“They decided as a group that they didn’t want their careers to end, so the players decided we were going to do something different,” Vom Steeg explained. “We just started playing better, and we eventually caught fire.”</p>\n<p>UCSB rode that heat all the way to 11 wins in 12 games, including six in a row on the way to a second national championship appearance. This time, they took down UCLA 2-1 for the program’s first College Cup victory.</p>\n<p>“It was more than just a win,” defender Andy Iro, who currently plays for the Columbus Crew in the MLS, told the Daily Nexus after the match. “A lot of guys and coaches came through here and this is a culmination of all of this.”</p>\n<p>Since 2007, UCSB has led the nation in attendance every year, including setting an all-time record for an on-campus site when 15,896 Gaucho faithfuls attended a match against the Bruins this season.</p>\n<p>With wins in that match, as well as against Duke, both in front of national television cameras, the 2010 team looked ready to pick up the intensity again, with a chance to play a championship game in front of the largest home crowd in the country. Like the 2006 team, Vom Steeg’s group faced a less than ideal start.</p>\n<p>“Any time you start at 0-2-2, you can self-destruct and doubt yourself,” Vom Steeg said. “But we believed we were destined to do other things.”</p>\n<p>Again, the team recovered, managing to finish the regular season 12-4-3. In the first round of the NCAAs, the team cruised to a first-round win over Denver before falling to UC Berkeley in overtime. In the 24th minute of regulation, a controversial red card called against junior midfielder Luis Silva brought the Gauchos a man down for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p>“It’s been very difficult on the coaching staff, on the players and difficult certainly for a lot of our fans,” Vom Steeg said of the early exit. “When things like this happen, all you can really do is channel that energy into your team, into helping your players. Any time negative things happen, it brings your group closer together.”</p>\n<p>After losing just three seniors, UCSB is already looking ahead to next year.</p>\n<p>“If anything, this is a team that I wouldn’t want to play next year,” Vom Steeg said. “We are unbelievably motivated. I think this is as motivated a group as you’re going to get.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/","id":1297,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1296,1295,1294],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One Blown Call, All Hopes Dashed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"That, my friends, is a punch.\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Video courtesy of Youtube user BigMikeUCSB:<br>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0sHhk1DUpyw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>That, my friends, is a punch.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Gaucho soccer lost a second round NCAA playoff match to UC Berkeley, 2-1. But the story goes deeper than that. The match was mired in controversy for both teams, and volunteer Head Referee Mike Kampmeinert, a Folsom, Calif. Native, broke any ref’s golden rule by taking the game into his own hands. Regardless of the outcome, Sunday’s game highlights the issue of inconsistent officiating in college soccer, and something needs to be done about it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Here’s what I saw, and what the rest of the video shows in part: Gaucho midfielder Luis Silva comes in with an aggressive slide-tackle on the ball around the feet of UC Berkeley’s Servando Carrasco. After losing control of the ball, Carrasco shove-punches Silva above the neck and Silva goes down. Carrasco goes down as well, and both players are awarded cards. This is where the problems begin.</p>\n<p>Did Silva deserve a red card for the play? I don’t claim to know much about college soccer and the intricacies of its rules, but he certainly made a hard, physical play on the ball and it’s understandable for Carrasco to be angry in what was a heated match for both teams. But the red card forced UCSB to close out the next 75 minutes of the game a man down, and an important man at that. Honestly? I’m not sure if Silva’s behavior merited ejection or not. Carrasco’s case, on the other hand, is much simpler. Here’s the official NCAA rulebook’s take on fighting:</p>\n<p>12.6.1 Fighting. Definition:  A fight is defined as a deliberate strike or punch or an attempt to strike or punch another player, official, coach or bench personnel. These acts include, but are not limited to, kicking, head-butting, hair pulling or an open-handed strike if done deliberately and in a malicious manner.</p>\n<p>12.6.1.1 A player, coach or bench personnel shall be ejected if he or she is guilty of fighting or leaves the coaching area to participate in an altercation.</p>\n<p>The rules are clear. Carrasco should have been gone, at least making the game an even 10-on-10 with Silva’s red card. Despite Kampmeinert’s call, midfielder Michael Tetteh managed to put the undermanned Gauchos up 1-0 late in the game off of a throw in, and it seemed as if karma would take care of things, but it wasn’t to be.</p>\n<p>Carrasco returned to the center of the action with just two minutes remaining when he evened up the score after a handball was called in the box. He was awarded a penalty kick, which he buried, sending the match into overtime. I was sitting in the distant press box at the time, so I am no judge of the play, but sophomore midfielder Machael David tells me that the game tape shows no such violation. You can choose for yourself to take that or leave it.</p>\n<p>The controversy continued even after the final whistle blew in overtime, giving Cal the 2-1 victory and sending UCSB packing. Three Gauchos — David, Tetteh and midfielder Danny Barrera — charged the referee, and Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg was forced to restrain his players in the chaos that ensued. Each was rightfully awarded a red card according to the above definition of fighting, and they may see further implications.</p>\n<p>There were a lot of dubious plays on Sunday, and I don’t claim to act as the definitive account as to what happened because I couldn’t clearly see a lot of them from the press box above the field. What I did see, from a very good vantage point in fact, was Vom Steeg’s press conference after the game.</p>\n<p>There, I saw a man that was visibly shaken by what had happened. His voice was hoarse, but his words were clear.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coaching Division I soccer for 12 years, and what I had to experience out there on the field was not fair for me, was not fair to my coaching staff, was not fair to my players. And I know exactly what I’m saying,” Vom Steeg said. “For $500 [to pay a referee], we can’t find somebody better? Really, we can’t? Five-hundred bucks? It’s not worth it to the players and the teams? I have a team that’s devastated, and there’s nothing that I can say.”</p>\n<p>On a day when a lot of players, Gauchos and Golden Bears alike, were wrong in their actions, Vom Steeg was right. The fact is, Kampmeinert took over the game and had an effect on its outcome. What’s more, he affected players who deserve the right to a game that is decided by those players and nothing else.</p>\n<p>Mistakes this egregious simply don’t happen in college football or basketball. The referees in the playoffs of those sports aren’t chosen based on how close they live to the match. College soccer’s governing bodies need to work to find a system that rotates referees, and only uses the most highly-rated ones in the most important matches.</p>\n<p>David called me the morning after the game, saying he was unable to sleep or go to class, that he felt as if a part of his soul was taken away. He said that calls like those would never stand in his native Africa or in Europe and even suggested corruption in a bad system was what robbed his team of a real chance at a national title. Senior defender Michael Boxall, whom I’ve never known to speak disparagingly of refs, said it was as if Cal had 12 players on the field, one with a whistle. Even Big Mike of the Gaucho locos had to be consoled by Chancellor Yang afterward.</p>\n<p>NCAA soccer is missing an important opportunity because of the standards for officiating. To have UCSB — the most important West Coast team by its sheer number of fans — in the College Cup would be huge for soccer in America. People would be able to see a college-level program that has incredibly devoted followers. Gaucho fans on Sunday were far louder than the Berkeley fan base, and that was just a tiny sampling of what this school has to offer. I’m not suggesting that the win be handed to the Gauchos, but they deserve a fair shot at it, something they certainly didn’t get.</p>\n<p>David, Tetteh and Barrera were absolutely wrong to react as they did. Carrasco was wrong to throw a punch as he did. Referee Kampmeinert was wrong, too. The match will go down in Gaucho soccer history as a loss, and that’s the bottom line. But when people look at that in the future, they’re missing a big story about three seniors — goalkeeper Sam Hayden, forward Joe Eubanks and Boxall — who finish their careers in Blue not with their heads held high, but in shock. This is a story about a team that was literally constructed over the last few years for the purpose of making a championship run this year at Harder Stadium. In sports losing is losing, and that’s tough sometimes. But Sunday’s match, on both sides of the ball — I’m not sure should even be called sport, because that would require an outcome based on athletic performance, not a conveniently located referee.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Eight cards were distributed during the match, and both Boxall and junior midfielder Michael Tetteh required stitches after on-field collisions with Cal players. Tetteh also changed his jersey due to blood stains from a gash on his forehead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One card, dealt in the 24th minute on a ball contested at midfield by UCSB junior midfielder Luis Silva proved to be a game-changer.</p>\n<p>Silva slid at the ball while the Golden Bears’ Servando Carrasco tried to corral it, resulting in an altercation in which Carrasco shoved Silva to the ground. Carrasco dropped to the ground shortly after. Silva received a red card and an ejection, while Carrasco received a yellow, forcing UCSB to play the remainder of the match one player down. The call was hotly contested by the Gaucho bench and coaching staff, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a regular physical game,” Carrasco said of his run-in with Silva. “We both wanted to win, he came in studs up and he got a red card and we played on. There’s nothing I can say about that. I was mad, but it’s all part of the game.”</p>\n<p>Despite Silva’s absence on the field, UCSB still outshot the Bears in the first half six to five and finished the game with 16, nine on goal. One of those shots came in the second half off the foot of Tetteh, which he powered left past the outstretched arms of Berkeley’s goalkeeper David Bingham in the 81st minute.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes when you go a man down, you actually play a little bit better,” Cal Head Coach Kevin Grimes said. “You have to work that much harder.”</p>\n<p>A called Gaucho handball in the box led to a penalty kick from Carrasco in the 88th minute. Carrasco, in a one-on-one situation with UCSB’s goalkeeper, senior Sam Hayden, managed to put the ball in the back of the net to even the score at one goal apiece.</p>\n<p>In overtime, Berkeley’s Davis Paul was able to keep his team’s hopes alive. Paul took a pass in the box and caught Hayden out of position with only two seconds remaining in the first overtime period after Hayden attempted to break up the play on the pass.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s early exit from the NCAA playoffs comes in a year when the College Cup — soccer’s version of the Final Four — is to be held in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The idea of playing in Santa Barbara in front of 15 or 16,000 people drove this group and drove the coaching staff,” Vom Steeg said. “We weren’t going to let anything stand in our way, and today was something we couldn’t help.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finish their season at 14-5-3, having made their ninth straight NCAA appearance. The squad’s three seniors, Hayden, Boxall and forward Joe Eubanks also closed out their careers in Gaucho blue on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“To have all those factors against us and still dominate as we did, to outplay Cal at their home, we’re proud of how we played,” Boxall said. “But the most important thing is the result and obviously that didn’t go our way.”</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s post-game press conference dealt largely with the controversial calls on the field and his distaste with the NCAA officiating standards.</p>\n<p>“You talk about controlling what you can control, and my guys played their hearts out with a man down,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Cal now moves on to play Brown next Sunday in the tournament’s third round.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30351\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30351\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-22/gauchos-tumble-ncaa-uc-berkeley/","id":1760,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1759,1758,1757],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bring on the Golden Bears","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If every match of the postseason goes like last night’s, Waid Ibrahim’s pacemaker is going to need replacing.

Luckily for the Gauchos, Ibrahim had other plans.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’m just glad tonight I was able to go in and score that goal,” Ibrahim said. “I was sitting there and I knew that if I went in I would have to get a goal because I didn’t know what would happen after that. I knew that this was not the end of our season.”</p>\n<p>Junior midfielder Danny Barrera notched the assist on the play, gathering a cross before sending it to Ibrahim with a shot straight at Denver’s 6’5” goalkeeper Joe Willis.</p>\n<p>“I was running at [the Denver defender] and he hesitated, so I just poked it and it went right to Waid,” Barrera said. “He knows how to finish a ball. To have someone so talented and not be able to play, I’m glad tonight he could contribute. It’s really great for everyone that he knows he can do something for us in the last five minutes, I’m glad it was him.”</p>\n<p>The box score tells the same story it has all year for UCSB: a possession domination leading to tired legs for their opposition and a late victory. Last night, the Gauchos put up 31 shots, which ties the season high they set against Cal State Fullerton on Oct. 6. Denver, on the other hand, managed just four shots, only one of them on goal.</p>\n<p>“I thought we lost to a very good UCSB team tonight,” Denver Head Coach Bobby Muuss said. “It took a very good goal to beat us. We’re down a little bit, but I’m proud of the way the guys worked together, and I think it’s something to build upon. The future’s very bright for us right now.”</p>\n<p>Now the Gauchos’ focus turns to Sunday, when they travel north to take on UC Berkeley, which had a first-round bye. After last night’s marathon match, fatigue could pose a challenge to the team, with the added challenge of forecasted rain and temperatures dipping into the 40s.</p>\n<p>“It will be a test of us to go up there and go find something,” Vom Steeg said. “Now you’ve been tested, you’ve tasted defeat right in front of you and you found a way to win a game. We go up to Cal with very little to lose. We know we can play with anybody.”</p>\n<p>The Golden Bears (12-2-3) hold a 15-11-3 record against UCSB in the all-time series, with the last meeting between the two ending in a 3-2 double overtime Cal victory in 2008. The squad, like Denver, fields a strong defense, one that has given up only 13 goals all year.</p>\n<p>“I’m fairly familiar with Cal,” Vom Steeg said. “The names, numbers and faces will change, but how they play really does not. They’re very good in the back, very disciplined and have a very good goalie. That’s Cal.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff on Sunday is set for 1:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30232\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30232\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-19/bring-golden-bears/","id":1740,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1739,1738,1737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Back Line Looks to Make Noise in Playoffs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"How does one judge defense without the clear-cut statistics of other sports like baseball and basketball?

I love hitting people,” Hayden said. “Pretty much every time I come out for a cross I hit someone. I almost punched Boxall in the back of the head the other night. Box is the same way. He likes showing everyone where his territory is, and if you come in there with the ball he’ll make you pay.”</p>\n<p>Boxall was raised in Auckland, New Zealand, a country where most kids grow up with a different kind of ball in their hands.</p>\n<p>“I used to play rugby, but I switched to soccer when I was about 10 or 11,” Boxall said. “My high school was a big rugby school, kind of like how football is here. It gets all the attention. I’m glad I switched, it’s taken me to a bunch of places I would have never been able to go and I’m very thankful to be in Santa Barbara right now.”</p>\n<p>“Super” Sam is not exactly a California native either. He was born in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, then moved to Arizona to attend Yavapai College. There, Hayden won two consecutive NJCAA Goalkeeper of the Year awards to go along with the team’s pair of national championships. Not bad for a recruit touted as “too short,” at 5’10.”</p>\n<p>“What I saw was somebody with unbelievable athleticism, who was getting up and over everybody, and who had hands that were incredibly big and strong,” Head Coach Vom Steeg told UCSB Athletics in a story about Hayden’s recruitment process earlier this year. “I told Stu [Dobson, UCSB’s goalkeeper coach], ‘This kid is unbelievable,’ and he goes, ‘How big is he?’ When I said 5’10”, he told me to forget it.”</p>\n<p>Now that the two find themselves united by a common goal in UCSB’s backfield, they’ve become fast friends, joking with each other about their special relationship.</p>\n<p>“We have this joke with one of my friends that Boxall is my number one and she’s my number two,” Hayden said with a laugh. “She doesn’t really like that too much.”</p>\n<p>Despite Boxall’s 200-pound frame and Hayden’s affinity for throwing a punch or two in the box, they both insist the Gaucho defense is about a lot more than just starting fights with opposing teams.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we instigate it,” Boxall says. “With the players that we have like Chris [Hunter], Peter [McGlynn], [Michael] Tetteh and [James] Kiffe, we can basically take whatever they want to throw at us. All of us can handle the physical players, the fast speedy players, but we’re also skilled enough to handle the technically savvy players.”</p>\n<p>Those abilities will be put on the line tonight when Gaucho soccer hosts Denver in the NCAA tournament’s first round. The two teams have not met since 2001, though the Pioneers hosted Gaucho rival Cal Poly in a 1-0 early season loss. The classic sports cliché tells players to take a season one game at a time and never to look beyond an early opponent. But with the College Cup — soccer’s version of the Final Four — being held in Santa Barbara in December, it seems an easy piece of advice to ignore.</p>\n<p>“It’s in the back of our head, of course it is,” Hayden said. “It’s hard for it not to be. But we’re not going to get there if we don’t take care of [Denver]. It’s good motivation for us, but we have to take care of business in the games beforehand.”</p>\n<p>Hayden and Boxall, as leaders of the team, are poised to make a run at a national title. But to beat Denver, or any other team, the Gauchos will need more than just the two of them, and they are the first to say so.</p>\n<p>“Everyone on our squad works their asses off,” Boxall said. “You can tell when we just take over games in the second half. Other teams are just too fatigued. That’s a product of us working hard in the offseason, our coaches running us into the ground, and it seems to be paying its dividends now.”</p>\n<p>At this stage in the season, every team has injuries and every team feels the fatigue. For this pair of seniors playing out their final games in Gaucho blue, overcoming that exhaustion is more than just an objective: It’s a necessity.</p>\n<p>“Our goal, with the players that we have, is to go all the way,” Boxall said. “We’ve known that ever since we got knocked out by UCLA last year. That’s what we’ve been working toward for the last eight, nine months, and it’s definitely going to be a huge disappointment if we don’t.”</p>\n<p>Boxall, along with the rest of the squad, never talks about stats, only wins. Don’t expect that to change with a month left of tournament soccer against the nation’s best.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/gaucho-line-noise-playoffs/","id":1701,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1700,1699,1698],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Soccer to Host Denver in NCAA Tournament First Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gaucho soccer received word of its NCAA tournament seeding Monday, when the selection committee announced that the team will face Denver in the first round at Harder Stadium this Thursday, Nov. 18 at ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Gaucho soccer received word of its NCAA tournament seeding Monday, when the selection committee announced that the team will face Denver in the first round at Harder Stadium this Thursday, Nov. 18 at 7 p.m. UCSB earned an automatic bid to the tournament after taking down Cal State Fullerton 3-1 in the Big West Tournament finals.</p>\n<p>“Obviously we’re always excited to play in front of the home crowd,” senior defender Michael Boxall said. “And then the added importance of it being an NCAA tournament game makes it a lot more exciting.

Junior midfielder Danny Barrera took a ball from sophomore Nic Ryan in the 19th minute, slipping it past Fullerton’s keeper low and left to put UCSB on the board first, 1-0. Just three minutes later, junior midfielder Luis Silva would add the eventual game winner with an unassisted goal off his own deflected corner to put his team up by two, sending the 4,613 spectators in attendance into a frenzy.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to take it last year, but unfortunately we didn’t,” Silva said. “We had another chance last night and we did what we had to do. It feels good, but I couldn’t have done it without the team. It’s a group thing; I’m glad we did it together.”</p>\n<p>Silva’s goal, coupled with three shots on goal and four overall, earned him Big West Tournament MVP honors, but Silva’s red-hot foot was all part of a Gaucho trend that has been building all season long. Vom Steeg’s team has outshot its opponent in every match this season, culminating in 15 shots on goal on Saturday which ties a season-high.</p>\n<p>Fullerton, on the other hand, put up just eight shots overall. Its only goal came in the 27th minute, when midfielder Kevin Venegas bent in a cross, which defender Jesse Escalante headed past the outstretched arms of UCSB’s senior goalkeeper Sam Hayden.</p>\n<p>One common theme throughout the match was its physical nature. Eight yellow cards were handed out over the course of the match, with each team receiving four. Outside of the cards, Saturday’s match was full of pushes and shoves on both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that Fullerton needed to win that game to make it to the tournament,” Vom Steeg said. “Anytime you’re playing a team and it could be their last game, you’re going to get everything. That’s the way it’s going to be all the way out.”</p>\n<p>Boxall, who stands at 6’2” and weighs 200 pounds, has seen and given his fair share of elbows this season, with last night being no exception.</p>\n<p>“I love it when it gets physical; that’s the way I play,” Boxall said. “I’ve yet to come across someone who can out-physical me. If they like to play that way, it’s playing into our hands and to our strengths.”</p>\n<p>With the win, the Gauchos earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, which begins on Nov. 18. Though UCSB would likely have received a spot in the 48-team tournament regardless of Saturday’s result, the win improves the team’s chances for an early-round home game. Gaucho players and coaches will discover their fate today, when the tournament selection takes place on ESPNU.</p>\n<p>These Gauchos are a very different team from the ones who took the field in September, coming out of the gates with a 0-2-2 record before rattling off 13 wins in its last 16 games to close out the season at 13-4-3 overall. Now, their focus shifts forward</p>\n<p>“Like I said from the beginning, I like this group,” Vom Steeg said. “All we know is our name is going to come up [on Monday’s selection show]. That’s all you can really do at this stage, is see who we’re going to play. Hopefully, we’ll get a home game, and we’ll go from there.”</p>\n<p>For a team that is preparing for its ninth-consecutive NCAA tournament appearance, Saturday’s win was little more than a warm-up for the real goal: another national title.</p>\n<p>“[The win over Fullerton] gives us a little boost, but we can’t get too confident, because we don’t know who we’re going play next or their style,” Silva said. “It’s playoffs now and we have to take it one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>Monday’s selection show begins at 1:30 p.m. when the team will host a viewing party in the Intercollegiate Athletics Building to find out who will be its first-round opponent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/gauchos-capture-conference-tourney-title-fullerton/","id":1712,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1711,1710,1709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB soccer captured its first ever Big West Championship on Saturday, taking out fourth-seeded Cal State Fullerton 3-1 in the conference championship game at Harder Stadium.

Its opponent will be Cal State Fullerton, which defeated #1 seed UC Irvine in a 2-1 upset on Wednesday. Although the Gauchos have made each of the last two conference tournament finals, the Anteaters have beaten them both times.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited about the fact that Irvine lost,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “There’s very little love lost there.”</p>\n<p>Since the #2 Gauchos are seeded higher than Fullerton, UCSB will host the final round of the tournament at Harder Stadium. This year, the squad is 8-1-1 in matches at its home pitch, including its last eight in a row and a 3-0 home victory against Fullerton on Oct. 6.</p>\n<p>“These games are so emotional and there’s so much taken out of you that it’s so hard to bounce back in two days,” Vom Steeg said. “That’s been our struggle in the Big West Championships. It’s our third one now, and we’re 0-2 because we’re just wiped out. The idea of playing that game with our home crowd is really critical for us to get it done.”</p>\n<p>The Titans, who boast a 7-11-2 record overall, feature Nick Posthuma in their attack, who has scored nine goals on the season. Sophomore forward Sam Garza, as a comparison, has nine goals of his own to lead UCSB. Look for the Gauchos to get up shots, as they have gotten up more balls than their opponents in 21 straight matches — an average of 15.7 per game — including Wednesday’s victory over Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Kickoff on Saturday is set for 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29614\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-11/chos-return-big-west-finals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29614\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-11/chos-return-big-west-finals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-11/chos-return-big-west-finals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-11/chos-return-big-west-finals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-11/chos-return-big-west-finals/","id":1715,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1714,1713,1712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Oust Cal Poly in Big West Tourney Semis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It took more than regular time, but Gaucho soccer outlasted Cal Poly on the way to a 2-1 overtime victory in the first round of the Big West championships.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It took more than regular time, but Gaucho soccer outlasted Cal Poly on the way to a 2-1 overtime victory in the first round of the Big West championships.

Gordon gets up a lot of points, but is all over the place as far as efficiency. One night, he’ll shoot 60 percent and the next 20 percent. His last game at Utah? Some stat-line gems include shooting 9-22 from the field, 0-6 from distance. Do you really believe that when a good defensive team, like those other guys from L.A. for example, lock it down in the playoffs, Eric fucking Gordon is going to be the man? Too inconsistent.</p>\n<p><strong>Blake Griffin</strong>: Eighteen and 11 are some beast numbers, I’m not going to lie. Those scare me as an opponent every time. Plus he gets those points with skill and finesse; he’s not a Dwight Howard, so muscularly out of control that all he can do is dunk, which means that he’ll last longer and people can’t really plan for what exactly he’s going to do against you. He’s a +19.4 in efficiency according to ESPN, but the rest of his team starts him off so low, at such a disadvantage, that he can never have nearly enough to get back on the levels of other teams. The Clippers are 25th in the league in scoring, so until Blakey puts up 30 and 20 every night, I don’t want to hear it. [Editor’s note: I’ll probably be eating my words when he does this by season’s end.]</p>\n<p><strong>The other guys</strong>: Ah, the Chris Kaman and the Ryan Gomes’ of the world. You’ve got to love those guys. A combined 34 percent FG (from “big men,” no less) and 12.9 boards together (Joakim Noah, who leads the league, averages 14.2 alone), plus a whole lot of crazy hair, and they don’t look like so much anymore. You know they’ll supply the hustle, the fire and the heart. Hustle is the ugly sister of talent, and you need both to be the one who steps up when it counts. The only other Clipper to start any games is Eric Bledsoe, but 8.4 points along with 2.6 turnovers doesn’t strike fear into the heart of anybody.</p>\n<p>If you couple those with a coach that could only take frickin’ Derrick Rose to a pair of first-round playoff exits, this team simply doesn’t have a chance. Remember Baron up there? He manages to hurt you even with his ass planted squarely on the bench. The reason is his contract. Clippers ownership has three years and $41 million left to pay the man. I’d be sorry, but it really doesn’t even matter at this point.</p>\n<p>The Clippers don’t have Los Angeles basketball fans behind them, have the wrong guys playing and, most of all, they’re balls deep in a culture of losing.</p>\n<p>Clipper Nation has enough to worry about as a 1-6 team that’s tied with Minnesota for league doormat. I’m sure the real fans know all the numbers, because I hear they’re pretty good people. Then again, I can’t be completely sure. I’m not sure if I’ve ever really met one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29305\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/clippers-suck-heres/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29305\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/clippers-suck-heres/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/clippers-suck-heres/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/clippers-suck-heres/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/clippers-suck-heres/","id":921,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[920,919,918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set to Kick Off 2010 Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For the first time this season, a loss for #2 UCSB would mean more than just disappointment.

Now, back on its larger home pitch, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s squad gets a chance for redemption.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re excited about playing this game,” Vom Steeg said. “You don’t always get a chance to follow up a loss by playing the same team again so quickly. It’s not just the field and its dimensions, but we play well at home and we should be a team that’s fired up to play after earning the right to play this game at our place.”</p>\n<p>Harder Stadium has been one of UCSB’s strongest weapons this year, and the second-seeded Gauchos will look to extend an 11-game undefeated streak against Cal Poly there. They will have to do so without sophomore midfielder Machael David, who will sit out tonight’s match after sustaining his fifth yellow card of the season against UC Riverside Saturday. David, who is vital to the team as a ball handler and an aggressive midfield presence, has been absent for just 19 minutes in UCSB’s 18 matches so far this season.</p>\n<p>“It really hurts because my season will be done if we don’t win,” David said. “But the guys are fired up, and we know it’s a do or die game. It comes down to who wants it the most and I think our guys want it the most. That is why I am crossing my fingers so hard to get the win, no matter how we do it, to go and win the conference.”</p>\n<p>Losing a workhorse like David forces Vom Steeg to make some adjustments to a team that has consistently played with the same game plan of scoring early and often. The Gauchos have outshot their opponents in every game this season, including the Oct. 27 loss to the Mustangs,  23-13.</p>\n<p>“We want to just stay with what’s gotten us where we’re at right now and not change too much,” Vom Steeg said. “The problem is that we did lose Machael, so that does force us to make some changes. But we’ve had lots of different players step in at different times, so I’m confident whoever steps in will do well for us.”</p>\n<p>One certainty is that the playoff atmosphere at Harder will be electric. The nationally televised game at Cal Poly brought in 8,125 people, with the teams’ first meeting of the season in Santa Barbara drawing 6,057. Now, with an automatic NCAA tournament berth at stake for the Big West Tournament winner, the pressure will be on for both sides.</p>\n<p>“You know it could be your last game, that you’re going to get a team’s best,” Garza said. “Nothing’s set in stone, you’ve got to come out and play hard the whole game. The playoff atmosphere will be intense, I can’t wait.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff tonight will be at 7 p.m. The winner of the match moves on to Saturday’s final round of the Big West Tournament to play the winner of tonight’s other match, Cal State Fullerton at UC Irvine.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/ucsb-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/ucsb-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/ucsb-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/ucsb-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/ucsb-set-kick-2010-postseason/","id":1709,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1708,1707,1706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Maul Highlanders, Capture Second in Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a special pre-game introduction, seniors Sam Hayden, Michael Boxall and Joe Eubanks took the field on senior night and imposed their will on UC Riverside, taking home a 2-0 victory on Saturday a...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a special pre-game introduction, seniors Sam Hayden, Michael Boxall and Joe Eubanks took the field on senior night and imposed their will on UC Riverside, taking home a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit id=20124 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/gauchos-maul-highlanders-capture-big-west/jti_m-soc_vs_ucriverside-18/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-29163\"><img data-attachment-id=\"29163\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/gauchos-maul-highlanders-capture-big-west/jti_m-soc_vs_ucriverside-18/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/JTI_M-Soc_vs_UCRiverside-18.jpg?fit=1500%2C990&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,990\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D2H\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1289102256\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"240\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"JTI_M-Soc_vs_UCRiverside (18)\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Junior midfielder Danny Barrera looks to control a pass against a Riverside defender Saturday.

In the second half I think we did a better job of making runs at the box.”</p>\n<p>After the game winner, the defense took over, allowing Riverside just four shots.\t“We emphasized getting behind the ball and we went over how they scored their goals last time,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I knew we would play better here than we did down there anyway. I’m not surprised we got the shutout tonight; we’ve been playing well in the back and developing defensively so it’s just a continuation of that.”</p>\n<p>The victory brings UCSB to 11-4-3 overall and 7-2-1 in the Big West, good for a second-place finish in the conference and a #2 seed in the conference tournament this week when it plays Cal Poly at home on Wednesday. The reigning Big West champs had a chance to repeat, but UC Irvine took down Cal State Fullerton 3-1 for the regular season crown.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is last year we went 8-1-1 and this year we went 7-2-1,” Vom Steeg said. “I always think you need seven or eight wins to take the conference and this year Irvine did enough. Any time we show up anywhere it’s going to be a difficult game. We know we’re getting the best of the teams we’re playing against and I think it’s always harder for us to win league.”</p>\n<p>“If you told us [we didn’t win the regular season title] at the beginning we wouldn’t have been happy with it,” Boxall added. “But the way things have gone, we’re pretty satisfied now having Cal Poly at home on Wednesday and looking forward to Irvine if they hold up against Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match also marked the night in which Gaucho spectators shattered national attendance records. The 5,103 at Harder brought the stadium’s average attendance to 6,451, breaking the previous record of 4,355 that UCSB set last year.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Hayden also inked his name into the record books, needing only one save as he tallied his 24th career shutout, placing him third on the all-time Gaucho list.</p>\n<p>The Big West Championship tournament begins Wednesday, with Cal Poly coming to Santa Barbara to try and break the teams’ 1-1 split in matches this season. The last meeting between the two was on Oct. 27, a 2-1 overtime loss for UCSB in front of national television cameras at Cal Poly. This time, the new setting could give the match a new feel.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to see a much different game compared to at Cal Poly because the size of our field plays into our hands,” Boxall said. “It makes their jobs a lot harder because their field is built for the way they play, as ours is for us, so we’re excited to make Cal Poly run a lot more and hopefully get the win.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. on Wednesday. If UCSB wins, they will take on the winner of UC Irvine v. Cal State Fullerton on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29155\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/gauchos-maul-highlanders-capture-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29155\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/gauchos-maul-highlanders-capture-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/gauchos-maul-highlanders-capture-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/gauchos-maul-highlanders-capture-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-07/gauchos-maul-highlanders-capture-big-west/","id":1705,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1704,1703,1702],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/93"}},"__N_SSG":true}
