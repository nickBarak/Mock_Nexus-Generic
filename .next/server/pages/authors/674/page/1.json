So if you’re having trouble dumping too-controlling Kyle, just send him this song — the first couple lines will make it clear: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now I do what I want / Now I do what I want.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>2. “Fuck Off” by Tierra Whack </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After countless disappointments, gaslighting and manipulation, you’ve had enough and there is nothing more they can say to you to change your mind. There’s nothing else you want to tell them and Tierra Whack says it perfectly: “Fuck off!” Whack leaves it all on the table with this song: “You broke, you ain’t no good for me at all / I wrote this ’cause I feel ten feet tall / I know you don’t ever wanna see me ball” and “You remind me of my deadbeat dad.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>3. “Post Break-Up Up Sex” by The Vaccines</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one’s a double whammy as it can double as a song title you send to your ex just to be cheeky, but it’s also a song you can simp to after realizing that the post-breakup sex you had with that one girl in your section just made you feel awkward and even more shitty. Cheers! </span></p>\n<p><strong>4. “No Scrubs” by TLC </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you break it to the Type A pre-med student you’ve been dating for a couple of weeks that you really aren’t looking to be a part of his 10-year plan in which he’s already scheduled your 25-minute lunch dates during his residency at U. Washington? Well of course, just take TLC’s classic, literally, and let him know you aren’t looking to date a scrub-wearing micromanager.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5. “BYF” by A$AP Mob</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you do when you accidentally lead someone on for months and now they think you’re dating but you’re really trying to get with their best friend? Just send them this song. There’s no way they won’t get it after repeatedly hearing “I just, I just wanna be your friend.”</span></p>\n<p><strong>6. “I Thought About Killing You” by Kanye West</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of you cannot wait to get rid of your significant other; you’ve told all your friends you’re going to break up with them but something just keeps coming up. When you’re in the final cathartic state and you’re just done, nothing speaks your mind better than just telling them “Today, I seriously thought about killing you.”</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"125067850\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"91297\"><img data-attachment-id=\"91298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/10-songs-for-your-soon-to-be-ex/1-23/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?fit=828%2C1393&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"828,1393\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?fit=149%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?fit=609%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-91298 alignright\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-609x1024.jpg?resize=424%2C713\" alt=\"\" width=\"424\" height=\"713\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?resize=609%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 609w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?resize=149%2C250&amp;ssl=1 149w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?resize=768%2C1292&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?w=828&amp;ssl=1 828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>7. “What More Can I Say” by NxWorries </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve tried to break up with them countless times, but the conversation always ends in you being convinced to give it another chance and thus another round of make-up sex. Well, not this time! You’ve already got it all off your chest, there’s nothing else to say.</span></p>\n<p><strong>8. “Skrt” by Kodak Black</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kodak Black leaves no room for questions when he says “then I skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt” — you know he’s done with this girl. For all of you who are ready to live your college single life (I know you freshmen are ready to lose your high school boos), hit ‘em with this song and avoid all subtlety — they’ll know. Enjoy college, you’re welcome.</span></p>\n<p><strong>9. “Por Tu Maldito Amor” by Vicente Fernández</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You remember that uncle that would have a few too many beers at your family parties as a kid, especially at random ones like a kid’s birthday party or first Communion? No? Well just imagine it. This song would come on and he’d grip his beer extra tight, use it as a mic and yell at the top of his lungs, “Y ya pa’ qué quiero la tumba / Si ya me enterraste en vida / Ajaja, ayy!” You’d look at him confused, laughing and wondering who hurt this man. Twenty years later, you’re sitting on the floor, tears dripping on your phone in one hand, a bottle of something unholy in the other, sending this song to your ex-amante. Guess who’s laughing now. </span></p>\n<p><strong>10. “LEAVE ME ALONE” by Kari Faux </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes after all is done, all you want is to be left alone. Although Kaytranada’s version is a classic, Kari Faux’s cover really puts the message across with her chorus, “Don’t hit my line, don’t call my phone / And don’t waste my time, leave me alone.” Amen Faux, amen.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months ago I had the honor of attending South by Southwest </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or “South By” as its often referred to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Austin, Texas. I witnessed a number of live bands and performances across iconic music venues spread throughout downtown Austin, like Stubb’s BBQ, Mohawk, Elephant Room and Antone’s Nightclub. Despite having undeniably one of the best weeks of my life, I felt like I had missed something, and it definitely wasn’t a shortage of Austin BBQ or spicy fried chicken. Watching a show at Antone’s was an experience in itself, but the whole time I wished that by some miracle Austin-born guitarist, Gary Clark Jr., would make a surprise appearance to the same venue that kick-started his career many years ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember first watching the musical prowess of Gary Clark Jr. (GCJ) during a concert scene in the John Favreau movie “Chef.” I’ve been charmed and captivated by his guitar skills and vocal range ever since. As a fan of Jimi Hendrix’s psychedelic guitar solos, Grant Green’s jazz scales and ‘70 and ‘80’s blues-rock throughout my musically formative childhood years, GCJ was like a new scoop in an ice cream shop full of timeless flavors that had grown to be well loved but routine. His style is a fusion of blues, soul, R&amp;B and hip-hop with vocal abilities ranging from low ominous grumbles to honeyed high-pitched ballads that have evolved and grown in experimentation throughout his three-album discography. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On tour for his most recent album “This Land,” Gary Clark Jr. electrified, mesmerized and satisfied passionate fans last Friday night at the Santa Barbara Bowl. Filling the entire bowl with his presence makes me wonder how he was able to contain his enigmatic energy in the small bar venues of Austin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An opener worthy of his own show, British singer/songwriter Michael Kiwanuka primed the night for a journey into sweet sounds of symphony, harmony and all the contrasts along the way. Drawing from inspirations like Nirvana and Radiohead, his indie-folk sound also borrows sounds from his Ugandan heritage which come together harmoniously and leave quite an impression on new listeners. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walking opposite of the crowd heading toward concessions to top of their beers before GCJ, I heard several comments: “I mean I knew one song of his, but wow he was really amazing,” “That was an opener? He deserves his own concert!” and “I don’t know what it is, but he made me feel amazing.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90158\" style=\"width: 863px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1271546966\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"90155\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90158\" data-attachment-id=\"90158\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/gary-clark-jr-brings-blues-and-rock-to-santa-barbara-bowl/dsc_0239/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?fit=853%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"853,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0239\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90158\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?resize=853%2C1280\" alt=\"\" width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?w=853&amp;ssl=1 853w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90158\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ivan Gonzalez / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, the crowd settled back into their seats, anxiously waiting for Sonny Boy Slim (aka Gary Clark Jr.) to make his way on stage. With all of the roadies and technicals assistant walking on, we knew it wasn’t long.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lights dimmed, then an eerie blue aura covered the stage. Gary’s slender six-foot-five build strutted effortlessly cool onto center stage with his signature heavy cloth beanie, a heavy button up jacket, boots and skinny jeans, immediately receiving an uproar of cheers and an occasional “I LOVE YOU GARY!” or “YOU F***ING ROCK GARY!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joined by bassist Johnny Bradley, rhythm guitarist King Zapata, drummer Johnny Radelat and keyboardist Jon Deas, the group got into position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the iconic opening chords the bowl pulsated in excitement as the group opened with “Bright Lights” from the debut “Blak and Blu” album. The lyrics set the tone for the night as he repeated “You’re gonna know my name by the end of the night.” Riding off the energy from the first track, they followed up with “Feelin’ Like a Million” and “Low Down Rolling Stone” off of “This Land.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each lull in his music, excited yells of “I LOVE YOU!” could be heard amongst the crowds. The energy of the performance fluctuated between making you feel like you were in the back of a small bar in Austin, hearing some world-class blues among an old wooden exterior with deep blue lights, to making you feel like you were in love at a Valentine’s Day dance, with pink lights and melodies reminiscent of oldies your parents listened to.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90157\" style=\"width: 863px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1643460533\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"90155\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90157\" data-attachment-id=\"90157\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/gary-clark-jr-brings-blues-and-rock-to-santa-barbara-bowl/version-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?fit=853%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"853,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Version 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90157\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?resize=853%2C1280\" alt=\"\" width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?w=853&amp;ssl=1 853w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90157\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ivan Gonzalez / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guitar solos would grip the crowd into a trance as we watched Gary grip his guitar neck feverishly with wild expressions on his face, showing the passion and energy he was putting out. Equally as captivating was Jon Deas who entered a few piano solos that kept the crowd jumping, swaying and letting it all loose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An exposition of his new album, the songs all varied in themes and feelings that I can only describe as like driving a ‘69 Camaro through a desert, in a thunderstorm of emotions, eventually reaching a point of peace marked by clouds clearing and exposing a sunset of serenity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guitar solo after guitar solo, the crowd cheered “Gary! Gary! Gary!” before he exited the stage, which to everyone’s excitement wasn’t the end as he came back out once again for an encore. Thanking both his “squad” and the crowd for an unbelievable night, Gary exclaimed, “Representing Austin, Texas everywhere I go!” and ended the night with classics like “When My Train Pulls In” and a hard-hitter cover of “Come Together.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary’s new album highlights his creativity and range in creating crowd-pleasing songs that also touch on the political landscape and black experience of growing up in Texas. Despite being 1,500 miles away from Austin, the Santa Barbara crowd showed so much love and energy for Gary Clark Jr. that it almost felt like I was back among the crowd in Antone’s.</span></p><div

stick. Even if you’re listening to recommendations, nothing has that sound that grabs you in and doesn’t let go. I remember going through Spotify’s “Made for You” playlists thinking, “Wow, these algorithms really think I’m going to like this?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was until “I Like It” by The Marías came on. The quiet introduction into a funky drum and synth beat led me into lead singer María’s breathy soft yet definitive voice singing “physical…” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song had psychedelic melodies, an infectious tempo that kept my foot bobbing and a nostalgic but entirely new sound at the same time. The rest of their discography consisting of “Super Clean, Vol I” and “Super Clean, Vol II” continues this energy of funky, soulful, jazzy, psychedelic and mesmerizing vocals. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LA-based psychedelic-soul group began in 2016 after the fateful meeting of singer María, going only by her first name, and drummer and now romantic partner, Josh Conway. The rest of the band includes trumpeter Gabe Steiner, guitarist Jesse Perlman, pianist Edward James and bassist Carter Lee. Since then, they have been blessing ear drums and curating an aesthetic reminiscent of a different time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their unique inspirations and backgrounds have gifted them with masterful tools to mold their sound into a beautiful blend of what makes them </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">them</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Born in Puerto Rico and raised in Atlanta, María’s background comes out splendidly in their songwriting where she pulls from her Latin origins to skilfully transition between songs in Spanish and English. (Although, it was Conway who approached her first with the idea to make a song in Spanish, which would become “Déjate Llevar” on “Superclean, Vol I.”)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Marías performed a captivating, sensual and vivacious set Saturday night at Santa Barbara’s SOhO Club. Ni</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ñ</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a opened for The Marías, delivering a solid set of smooth indie to warm up the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As everyone anxiously waited, a D’Angelo backtrack played over head, the lights dimmed and soft red light illuminated the stage in a romantic aura. The stage played to their aesthetic with a gold-framed classical painting and a dark silver women’s bust. Eventually, they emerged and were welcomed by the diverse, young and old crowd. Wearing what appeared to be a black bowling-style button-downs with pink trim, they further played into their retro posh old Hollywood look. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the cheers subsided, the quiet keys of “Cariño” began to play, erupting another cheer from the crowd. The bassy guitar tabs entered adding to the funky rhythm, then leading to silence as María’s velvety voice is ushered in. The bilingual poetry enchanted the crowd to sway about, singing along word for word. The trumpet assured the crowd they were in for a fun night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A soothing wave then overtook the crowd, transcending us into a dream like state with the lyrics, as a song titled “Only In My Dreams” should. María’s voice hypnotized the crowd and had us wrapped around her finger, every slight dance move or sway poured energy in the crowd. My personal favorite, “I Like It,” followed, throwing the crowd into dance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway got the spotlight for his intro in “Superclean,” leaving  concertgoers swooning over his drumming and singing. As Conway and María  each other loving glances while singing together, we were able to understand the feeling these two put in when creating their music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soft synths of “Over the Moon,” María’s smooth ASMR-like voice and the red hues had the crowd even more in love. “Let’s get groovy!” someone in the crowd shouted. “ABQ” followed, provoking another attendee to yell “This is baby-making music!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the crowd’s surprise, they began their cover of Britney Spears’s “Baby One More Time,” which retained that fierce quality of the original song but had the soft, classy feeling of The Marias. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrapping up their set with “Basta Ya,” the trumpet took the spotlight, creating a feeling like we were in a 50’s jazz club. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To no surprise, the audience cheered “Encore, encore, encore!” then “Otra, otra, otra!” Conway came out to talk a bit with the crowd and had everyone doing the Cha-Cha Slide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the band came out, performing “Clueless” and “Loveboy,” ending strong with “Déjate Llevar.”  The crowd cheered and whistled for what truly was an incredible set. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a psychedelic-soul sound, retro old Hollywood glamor and bilingual romance lyrics, The Marías have something organic and fresh that is just what we need. It strikes a tune within many of us and represents a creative force that draws inspiration from their backgrounds and history to make something we can all feel apart of. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an independent band, we can be sure their creative process will continue to produce music that bends genres and has us feeling in love. </span></p><div

the UCen to Storke Plaza, a smorgasbord of UCSB students flaunting colorful hair and wearing in mom jeans or pastel colored shoes munched on bags of Hot Cheetos under the sun as they anticipated the entrance of Claire Cottrill.</p>\n<p>Cottrill, better known by her stage name, Clairo, first entered the music scene back in 2015 when her music video for “Pretty Girl” — featuring the artist goofily dancing to her song and lip-syncing in front a webcam — went viral. In the span of less than a year, Clairo has risen to prominence among similar bedroom pop artists such as Bane’s World, Jakob Ogawa, No Vacation and Gus Dapperton.</p>\n<p>Nineteen-year-old Cottrill has been dreaming to break into music since she was 13, writing and posting music onto Bandcamp and SoundCloud. Now, entering her first year at Syracuse University, she is currently managed by the same manager Chance the Rapper had when he began his rise to stardom.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Recently, Clairo had her first big performance at Tyler, the Creator’s sold-out show at the Observatory for over 6,000 people. She performed alongside acts like Steve Lacy, Brockhampton, Michael Seyer and Inner Wave. Last Thursday, UCSB was lucky enough to be graced by Clairo’s first live performance with a band at A.S. Program Board’s Noon Storke Show.</p>\n<p>The crowd anxiously awaited the emerging pop star, who is expected to drop a six-song EP featuring Dublin rapper Rejjie Snow later this year. Humorously, Program Board gave out free bags of Flaming Hot Cheetos (in reference to her popular single of the same name), along with Yerba Mate.</p>\n<p>The eagerness to see Clairo garnered a crowd that not only filled the stairs but also hugged the walls overlooking Storke Plaza. Kids from an elementary school touring UCSB got to witness this gathering of students and entertained the collegiate group by dancing to the songs that filled the empty sound space before the show.</p>\n<p>Clairo came out from the KCSB courtyard skipping and sporting a casual UCSB shirt, and she warmly greeted the crowd. Immediately the students clapped and cheered in excitement as Clairo and her new band filled in blanks of the stage framed by the palm trees. They played classic songs such as “Pretty Girl” and “Flaming Hot Cheetos,” newer songs such as “4EVER,” an unreleased track and a cover of “Nakamarra” by Hiatus Kaiyote.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83086\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"161428297\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83084\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83086\" data-attachment-id=\"83086\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/flaminhotyerba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"flaminhotyerba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83086\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83086\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kelly He / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>With a live band, her sound was very different from her recorded tracks –– but in a good way. Ditching the lo-fi, synth-pop sound, Clairo took on a more indie-alternative take on her songs, substituting manufactured electronic beats with echoing, raw guitar licks, rumbling electric bass lines and shrill strikes of cymbals.</p>\n<p>For songs like “4EVER” and “Pretty Girl,” the band looped a backtrack of the iconic melodies but decorated it with jazzy additions played on their instruments. “Flaming Hot Cheetos” pleasantly surprised us with a funky breakdown at the end of the song, leaving the crowd smiling as Clairo bopped along while eating a bag of Hot Cheetos someone kindly threw to her before the song began.</p>\n<p>The charming, happy vibe of Clairo’s dreamy voice that floated above smooth guitar, bass and drums was the perfect sound to fill the air on a beautiful sunny day at UCSB.</p>\n<p>When the set was beginning to wrap up, the crowd demanded more. It was a relatively quick set, consisting of no more than ten songs. The crowd was prepared, however, and immediately began suggesting other songs they wanted her to perform when she apologized for the short set.</p>\n<p>Clairo was apparently flustered by the high demand of an encore, as she replied to her yelling fans, “Why are you yelling at me?”</p>\n<p>This moment also made it onto the Overheard at UCSB Facebook page and was quote tweeted by Clairo herself.</p>\n<p>For Clairo’s much anticipated encore, the band did another performance of “4EVER.” This time, initiated by a student sitting near the stage, people were encouraged to leave the stairs and dance at the front. The concert turned into a dance party reminiscent of teenagers just letting loose and having fun, twirling and grooving away their cares to the upbeat pop tune.</p>\n<p>After the dance party ended, people rushed to line up for the opportunity to meet her and take photos. Many students brought gifts; one handed her a bracelet and another a drawing. Students who came less prepared scrambled to find things for her to autograph. She was presented a range of items to sign: shoes, empty Hot Cheeto bags, skateboards, laptops and even an inhaler.</p>\n<p>Clairo’s luminescent presence left UCSB students glowing and wishing to “feel this way forever.” Make sure to look out for her EP –– although it has no official release date, it’s expected to be released soon. We’re looking forward to seeing how this bedroom pop sensation continues to shift out of her lo-fi sound in her upcoming EP.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/","id":6640,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[6639,6638,6637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tropicalia Fest Opens in Long Beach with a Splash","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tropicalia-Graphic....jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tropicalia-Graphic....jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The musical acts, along with the assortment of Mexican cuisine, created a festival culture that resonated among the evolving Latinx culture of Southern California.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<p>Tropicalia Fest opened its doors for the first time to enthusiastic music and taco lovers at Queen Mary Park in Long Beach. The sold-out music festival, hosted by comedian Felipe Esparza, attracted a beautifully colorful young and old crowd due to its generationally transcending all-star lineup. The festival featured legendary norteño band Los Tigres del Norte, passionate Latina songstress Kali Uchis, deep and powerful English singer King Krule, indie psychedelic soul rockers Chicano Batman and 30 other diverse performers. The musical acts, along with the assortment of Mexican cuisine, created a festival culture that resonated among the evolving Latinx culture of Southern California.</p>\n</div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To avoid traffic issues, shuttles were arranged to pick up festival goers at the Long Beach Convention Center parking lot and shuttle them to Long Beach Port. Even upon arriving early, there was already a line of eager taco enthusiasts at the gates hoping to cash in on the free taco samples that lasted until four.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Four stages throughout the festival grounds offered a wide range of musical performances. Entering the festival, attendees were greeted by the modest Modelo Stage, which provided a platform for smaller artists, such as the Beach Bums and Jessie Reyes, to perform. It also hosted older performers, like Banda Skalavera and Wanda Jackson, who would be familiar to oldies music lovers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The main stage, Tropicalia, overlooked San Pedro Bay and the Long Beach waterfront, creating a very picturesque atmosphere. Large L.E.D. screens allowed audiences to enjoy views of the band and visuals while standing in the front or sitting on Mexican blankets in the back.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The time approached when our Corona-soaked stomachs began to crave the salty and savory flavors of tacos. A graffiti-covered concrete tunnel bridged the main stage area to the food vendors and the other two stages. Over 20 local vendors boasted a multitude of taco types, from classic birria and vegan to even bánh mì renditions. In addition to tacos, there were other choices such as pozole verde and carnitas taquitos that did not disappoint. The long lines limited the advertised freedom of all-you-can-eat, but people still waited ridiculous amounts of time because, in the end, the tacos were well worth it. The hypnotically smooth sound of Yellow Days could be heard and seen on the Dia De Los Puercos Stage from the taco line.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tropicalia featured performances that reminded the Latinx audience of family barbeques and birthdays in the park. Celso Pino and Sonora Dinamata, musical staples in the cumbia world, entertained the younger crowd with nostalgia while attracting older audiences to revel in their presence. Cuco, 18-year-old singer from L.A., captured the hearts of the young and old crowd with his modern take on Spanish love songs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tropicalia also highlighted many indie bands, including Slow Hollows, Inner Wave and Bane’s World, who recently performed at the KCSB Courtyard, on the intimate Mota Stage. Performing at their first festival, Inner Wave experimented with funky synth sounds and guitar licks, completely jamming out before playing their hits. Long Beach native Bane’s World concluded the night at Mota Stage with their signature dreamy and sentimental sound. The small but loyal crowd was left hungry for more after the set was cut short.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As the sunset illuminated the Tropicalia stage and San Pedro Bay in an orange hue, the headliners began their sets. Café Tacvba, a renowned rock band from Mexico City, played a delightfully eclectic set that was paired with multiple outlandish outfit changes. The Spanish-speaking crowd emotionally sang along as they performed the romantic lyrics of “Como Te Extraño Mi Amor.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">King Krule was next. The sky was now dark and the crowd had anxiously formed around the stage waiting for the English rock sensation. With the release of his new album, <i>The OOZ</i>, followers were excited to hear songs off the album as well as classics like “Baby Blue” and “Easy Easy.” The stage went dark; King Krule stepped on stage with navy lights highlighting his silhouette. Emotionally rich, electrifying and riveting to the core is how we would describe the set, as the audience could feel the passion in his voice.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kali Uchis followed the energy of King Krule, delivering a truly sensational performance and touching the culture of the audience with her Latina prowess. Notably, she asked the crowd to raise their hands if they spoke Spanish, and 90 percent of the crowd proceeded to raise their hands. In Spanish and English she enchanted the crowd with her harmonic, jazz-like voice before humbly thanking and praising the crowd.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The next band truly embodied the essence of Tropicalia Fest, blending in rich Chicanx-culture storytelling with their psychedelic soul and funk heavy rock. Chicano Batman, native to L.A., was an emotional high point for many in the crowd. The politically empowering lyrics about the Mexican-American experience paired with their incredibly psychedelic visuals truly made an unforgettable experience.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For its first year, Tropicalia was a success. From its packed lineup to completely sold-out tickets, Tropicalia created a festival that celebrated the Latin American/Chicanx culture that allowed for this artistry to thrive. Whether you belonged to this cultural identity or not, the people were welcoming in the celebration of the organic culture they had created. Although the amazing performances made the day possible, Tropicalia was truly much more than that. Considering the impressiveness of its first year, one can only guess what will come next for this young festival.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79798\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79798\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/tropicalia-fest-opens-in-long-beach-with-a-splash/","id":6682,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[6681,6680,6679],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Biko House: Punks, Progressives and Politics","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Performing Art","publish_date":"2017-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Time and time again, the Biko House has opened the doors of its black and brown empire for the community to discuss important racial events in the United States. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">In September of 2005, the <i>Nexus</i> released an article titled “The Rise of the Biko Empire,” praising the recent influx of, as it described, a “wave of artsy combustion from soft white underbellies” in their garage venue. Most of the article describes the orchestrated chaos brought on by unique and flamboyant bands in 2005.</div>\n</div>\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The ending of the article caught my attention, as it asked readers the question, “What’s in store for the future of the Biko House?” Even though I believe the question refers to Biko’s musical scene, I don’t think the writer or any student in 2005 for that matter could have predicted how our world would be today.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I do not want to dive into the details of the United States’ current socio-political climate, but if you don’t know already, it’s bad. It has probably always been bad and my younger self just didn’t take notice. It might have been because politicians were more into dog-whistle politics than directly saying absurd, problematic things out loud. But whatever the reason, Biko’s empire has risen to the occasion and become more than just a musical empire. Keep in mind that my use of the word “empire” isn’t insinuating a single authoritarian rule but, rather, an expansive, all-encompassing multi-faceted entity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79633\" style=\"width: 2071px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"686434280\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79632\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79633\" data-attachment-id=\"79633\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/unnamed-1-17/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=2061%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2061,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=888%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79633\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=888%2C555\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=2061&amp;ssl=1 2061w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79633\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Biko was established to be a safe space for POC in a predominantly white institution, but it has evolved to become an empire of social change, music and solidarity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Time and time again, Biko has opened the doors of its black and brown empire for the community to discuss important racial happenings, like those from 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After the racially charged incidents that occurred at the University of Missouri, Biko’s Garage was open to UCSB faculty and staff, students and local residents to discuss and stand in solidarity with the Mizzou protests. After the recent unfoldings of the presidential election, BIKO has served as an oasis of peace. Activism can be tiring, not just physically but mentally; sometimes that’s not something one wishes to bring back home. Many of Biko’s residents participated and continue participating in progressive work outside of the house.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Biko Garage, Isla Vista’s rectangular punk haven, is a cement room with capacity for maybe three and a half cars, or, on Friday night, 30 or so college kids with adrenaline to burn. Sound bled from the squat building as I approached it last weekend, my heart already in sync with the bass drum’s boom. “Wait!” called my friends, whom I’d started to outpace, but my legs wouldn’t listen. Biko zoomed up in front of us: two adjoined garages, one of which was closed but pulsing with noise; the other serving as a merch tent/lounge where some kids were hanging out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Drawing up to a table on which sat some flyers, a jar stuffed with dirty dollar bills and a pair of hairy forearms, I fished a $20 bill from my pocket and slapped it down, with maybe a bit too much gusto, as the owner of the forearms raised his eyebrows and gave me change. I stuffed the remaining $5 bills into the jar, and together we walked to the door, which was shaking. I gripped the greasy doorknob, turned it and leaned in. The four of us walked into the sun. We surfaced for air, joining the crush of people that had migrated outside, waiting for Genocide Jack. The crowd was, as a whole, black-shirted, lip-pierced and grinning—couple of camo swatches, a spark of Day-Glo hair.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During a particularly raucous song of the band’s set, lead singer Brian Bellrose crossed the invisible line between stage and stands, whirling around and bouncing off his fans. The zone surrounded me, a pink punk mist. Nothing else mattered. The only distinction between Bellrose and the people who’d paid $5 to see him was the mic, and even that he gave away, giving literal voice to anyone with something to scream. Most of it was indecipherable, but the message was clear, loud and nonverbal: energy so vicious that it’s often misconstrued as anger. This conclusion is evidenced by punk performers’ offstage impressions — I’ve never met one who was anything but gracious, progressive and kind. That night was no exception.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After a rousing performance of the Beastie Boys’ “Fight For Your Right,” accompanied by much floor-thrashing, crowd-singing and a heartfelt thank-you from the band, the show was over, and we tumbled back into the night, dazed and a little confused.</p>\n<p>Music, art and activism are what is brewed up in Biko. To continue to stand by its message, Biko additionally tries to prioritize women of color and POC musical performers, but it still opens its doors to everyone. We have seen the future of Biko that was conceptualized back in 2005, and it’s beautiful. Effervescent, colorful, strong and full of spirit; whether it’s the music pumping out of the garage or a presentation on vegetarian inclusiveness, Biko has become a platform for those without platforms.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79632\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79632\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/","id":6486,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[6485,6484,6483],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The xx Transcends Expectations at Santa Barbara Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The xx truly grabbed and held onto the energy and enthusiasm of the crowd the whole time.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Do you know the feeling when you’re carefree, living your life all summer and you forget that school is still a thing?

The crowd was predominantly late 20s and up, and I felt like a lost child at a concert compared to everyone else. I had a slightly rough time walking up the notorious Santa Barbara Bowl slope, and the visibly intoxicated crowd was also complaining about the hike up, making it a communal struggle.</p>\n<p>I arrived at my seat sweaty and sore, greeted by the familiar white-haired ushers and Bowl workers, who are always so kind. I had missed the opener, Perfume Genius, but a father and son sitting behind me were more than happy to share their thoughts. Concertgoer Arley Sakai said, “Spotify recommended [Perfume Genius] for me; I’ve never considered seeing them in concert … it was quite the live performance, very flamboyant and vivacious.” He explained how he had grown up listening to The xx, as his parents would play their music in the car often, and it was the minimalistic sound that really grabbed his attention.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Sitting there, I began to notice that the crowd was well into their 40s and 50s, with the GA pit looking more like they were in their 20s or 30s.

I could tell by the simple but equally elaborate stage setup that the visuals were going to be amazing. My impatience grew, so I went to withdraw cash to purchase a churro after seeing other people munching on theirs.</p>\n<p>The xx began their set, of course, with “Intro,” from their debut LP. Nostalgia rushed over me as I witnessed them perform the song that had initially brought them to my attention after hearing it on the movie “Project X.” The talented guitarist and vocalist, Romy Madley Croft, began the intro riff to “Crystalised,” and the crowd immediately responded with cheers of joy. Similar to their music style, all three members were clad in dark, simple and aesthetic sweaters, leather jackets and jeans.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Producer and DJ Jamie xx made his talent on the stage clear when they began to play “Say Something Loving’’ from their junior album.

The xx truly grabbed and held onto the energy and enthusiasm of the crowd the whole time. The visuals transformed from monochrome to colorful displays, seemingly matching the tone of the songs playing and creating a cinematic experience throughout the Bowl. The guitar riffs, groovy bass and dream-like beats created an unforgettable atmosphere; the emotion and happiness of the crowd was at a level I had never witnessed before.</p>\n<p>The xx continued to entrance the crowd with songs off all three albums and their minimal stylistic visuals that provided an optical spectacle. Six mirror prisms rotated and lit up accordingly with the style of the song. At one point, Sim stepped off the stage, seemingly ending the show, only to reveal Jamie xx playing one of his solo songs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78969\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"876541609\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79018\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78969\" data-attachment-id=\"78969\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/thexx-by-jenny-luo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TheXX by Jenny Luo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78969\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78969\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Between the encore of “On Hold” and “Angels,” the group took a minute to announce that a dollar of each ticket sale was going to Pacific Pride.

Season 1 Episode 2, “Parents,” hit home for many first-generation American viewers, including myself, as protagonist Dev Shah, played by Aziz Ansari, explores the history of his parent’s experiences as immigrants in the United States. Season 1 of “Master of None” received much praise for the fresh storytelling and day-to-day humor of Dev’s life as he finds love and navigates through his 30s in New York. To my own and others’ rejoice, Ansari reprised his role as Dev in Season 2 of “Master of None.” The long-awaited second season once again wowed viewers with new expositions, social commentary, a killer soundtrack and “Atlanta” style casual humor.</p>\n<p>In Ansari’s own version of “Under the Tuscan Sun,” the season begins with Dev living in Italy and learning the ways of pasta-making after breaking up with his love interest from Season 1. The cinematography almost identically follows the classic black-and-white Italian film “The Bike Thief.” Dev anxiously searches Modena, Italy, in an attempt to find the person who stole his phone, with even more pressure to retrieve the newly acquired number of a beautiful British girl he met that day. The stupendously pleasing black-and-white scenes nicely blend with the predominantly Italian-spoken episode, a language which Ansari actually learned how to speak proficiently while researching the script for Season 2. Something noteworthy about the show is how Dev’s character strays far from the typical Indian TV-show archetype. Throughout television history, countless minority men, especially those with Asian backgrounds, have been desexualized and portrayed as weak, awkward individuals, or they’re solely in background roles such as corner store clerks, as seen in the show “Big Bang Theory,” for example.</p>\n<p>False representations of Asian men in media has led to many real life repercussions and the development of negative stereotypes. It’s extremely refreshing to see a show in which minority characters break away from stereotypical archetypes and thrive in roles not traditional to their ethnicities.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Aside from breaking typical minority archetypes, “Master of None” oh-so-beautifully plays on cultural traditions and experiences. The episode “Religion” examines Dev’s experiences as a Muslim-American as he balances both cultures with his preferences and that of his parents. For Dev, it’s his taste for pork and other non-Islamic habits that conflicts with his mother’s wishes for him to strictly follow Islam, or at least act like he does among extended family. Viewers from any religion or background can share Dev’s experience of what it feels like to diverge from your parents’ idealized expectations  and dealing with the fallout of having them face that reality. Nonetheless, Dev comes to terms with his mother’s wishes. Although he may not be who she wanted him to be, he still mostly respects his mother’s traditions and beliefs in her presence.</p>\n<p>Aside from following the life of Dev and his journey for love, “Master of None” does an incredible job at seamlessly including narratives about unconventional characters. The “Thanksgiving” episode follows the coming-out experience of Dev’s longtime friend Denise over a series of hilarious Thanksgiving dinners that are embodied with the music and style of the year during which they take place. The episode highlights pivotal moments in Denise’s coming-of-age story, from the start of Denise’s rebellion against her mother’s proposed frilly dresses to the moment her mother comes to accept Denise’s sexuality and welcomes Denise’s girlfriend. The show does an excellent job at highlighting the experience of Denise’s progression with her sexuality as well as the pressure that Denise faces when coming out as a queer woman of color. Her mother is especially troubled by the fact that Denise’s life will become harder as a queer woman of color, perhaps more so than if she were just a lesbian. The episode is full of nostalgic and humorous family anecdotes, my favorite being Denise’s mother’s explanation of what a minority is to young Dev and Denise after Denise finds out Dev is Indian and not black.</p>\n<p>Another favorite episode plays out like what you would expect an episode of “Humans of New York” would be like. All intertwined through a series of random encounters, the episode puts a spotlight on the life of different individuals of different socioeconomic, racial and handicapped groups. From a deaf couple signing their intimacy issues in a mute but hilariously played out conversation to doormen who witness and deal with all the drama that unfolds among the buildings tenants, the episode finishes with a couple of Rwandan taxi drivers just trying to look for a wild night out in the city. Ansari and other writers do an outstanding job of showing the lives of background and typically sidelined characters, the real humans of New York: the working class, non-glamorized New Yorkers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78255\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1558006261\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78253\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78255\" data-attachment-id=\"78255\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/drink2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?fit=440%2C913&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"440,913\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"drink2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?fit=120%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?fit=440%2C913&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78255\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?resize=440%2C913\" alt=\"\" width=\"440\" height=\"913\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?w=440&amp;ssl=1 440w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drink2.jpg?resize=120%2C250&amp;ssl=1 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78255\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Son / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Like cookie without milk or peanut butter without jelly, the show without its perfect soundtrack would leave something missing for viewers. “Master of None” understands how most modern-day viewers consume music; we fit it with our mood, with the moment and where we are. Similar to how we all have that friend who knows what song will perfectly fit the moment, “Master of None” is that friend. In “Thanksgiving,” the music is what sets the ‘90s setting, with “Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like That)” in the intro to submerge viewers into the nostalgia of ‘90s rap jazz beats. Dev’s moment of childhood rebellion when he takes a bite of bacon despite his mother’s orders is righteously accompanied by Tupac’s “Only God Can Judge Me.” That moment of perilous contemplation that we have all experienced, when Dev sits in the back of an Uber thinking about the dreadful reality that he’s in love with an engaged woman, is melancholically paired with “Say Hello, Wave Goodbye.” With music being the final piece in the puzzle, Ansari develops a show that is simply real.</p>\n<p>As the quarter comes to an end and finals approach, cramming goes into full force and the library is filled to the brim. It’s important to remember that the most effective way to retain information is with 45 to 50-minute study intervals and 15-minute breaks. If you don’t wish to lose your table in those 15 minutes, consider watching half an episode of “Master of None.” Allow yourself to fall in love with the Italian countryside, the lives of average New Yorkers or a witty and lovable Dev Shah. The show does everything it aims to so well, and yet it doesn’t focus on just one thing. It reflects on growing up, love, music and family, but it also doubles as a comedy and drama. This show is truly a jack of all trades, but not a master of none.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78253\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78253\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/master-of-none-makes-a-triumphant-return/","id":5783,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[5782,5781,5780],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/674"}},"__N_SSG":true}
