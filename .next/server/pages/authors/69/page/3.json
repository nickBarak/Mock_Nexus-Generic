Trailing 7-2, junior Andrew Riminton and red shirt sophomore Morgan Mays battled back to 7-6 before falling in the next set on court three. As court one stood at a stalemate 6-6, the Red Raiders took a second victory on court two over Galskov and sophomore Teague Hamilton 8-4. Texas Tech headed into singles play leading 1-0.</p>\n<p>The Red Raiders took another big jump on the Gauchos taking the first two singles matches of the day. No. 123 sophomore Jolan Cailleau defeated freshman Cody Rakela in straight sets of 6-2. Mays nearly forced a third set against No. 117 freshman Alex Sendegeya, but was defeated 6-3, 7-5. Texas Tech went up 3-0, in need of just one more win, and play was suspended due to rainfall.</p>\n<p>Just under an hour later, play resumed and the Gauchos began to make a stand. Sophomore Erik Johnsson put UCSB on the board taking a victory on court five in straight sets. Johnsson defeated his opponent, senior Francisco Zambon, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). Junior Nathan Eshmade was the next to keep the Gauchos alive on court two. He took down junior Hugo Dojas after forcing a third set 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.</p>\n<p>Down just 3-2, UCSB needed victories from both Galskov and Hamilton. Hamilton fought hard on court six losing the first set 6-7(4-7) to freshman Connor Curry. He found himself trailing just 4-5 in the second, looking to force a third set, but his match was called off due to the finish on court one.</p>\n<p>Galskov took on No. 37 junior Felipe Soares and forced him to a third set as they split the first two 4-6, 6-3. The junior Red Raider solidified his team’s spot in the next round taking the third set 6-1 over Galskov.</p>\n<p>“I know the team is very good right now and we’ve progressed so much this year,” Galskov said. “I think they can do a lot of great things next year.”</p>\n<p>This match concludes UCSB’s season.

The Gauchos defeated both Hawaii and UC Davis to make it to the final, where they topped UC Irvine 4-3 to hoist the trophy.</p>\n<p>With three wins in the tournament, Santa Barbara improves to an overall record of 15-9 and extends its win streak to four straight.</p>\n<p>The first match of the tournament for the three-seeded Gauchos came against the sixth-seeded Hawaii Rainbow Warriors. Earlier in the regular season, Santa Barbara downed Hawaii at home 6-1, and on this past Thursday, it put on a similar performance. The Gauchos took a 4-0 victory and play was stopped for resting purposes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos started off the day battling with the Warriors in the doubles point. Hawaii grabbed a quick win on court three and needed just one more doubles victory to go up 1-0. The senior duo of Ziad Sultan and Tobias Galskov evened the score up with their 6-3 victory on court two. The Gauchos were then able to capture the doubles point with a 6-4 win on the number one court by junior Nathan Eshmade and sophomore Erik Johnsson.</p>\n<p>With a 1-0 victory, the Gauchos moved on to the singles round and took three straight set victories on the lower courts to seal the 4-0 win. On court four, freshman Cody Rakela took a 6-3, 6-4 victory and Johnsson finished with the same score on court five. Sophomore Teague Hamilton took the last win with ease 6-1, 6-1 on court six. With this win, the Gauchos looked ahead to a rematch with second-seeded UC Davis.</p>\n<p>The Aggies beat out the Gauchos in their regular season matchup just a few weeks ago by a close score of 4-3 in Davis. The story was much different this time around when the two teams met at in this neutral setting, and Santa Barbara took a 4-1 win to advance to the final round.</p>\n<p>In the doubles round, UCSB once again showed its dominance as all three doubles teams held leads, and the wins came down to who could finish first. The duo of Eshmade and Johnsson added a 6-3 win and a 6-4 victory from sophomore Morgan Mays and junior Andrew Riminton sealed the point. Galskova and Sultan were stopped with a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos again took some help from their players on the lower courts when they headed into the singles round. Hamilton and Johnsson added victories for the second straight day to put their team up 3-0 over the Aggies. Hamilton won 6-2, 7-6 on court six and Johnsson triumphed in three sets on court five 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.</p>\n<p>Galskov, reclaiming his spot on court one, ended the match and sent his team to final round to take on the first seeded UC Irvine Anteaters with a straight set win of 6-3, 6-2.</p>\n<p>In the final match of the Big West Tournament, UCSB would again get a chance to beat a team that downed them during the regular season by the close score of 4-3. The Gauchos got their revenge, delivering the Eaters a 4-3 loss and bringing the Big West title back to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started off the finals match just as they had done the previous two, with a win in the doubles round. Eshmade and Johnsson grabbed the first match easily on court one with a score of 6-2, but the Eaters were able to take away the match on court three. The senior captains, Sultan and Galskov, came through for their team with a 6-4 win that put UCSB up 1-0.</p>\n<p>Singles play faired the Gauchos in the earlier part of the day as the team quickly took control of match. Freshman Cody Rakela added his second singles win of the tournament in straight sets of 7-6, 6-4 on court four. Johnsson fell early losing his first set 6-0, but battled back to win the next two 6-2, 6-3 on court five. These two wins put the team up 3-0 and the victory seemed inevitable.</p>\n<p>With just one more win needed, the Gauchos dropped singles matches on courts one, three, and six, and Irvine was right back in the game tying the score at 3-3. The match and the title came down to Eshmade playing on court two. The junior from Australia was downed 6-7 in the first set and needed the next two to win the tournament for his team.

As the third seed in the competition, the Gauchos will first take on Hawaii in the quarterfinal round.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished off their season last weekend collecting a 12-9 overall record and a 3-2 record in conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is heading into this tournament with some momentum from the second half of the season, having won nine of its last 12 matches. The last of these regular season battles came last Saturday, where the team nearly swept then-No. 50 Cal Poly 6-1 to earn the Blue-Green rivalry victory.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This win also put UCSB at a 9-0 home record, making it the first team in school history to achieve an undefeated home standing.</p>\n<p>“I can tell you that we will be one of the fittest teams down there and that will go far for us,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “It’s our tradition to prepare that way and we’ve won a few titles because of it. Our guys really bought into this year, and I think it will help separate us.”</p>\n<p>The fitness of every player on every team will be tested at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden located in Palm Springs. The massive facility, although enjoyed by many players, features all outdoor courts in the desert’s 110-plus-degree weather.</p>\n<p>The path to the championship is already laid out for the Gauchos, who will first take on Hawaii. Beating the Rainbow Warriors would put the Gauchos in a match with second-seeded UC Davis, and a win there would drop them off in the final round, likely with the number-one seeded UC Irvine or the four seeded Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos faced Hawaii earlier this season, it was a very one-sided event. The Gauchos took the victory by a score of 6-1 over the visiting Rainbow Warriors, sweeping the doubles point and taking five of six in the singles game. All of the singles victors won in straight sets as well, including freshman Cody Rakela’s impressive 6-1, 6-1, performance.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos advance today, a rematch with UC Davis awaits them in the semifinals. Davis is just what the Gauchos have in mind coming into this event, despite losing the regular season match 4-3. UCSB was the visitor in this matchup and nearly ruined the perfect home season for the Aggies. The action was tied at 3-3 and the Aggies managed to save triple match point to give them the slight advantage over the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>A win in the tournament would give UCSB its ninth conference championship and an automatic bid into the NCAA Tournament where the team would make its 11th appearance.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to carry the momentum from this great season with us to the tournament,” senior captain Ziad Sultan explained. “We’re hot right now and [when] we go down there, we’re bringing the fire.”</p>\n<p>The team’s first match starts today at 9 a.m. With a win, the Gauchos will play UC Davis at 3 p.m. Friday. The final round is set to start Sunday morning at 9 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 23, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62699\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/mens-tennis-carries-momentum-into-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62699\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/mens-tennis-carries-momentum-into-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/mens-tennis-carries-momentum-into-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/mens-tennis-carries-momentum-into-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/mens-tennis-carries-momentum-into-big-west-tournament/","id":125,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[124,123,122],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Morgan Mays: Dedication From a Young Age","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Since transferring to UCSB from Wake Forest, the Malibu native has been one of the key players in the Gauchos’ run to history","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62661\" style=\"width: 279px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.2-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"86594438\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62698\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62661\" data-attachment-id=\"62661\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/morgan-mays-dedication-from-a-young-age/morgan-mays-prepares-to-return-the-ball-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.2-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Morgan Mays prepares to return the ball.

Top prospects in tennis gain their rankings and reputation from playing in tournaments and tours, so traveling year round is a necessity.</p>\n<p>To make himself known, Mays had to be truly dedicated. He had to sacrifice attending a public high school, instead attending online to allow him to pursue his love of the sport.</p>\n<p>Luckily, he was able to get a taste of the high school sports experience beforehand due to his undeniable talent. While in just the sixth grade, his first year of middle school, Mays earned a varsity letter competing for Trinity Preparatory High School.</p>\n<p>He found homes in both Florida and California, so moving around all ends of the nation wasn’t unfamiliar. In Florida, he tacked on the accolade of being ranked No. 1 in the state for players 16 and under, and defended that rank with a victory in the Florida State Singles Championship.</p>\n<p>As he traveled, Mays achieved such accomplishments as being labeled a 5-Star recruit, winning three ITF junior singles titles and an ITF junior doubles title. Along with that, he was ranked top-10 nationally throughout his entire junior career in his age group. As his game grew and progressed over this time, the idea of college life came closer and closer.</p>\n<p>“When I was playing at a younger age I hadn’t really thought too much about college,” Mays said. “I was just trying to get better and hit the rankings, but when it came down to deciding on a school, I held education and tennis as my highest priorities.”</p>\n<p>Mays decided to take his talents to Wake Forest University in North Carolina; a university which is well respected for both its academics and its tennis play. During his time there, the Demon Deacons sat in the top-20 of the rankings all season.</p>\n<p>Mays posted a 9-5 overall singles record and helped contribute to a 6-4 stand in doubles play. He found his spot primarily around the fifth and sixth courts, which, although they weren’t the most glamorous spots, are still beyond impressive for a late addition freshman on highly-ranked ACC team.</p>\n<p>“Wake Forest was definitely the right decision for me at that time,” Mays explained. “It was a really great and rare opportunity and I definitely enjoyed it. The academics were great, the people were very friendly, and the adjustment was pretty smooth. On top of that, they have a very successful tennis program and it was great playing in the ACC.”</p>\n<p>Despite enjoying his time as a Deacon and contributing to their elite team, Mays had his sights set on other destinations to pursue success. He searched for a place with a chance to experience his own improvement as an individual while still contributing to the team.</p>\n<p>“I think team success is great and it actually can strongly relate to individual success, so it is definitely important,” Mays said. “I experienced that at Wake Forest and now I was looking for fair opportunity to play higher up so I could have a chance to play in national circuits while still playing for a team.”</p>\n<p>Being a California native, and perhaps a little worn out by the climate change of North Carolina, Mays wanted to return to the West Coast to compete on the court. UCSB presented itself as a strong competitor for his new destination as he still considered the option of returning to Wake Forest.</p>\n<p>After learning of Santa Barbara’s divine Film and Media Studies program, which matched his interest of study, Mays decided to return to the Golden State, just miles from his home in Malibu.</p>\n<p>“The college experience at Santa Barbara speaks for itself, the location speaks for itself and the academics speak for themselves too,” Mays said. “On top of that, the tennis program is very successful and [Head Coach Marty Davis] is a phenomenal coach that has helped many players climb to the next step in the sport.”</p>\n<p>When Mays became a Gaucho just this past season, the opportunities that he had searched for came alive as he found himself playing around the top three spots and mostly holding down the number one spot for his team. He contributed to 11 doubles victories and posted a 13-7 singles record that featured a nine-match win streak.</p>\n<p>Mays’ successes helped push Santa Barbara to a very successful season as the Gauchos climbed as high as No. 60 in the rankings and finished the regular season sitting at No. 62. With a 9-0 home record, they even made history by becoming the first UCSB men’s tennis team to go undefeated at home for the entire regular season.</p>\n<p>“I’m so glad that I was able to come to this amazing school and help this program thrive,” Mays said.  “I love the team already and I think we have all of the tools to keep pushing and become a top-30 team in the nation. I would love to see that happen in my time here and hope our success keeps growing.”</p>\n<p>Morgan Mays, a true competitor in the sport of tennis, has found a home at the University of California at Santa Barbara and will undoubtedly continue to strive for success as he always has in his career.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of April 23, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/morgan-mays-dedication-from-a-young-age/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/morgan-mays-dedication-from-a-young-age/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/morgan-mays-dedication-from-a-young-age/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/morgan-mays-dedication-from-a-young-age/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/morgan-mays-dedication-from-a-young-age/","id":127,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[126,125,124],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Defeats Cal Poly, Makes History","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With Saturday's win, the Gauchos accomplished something that the program has never done before","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62585\" style=\"width: 232px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.5-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1705450025\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62589\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62585\" data-attachment-id=\"62585\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/mens-tennis-defeats-cal-poly-makes-history/ziad-sultan-returns-the-ball-to-his-opponent-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.5-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Ziad Sultan returns the ball to his opponent.

The Gauchos dropped the first on court one giving the Mustangs the edge, needing just one more win to clinch.</p>\n<p>The duo of red shirt sophomore Morgan Mays and junior Andrew Riminton found themselves down 4-1 to start off on court three and battled their way back to force a tie breaker. They kept the doubles point alive winning six of the last seven sets for a 7-5 victory. The team of junior Nathan Eshmade and sophomore Erik Johnsson secured the doubles point in similar fashion, winning 7-5 on court two.</p>\n<p>​“I don’t know what happened to get down and I don’t know what happened [to] get back up either,” Mays explained. “[Riminton] and I just kept playing the next point, because that what he and I have done all season.”</p>\n<p>​The Gauchos took the singles matches by storm winning five of the six total matches, but the score doesn’t do justice to how close the match was. Three sets went to a tie breaker and two matches went down to the third set.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Teague Hamilton was the first to finish for his team winning in straight sets 6-1, 6-2, on court six. Freshman Cody Rakela was the next to go with his quick victory of 6-3, 6-4, to put the Gauchos up 3-0, just one match away from making history.</p>\n<p>​Eshmade was defeated on court two in straight sets by Garrett Auproux, giving Cal Poly its first point of the match. Galskov and Johnsson each won their first sets, but lost in the second set to keep the Mustangs in it.</p>\n<p>As these two matches entered the third set, Mays looked to close out the match in the second on court three after taking the first set in an intense 7-6 battle.</p>\n<p>​Mays was faced with the tough challenge of Poly’s 6’5 Corey Pang, who covers the front of the net, but still found a way to fire returns past him. Mays took the second set 6-3 and his teammates rushed the court as he sealed their spot in history. With a score of 4-1, and wins from Galskov and Johnsson to follow, the Gauchos improved to 9-0 at home.</p>\n<p>​“This is a match that I think we really needed to win,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “All the guys who won today are going to have confidence heading in the Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>​The team’s season is not over yet as UCSB will head to Indian Wells next week for the Big West Conference Tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62589\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/mens-tennis-defeats-cal-poly-makes-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62589\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/mens-tennis-defeats-cal-poly-makes-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/mens-tennis-defeats-cal-poly-makes-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/mens-tennis-defeats-cal-poly-makes-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/mens-tennis-defeats-cal-poly-makes-history/","id":122,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[121,120,119],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 65 Men’s Tennis Looks To Make History at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"One more win and the Gauchos will accomplish something that no team in the program's history has before","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62440\" style=\"width: 264px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_10-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"787300488\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62435\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62440\" data-attachment-id=\"62440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/andrew-riminton-and-morgan-mays-stand-ready-to-play-sam-aragondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_10-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.2\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Andrew Riminton and Morgan Mays stand ready to play.

With an outstanding home record of 8-0, this year’s team has the chance to go undefeated at home for the first time.</p>\n<p>After a shaky road trip, a win over the Mustangs could give the Gauchos the momentum they need heading to the Big West Conference Tournament next week.</p>\n<p>It would also be the perfect way to send off team captains, seniors Ziad Sultan and Tobias Galskov, who will be playing in their final match in Santa Barbara. With the two long-time Gauchos making their last home stand, Saturday’s match will also play host to the Senior Day celebration.</p>\n<p>UCSB has found its success in its depth as a team and each player’s ability to adapt to whatever challenges that Head Coach Marty Davis presents to them. Whether it is hopping into the doubles lineup with a new partner, or going from playing the number three court to the number one court, these Gauchos have handled all adversity with poise and success.</p>\n<p>Junior Nathan Eshmade has played as low as four on the order of the courts this season, and due to a recent hot streak, the junior has been bumped up to the number one court and has brought his team victory despite the big jump.</p>\n<p>Mays, who just got off of a nine-match singles win streak, has played around the top of the lineup all year. The depth and adaptability has helped this team progress in that each player can rely on every teammate to do his job despite the workload.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been hot in this latter part of the season having won eight of their last eleven matches. They even found their rhythm on the road going 3-3 in that last stretch, after starting off the season 0-6. UCSB is playing its best tennis of the season at the perfect time with the postseason just around the corner, but Cal Poly could very well put a damper on it, as it is not a team to take lightly.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs are in position to take first place in the Big West conference standings and currently lead the other Big West teams in ranking as they sit at No. 49 nationally. They recently held a five-match win streak before falling 5-2 to the current Big West leader, UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match in Santa Barbara will be the Mustangs’ last regular season match of the year as well, and they will be looking to spoil the show for the Gauchos and reach a higher seeding for the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The blue-green rivalry will be renewed this Saturday at 3:00 p.m. at the Rec Cen Courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/no-65-mens-tennis-looks-to-make-history-at-home/","id":980,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[979,978,977],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Pacific, Drops Two Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The doubles point was all-important in the Gauchos last three matches","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62312\" style=\"width: 2787px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis15-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"982205452\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62375\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62312\" data-attachment-id=\"62312\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/2-1-15christinademarzomenstennis15-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis15-web.jpg?fit=2777%2C4166&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2777,4166\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Morgan Mays hits the ball across the net to his opponent.

At a 2-0 record in conference and a 7-0 record at home, the Aggies would not take anything less than a win to cap off the season undefeated in Davis.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Aggies started off the match on a good note by beating the Gauchos in the doubles competition. The Gaucho pair of seniors Tobias Galskov and Ziad Sultan was defeated 6-2 while the duo of junior Nathan Eshmade and sophomore Erik Johnsson fell 6-4. The Aggies took a 1-0 lead, meaning the Gauchos would need four singles victories to claim the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly tied the match with a one-sided win from sophomore Morgan Mays, playing on court three. Mays took his eighth singles victory in a row, winning in straight sets of 6-2, 6-0 to put UCSB on the board 1-1.</p>\n<p>Freshman Cody Rakela was the next to finish and his win gave his team a 2-1 advantage in the match. Rakela defeated his opponent on court four in straight sets of 6-4, 6-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were in need of two more singles victories to take the conference match, but fell just short, as only sophomore Teague Hamilton was able to add a win for Santa Barbara. Galskov, coming off of injury was unable to find his rhythm on court one and was defeated in straight sets. Hamilton battled through three sets and won 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 on the sixth court, but it was not enough as the Aggies took the slim victory 4-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB got off to a better start Sunday morning at UOP as Mays and his partner junior Andrew Riminton took a 6-2 win on court three to begin doubles play. The Tigers tied it up on court one and the doubles point came down to Eshmade and Johnsson on court two. In a tie break, the Gaucho duo took a 7-6 win to put their team up 1-0.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Pacific split the singles matchups 3-3 to give Santa Barbara a 4-3 win – just the team’s third on the road this season. The three wins from the Gaucho side came from the same three in the earlier match with Davis.</p>\n<p>Hamilton added his second straight win of the road trip with his straight set victory on the sixth court. He was the first to finish, winning 6-5, 6-2 and put his team up 2-0. Mays followed just after with his 6-3, 6-4 victory. This win extended his singles match streak to nine straight wins and moved him back up to the second spot on the roster.</p>\n<p>Rakela was the one to seal the match for the Gauchos with his hard fought victory on court one. The freshman took the first set 6-4 before being bested in the second 3-6. In the third and final set, Rakela blew by his opponent 6-1 to ensure the Gauchos a victory on this long trip.</p>\n<p>The final match of this road trip was all too familiar at this point in the weekend for UCSB. Once again the Gauchos found themselves in a match decided by one point, and fell 4-3 to a hot Fresno State team. The Bulldogs capitalized on the doubles point and UCSB split the singles matches for the third straight time.</p>\n<p>“It was a tough loss,” Mays said. “But they were a very tough team. It goes to show you how important the doubles point is.”</p>\n<p>Eshmade, who struggled in the two matches prior, finally found his feet while playing away and grabbed a win on the number one court. He took a one-sided victory in straight sets of 6-1, 6-2 to give his team some hope for the overall win.</p>\n<p>Down 3-1 in the match, both Johnsson and Hamilton added wins to the UCSB scoreboard to tie it at 3-3. They both won in straight sets as well going 6-2, 6-1, and 6-3, 6-4, respectively.</p>\n<p>The match came down to the number four court where Rakela found himself down 1-0 and already losing the second set. The freshman battled back to force a tie breaker in the second but was edged out 6-7 to give the Bulldogs the home victory.</p>\n<p>“It’s the last part of the season so this is what matters now,” Mays said. “We just need to step up. We are all really pumped for Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will return home this Saturday to renew the Blue-Green Rivalry against a tough No. 49 Cal Poly team. The Gauchos, who currently stand at 8-0 at home, will be looking to become the first team in school history to post an undefeated home season. The action is set to start at 2 pm at the Rec Cen courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62375\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62375\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/","id":978,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[977,976,975],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Remains Undefeated at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos handed losses to New Mexico State and UC Riverside to improve to a perfect 8-0 at home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62018\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_04-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1012506095\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62037\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62018\" data-attachment-id=\"62018\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/mens-tennis-remains-undefeated-at-home/morgan-mays-gets-ready-to-return-the-ball-sam-aragondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_04-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.8\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Morgan Mays gets ready to return the ball.

Johnsson has personally thrived on his home courts as well, only losing one singles match at home this season.</p>\n<p>The match with New Mexico State was ultimately decided by the doubles point, which the Gauchos won to start off the match 2-1. The team of senior Ziad Sultan and sophomore Teague Hamilton took the first victory 6-1 to put the team one win away from the first point. The duo of Johnsson and junior Nathan Eshmade sealed the deal with a 6-2 victory that put the Gauchos up 1-0.</p>\n<p>The singles matches were split right the down the middle 3-3 which gave the Gauchos a 4-3 win overall. Among the Gauchos who were able to grab a singles victory was Eshmade, playing in the number one spot for the first time this season. Just a few weeks prior to this match he was commonly filling the third and fourth spot, but has stepped up for his team winning every match since early February. The junior did not disappoint by any means as he was able to take a straight set win 6-1, 6-1.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been playing some unbelievable volley tennis lately and Coach has really been noticing it,” Eshmade explained. “Guys haven’t been able to handle it lately, and I’ve been able to really build on top of my game as I go through this season.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore Morgan Mays added a second victory for UCSB on court three. Mays struggled early on the first set as he fell behind 2-0, but was able to bounce back and take the set 6-3. The second set was even closer as Mays had to win in with a tiebreaker, 7-5.</p>\n<p>Hamilton was another Gaucho to take a singles victory with his straight set victory. He took an easy win in the first set 6-3 and then was forced to a tie-breaker in the second. Hamilton battled his way to a 7-6 victory which clinched the win for the Gauchos in this match.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s match with conference opponent UC Riverside was much more one-sided, but, nonetheless, important for UCSB which came in with a 1-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>The team started off the same way as they did Saturday, taking the all-important doubles point. The same teams would be responsible as well with a victory 6-2 from Sultan and Hamilton and a 6-1 win from Eshmade and Johnsson.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been really working on our doubles play lately, and it’s starting to get really strong,” junior Andrew Riminton said. “You can see how much we’ve improved from prior matches and we’re looking really solid right now on that end.”</p>\n<p>Riminton himself, alongside partner Mays, battled in both of their doubles matches this weekend. Although they were stopped early in both outings, they were handedly winning both matches and were even close to match point just before their teammates finished.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to win five of their six singles matches against the Highlanders including Johnsson’s impressive win on court four. The sophomore stole the first set away from his opponent, sweeping him 6-0. He nearly repeated this performance as he went up 5-0 in the second set, but then was forced to fight for a 6-2 win. He was the first Gaucho to finish and put his team up 2-0.</p>\n<p>Eshmade and Mays followed Johnsson’s example on courts one and two and took straight set victories as well with scores of 6-4, 6-3, and 6-3, 6-1, respectively. Riminton held down court six, playing singles for the first time since February and winning 6-2, 6-2. Freshman Cody Rakela bounced back from his loss on Saturday and took a three set win 6-0, 1-6, 6-4 to give the team its 6-1 overall win.</p>\n<p>The team will now head on the road to face UC Davis, University of the Pacific and Fresno State in three consecutive matches starting this Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62037\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/mens-tennis-remains-undefeated-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62037\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/mens-tennis-remains-undefeated-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/mens-tennis-remains-undefeated-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/mens-tennis-remains-undefeated-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/mens-tennis-remains-undefeated-at-home/","id":130,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[129,128,127],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Down Hawaii in Conference Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB began a stretch of four consecutive Big West matches by easily defeating Hawaii","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61937\" style=\"width: 317px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_09-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"960956785\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61934\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61937\" data-attachment-id=\"61937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/andrew-riminton-saves-a-ball-at-the-net-sam-aragondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_09-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Andrew Riminton saves a ball at the net.

Eshmade and sophomore Erik Johnsson were the first to finish as they defeated their opponents 6-1 on the number one court. Sophomore Morgan Mays and junior Andrew Riminton were the next to finish and took a one-sided victory as well at 6-2. This gave the Gauchos a 1-0 advantage heading into singles play.</p>\n<p>In singles play, freshman Cody Rakela continued his undefeated home streak taking the win in straight sets of 6-1, 6-1.

He, too, earned a victory in straight sets by scores of 6-3 and 6-4, which put UCSB up 3-0 and just one match away from sealing the victory.</p>\n<p>“The top of our lineup has been playing so much better recently, and this team is extremely deep this year,” Hamilton said. “Nathan has been playing amazing, Cody hasn’t lost a match and Morgan has been playing really well, too. All of our spots are really solid.”</p>\n<p>The players Hamilton spoke highly of did not disappoint, as they all were able to grab victories. Hawaii was only able to take one match away from the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Eshmade sealed the victory on court two to give the Gauchos a 4-1 victory with more tennis to be played. He defeated his opponent in straight sets of 6-3, 6-3 to continue his successful season.</p>\n<p>Mays and Johnsson took straight set victories as well to finish off the match and give the Gauchos a 6-1 victory. Since coming up to a starting position in early March, Johnsson has won every singles match and has helped the team to many doubles wins.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will prepare for the weekend ahead of them with matches on Saturday and Sunday. They will host both New Mexico State Saturday and conference opponent UC Riverside Sunday to conclude this home stand.</p>\n<p>“I am very confident about this weekend,” Hamilton said. “It won’t be a walk in the park, but it’s a good opportunity to extend our home streak and conference record.”</p>\n<p>The New Mexico match begins at 1 p.m. and the UC Riverside match starts at 10 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 15 of April 2, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61934\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61934\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/","id":145,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[144,143,142],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Seeks First Conference Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03.05.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03.05.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos take on Hawaii today as they seek to improve on their No. 60 national ranking.

The team was even able to grab two victories on the road, which it hadn’t done all season. This recent success of the Gauchos was enough to push them up to No. 60 in National ITA rankings.</p>\n<p>Today the team will be looking for its first conference win of the season as they played one early match at the beginning of February on the road in Irvine. Despite leading for a fraction of the match, Santa Barbara could not hold off UCI and fell 3-4 to the Anteaters. Including today’s match with the Rainbow Warriors, UCSB will have four more conference matches to push for the title. The Gauchos will have a helpful advantage in playing three of those matches at home, where they are an undefeated 5-0.</p>\n<p>“It’s the familiarity and being comfortable, as well as having your fans coming to support you that makes playing at home so special,” Mays said. “I really feed off of the energy of the crowd, and I think we all do in our own way, so it’s great to have them out there.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos found much of their recent success thanks to their top player from last season, senior Ziad Sultan, returning to singles play for the first time this season in their last road trip. Sultan eased his way into the lineup playing in just doubles matches at first and then finally retaking his spot in the number one court. With Sultan back at the one spot, the Gauchos are given talented depth with senior Tobias Galskov, junior Nathan Eshmade and Mays taking the next three spots for the team. All four players have played phenomenally throughout the season and have moved around throughout the four spots every week.</p>\n<p>Along with Sultan, sophomore Erik Johnsson has grabbed himself a spot in the starting lineup and has not made Head Coach Marty Davis regret that decision, as he is still undefeated in singles play. Johnsson has moved between both the fifth and sixth spots and has always found a way to achieve success after just breaking into this lineup at the beginning of March.</p>\n<p>“Ziad is the leader of this team, so it is inspiring to see him back in the lineup and Erik has not lost a singles match yet,” Mays said. “So we are all really excited to finish the season because we have some great opportunities ahead to finish strong.”</p>\n<p>Today’s match is set for 2 p.m. at the Rec Cen Courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/","id":148,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[147,146,145],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Enjoy First Road Wins of the Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB hasn't fared particularly well away from home this season, but it found a way to come out on top this past weekend","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61812\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03.05.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis5-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"487049692\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61825\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61812\" data-attachment-id=\"61812\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/gauchos-enjoy-first-road-wins-of-the-year/03-05-15christinademarzomenstennis5-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03.05.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis5-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.8\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Tobias Galskov runs to hit the ball to his opponent.

Despite the record, UCSB looked as if it was playing at home when it visited Northern Colorado and swept the match 7–0. This win put the team at an even record of 6–6 for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos won the doubles point with ease behind senior Ziad Sultan, who then made his first appearance this season in singles play. He reclaimed his number one spot in the courts, which he played in most of last season. Sultan picked up right where he left off, taking the match in three sets 6–4, 4–6, 6–3.</p>\n<p>Freshman Cody Rakela fought hard in a close match to cap off the sweep for his team. Other than Sultan, Rakela was the only player to go three sets in his singles matchup and just edged out his opponent 7–6, 4–6, 7–6.</p>\n<p>The very next day, the Gauchos traveled to take on the University of Denver Pioneers, who ended the Gauchos’ three-match win streak. Santa Barbara was only able to pick up two victories in singles play after dropping the doubles point and fell 5–2.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Morgan Mays was a bright spot for the Gauchos in their tough match with the Pioneers. He battled his opponent into three sets on the fourth-ranked court after being beaten in the first set 6–7. He took the remaining two, dominating 6–3, 6–4.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Erik Johnsson played on the sixth-ranked court and had a quicker matchup taking out his opponent in just two sets. He outscored his opponent 6–4, 7–6 in just his third singles matches of the season as he has just recently been bumped to a starting role.</p>\n<p>“Erik has been playing really well at practice,” Davis explained. “We decided to give him the shot since that spot has been shaky this year and he is playing really well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos capped off their road trip and their non-conference play with a match against the Boise State Broncos. Santa Barbara looked to nearly be out of it at the start before bouncing back to win 5–2.</p>\n<p>UCSB again struggled with the doubles point, throwing it behind 1–0, and Sultan was defeated in a very quick match on the number one court to extend the Bronco lead to 2–0.</p>\n<p>Johnsson, who was moved up to court number five after his recent success, took the first victory for the Gauchos to help keep the team alive. He once again took a straight victory, but a close one at 7–6, 6–4. Sophomore Teague Hamilton followed just after Johnsson and tied the match at two all with his sweep of 6–3, 6–4.</p>\n<p>The remaining three players, Mays, Rakela and junior Nathan Eshmade, went on to win their matchups and give the Gauchos a one-sided win of 5–2.</p>\n<p>“We’ve really just been playing great tennis lately,” Davis said. “I just hope we can keep this momentum going into conference.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will open up conference play with a 0–1 record having fallen to UC Irvine earlier in the season, but are an undefeated 5–0 at home, where they will face Hawaii. The match is set to start Wednesday at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/gauchos-enjoy-first-road-wins-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/gauchos-enjoy-first-road-wins-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/gauchos-enjoy-first-road-wins-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/gauchos-enjoy-first-road-wins-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/gauchos-enjoy-first-road-wins-of-the-year/","id":140,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[139,138,137],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Maintains Perfect Home Record","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos looked excellent at home this past weekend with a pair of exciting victories","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61750\" style=\"width: 326px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03.05.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"425986576\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61759\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61750\" data-attachment-id=\"61750\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/61759/03-05-15christinademarzomenstennis11-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03.05.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis11-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.8\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Nathan Eshmade hits the ball toward his Florida Gulf Coast opponent.

The Gauchos gave themselves a 1-0 lead by winning the doubles point to start off the match. The doubles duo of sophomore Erik Johnsson and junior Nathan Eshmade tied the doubles matches at 1-1. With the point on the line, the team of sophomore Morgan Mays and junior Andrew Riminton added a 6-4 victory to put the Gauchos up in the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB began to fall behind, dropping three of the first four completed singles matches as only freshman sensation Cody Rakela was able to capture a victory to protect his unbeaten record when playing at home. The Eagles were given a 3-2 advantage with just two matches left to play. UCSB’s match fell on the shoulders of Eshmade and senior Tobias Galskov with the team needing both players to win.</p>\n<p>“I knew we were down 2-3 and that the match was going to come down to me and Nate,” Galskov explained. “I knew they needed a win from me, so I stayed focused and just played it point by point.”</p>\n<p>Galskov finished off his senior opponent, No. 107 Jordi Vives, in straight sets 7-6, 6-2 to tie the overall match at 3-3 and leave the deciding point in the hands of Eshmade on court three.</p>\n<p>The junior battled in the first set and just edged out his opponent 7-6. With the match on the line, he captured the victory on a nonreturnable volley and dropped to the court where his teammates surrounded him in excitement. The Gauchos walked away with a tight win of 4-3.</p>\n<p>The match on Sunday with Gonzaga was a one sided affair for the Gauchos. Despite dropping the doubles point to start, the team was able to get the job done on the singles end, sweeping all six matches.</p>\n<p>“Playing in this atmosphere with all these fans and on the courts you practice on will always give you that extra advantage,” Rakela said. “Even when matches start to get close, you have your fans, teammates and coaches, and that comfort that allows you to edge out your opponents.”</p>\n<p>Rakela has shown just what playing at home does for him in his very first season as a Gaucho. Since his arrival in the fall, he has not lost a single match at home and kept that streak alive on Sunday with Gonzaga. His straight set victory of 6-4, 6-2 sealed the victory for UCSB, giving them a 4-1 advantage at that point. This freshman phenom has continued to push his team and has contributed scoring to all five victories at home.</p>\n<p>“I heard that there was three wins so I knew I was the clincher,” Rakela explained. “I really tried to hit a big serve and get pumped up on that match point. It was just great to get the W today and it was a quality win over a good team.”</p>\n<p>After being the last one to complete his match on Thursday, Eshmade was the first Gaucho done against Gonzaga. His performance against FGCU was enough to move him up to court two for the first time this season and made the most of the opportunity. He dominated in straight sets to win 6-1, 6-2.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have a couple weeks off and then they will look for their first road win on a long trip at the end of March. They will face three teams in four days to cap off non-conference play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/61759/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/61759/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/61759/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/61759/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/61759/","id":142,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[141,140,139],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Welcomes Florida Gulf Coast and Gonzaga to Town","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After having the last game cancelled, men's tennis is set to host FGCU and Gonzaga this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61597\" style=\"width: 267px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1840633719\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61590\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61597\" data-attachment-id=\"61597\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/mens-tennis-5/2-1-15christinademarzomenstennis11-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis11-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Morgan Mays hits the ball across the net toward his opponent.

Needless to say, this team is familiar with playing outside of its home stadium in Fort Meyers, Florida.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Expecting to add another victory to his long career as an Eagle is senior Tianyu Bao. In the team’s match with Cal Poly, Bao picked up his 100th career win in college tennis. The senior fought hard on the number five court and ended up taking the match in three sets 7-6, 4-6, 6-4.</p>\n<p>The Gonzaga Bulldogs are currently riding a four-match win streak after taking two straight victories on the road and then two more at home. During this stretch of wins, the Bulldogs have only lost a total of four sets and swept Creighton along the road. On the road, this team holds a record of 2-1 and its only loss came to a tough opponent in No. 41 Drake.</p>\n<p>Playing on the number one court for his Bulldogs team will be none other than senior Nick Kamisar. In his most recent match with Lewis-Clark State, the senior took a victory in sweeping style with scores of 6-0, 6-0. He will likely face off with UCSB’s senior Tobias Galskov or sophomore Morgan Mays.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have had a long break since their last match two weeks ago, but when playing at home they have been perfect. They hold a home record of 3-0 and have allowed their opponents just five sets in all three matches.</p>\n<p>These matches will be an opportunity to defend their unbeaten home record and add on a couple of wins before heading on a three-match road trip later this month to cap off non-conference play.</p>\n<p>“We have a couple of good-looking teams coming in this weekend,” Davis said. “But with the way that we’ve played at home this season, we have confidence.”<br>\nToday’s match is set to start at 1:30 p.m. and Sunday’s match at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Daniel is a beat writer for the UCSB men’s tennis team.

The Ducks have captured four wins by way of a 7-0 sweep and have only lost to ranked opponents this season. Their roster has depth that includes freshman sensation Simon Stevens, who is undefeated during dual matches this year and fills just the number four spot on the team.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB is not the favorite in the match, the team can capitalize on the fact that it is undefeated at home this season, and all of Oregon’s losses have occurred on the road. The Ducks are currently 0-4 as the away team after dropping a close match this weekend with No. 53 Pepperdine 4-3.</p>\n<p>This three-match home stand could not have come at better time for this Gaucho team that rides a two-match skid and has lost four of the last five. Much like the Ducks, the Gauchos are winless on the road at 0-6 and have played twice as many away matches, as home matches this season.</p>\n<p>“Without doubt, the men have benefited from the tremendous, large and loud crowds that have come out to the courts to this season,” Davis said. “Their presence definitely makes a difference.”</p>\n<p>In recent competition, the Gauchos have improved on an area of their game that struggled in the earlier part of the season. With the return of senior Ziad Sultan to the doubles lineup, the team has been a tougher competitor in the important doubles matches. Sultan and his senior partner Tobias Galskov have greatly contributed to the scoring of multiple doubles after the team started 0-3 this season in doubles play.</p>\n<p>Galskov as a singles player has powered much of the team’s success since his return a few weeks ago. The senior player has retaken his spot as the number one individual player on the team and faces the best opponent from each team that the Gauchos face.

Well-established stars and rookies alike have seen their seasons come to an end in a single instance and this has shown no bias to players, teams, or conferences.

The Warriors had a brief absence of Bogut, but that was nowhere near enough to throw them off course with their other weapons. And don’t believe for a minute that Steph is actually hurt right now.</p>\n<p>Atlanta plays a style of ball that would succeed without some of their pieces, but luckily for them, that hasn’t presented itself yet.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Grizzlies missed out on Z-Bo for a long stint early on, but since his return they have looked nearly perfect. Conley has also been in and out of the lineup a bit, but even in their absence, they stayed with the Warriors on top of the tough Western Conference. This resilience from these teams keeps them atop the power rankings once again as the only squads with 40+ wins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1) Golden State Warriors (43-10, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​One of the reasons for this team’s ability to avoid injury this year is smart moves from Kerr such as his recent choice to sit Steph with his soreness. The team is opening up a six game road trip and although they got their 10<sup>th</sup> loss they will surely have a better chance in the next five with a rested MVP candidate. Best record in the NBA despite the ATL season-high win streak. That speaks volumes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2) Memphis Grizzlies (41-14, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​They do say Defense wins championships. A Western Conference finals between these top two teams could be one for the ages and remind us all of the recent Seahawks v. Broncos Super Bowl. We all know how that turned out. The Grizzlies won both their games in this short week including last nights close battle with the Clippers. Holding Lob City to under 90 points is something to be proud of.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3) Atlanta Hawks (44-12, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​Rounding out the top three for the second straight week is this Hawks squad who has definitely cooled off from that streak that I mentioned earlier. Just 4-4 in the month of February due to some offensive troubles has people questioning the team’s depth and durability. This can’t be proven at the moment though, give them a chance to get out of the rut from the All-Star break.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4) Cleveland Cavaliers (35-22, +1)</strong></p>\n<p>​This team is seriously starting to look scary. Really any move that they could’ve made before the trade deadline would’ve benefited them, besides maybe sending away Lebron, but now they truly look like a deep and talented enough team to make a run in their first year together. The chemistry is building and it’s only going to go up from here. Toronto and Chicago, your spots are no longer safe. Good luck.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5) Houston Rockets (38-18, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Their one spot drop isn’t on their behalf by any means; the Cav’s pickups were just too strong. I hate to move them down too, with James Harden playing like he is right now. The man is literally willing this team to every win and making a solid MVP case for himself along the way. Don’t forget this team (just Harden) is doing this all without Dwight Howard as well. When he gets back, the defense may be in good enough form to win a round or two.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6) Los Angeles Clippers (37-20, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​Tough loss to the mighty defense of the Grizzlies without star Blake Griffin, but a couple W’s before that helped the pursuit to a higher seed. If they can outlast this hack-a-DJ phase or if DeAndre can just learn to shoot them, then they should be able to move up at least a spot or two.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7) Dallas Mavericks (38-20, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Amaré looked so good in his first minutes as a Maverick that I thought his jersey was orange and Nash was feeding him. This team has all the tools to compete and right now they could land anywhere between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 6<sup>th</sup> seeds and that’s not bad in the West but they will surely be playing some tough competition to start. They have a harsher schedule than most teams around their seeding ahead so home court advantage is going to take work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8) Toronto Raptors (37-19, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​This new starting lineup looks as good as the hype is treating it, but a loss to an AD-less Pelicans team is a tough one to swallow for The North. They’re one of few teams that has under 20 losses but when you look at their division, which they have a 13 game advantage over, it isn’t hard to tell why.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9) San Antonio Spurs (34-22, -2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Let’s just say that the last time I wrote this blog, this team had 34 wins… Taking losses from teams like the Jazz just isn’t going to cut and for once in this millennium, this mighty franchise may be showing some wear and tear. Kawhi isn’t providing the spark and the big 3 is settling down. 5-5 in their last ten games took a toll on them as they hang on to the seventh seed currently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10) Chicago Bulls (36-21, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​The defense just hasn’t been there this year and how could you expect it when you add an offensive player like Gasol and Butler comes out of his shell? The team gets to play quite a few games in a row at home this week which would be nice except that they have a better road record. Derrick Rose needs to wake up from hibernation that started with his first injury and lead this team again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>11) Portland Trailblazers (36-19, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​With a struggling Nick Batum, the Blazers made a breakthrough pickup in trading for an offensive Aaron Afflalo. This without a doubt makes them a scarier team than they already were but if LA can’t stay in the game, we’ll know for sure that the team should’ve shut him down at the first sight of that injury.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>12) Oklahoma City Thunder (31-25, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Holding on to the eighth seed will not be as difficult of a task with a nearly brand new team that emerged post trade-deadline. Depth was an issue with this team and now the frontcourt has more potential than ever. Russell Westbrook has forgotten KD’s absence and is making a case for himself as the League’s most valuable player. When’s the last time two separate guys on the same team won back-to-backs?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>13) Milwaukee Bucks (31-25, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Bringing the defending ROY to your squad can never really hurt but we will have to see if the young guard spoils the chemistry or not, Knight was a perfect piece to this team but building for the future is never a bad thing to do, ask any team that is dominant now. Jabari Parker was a favorite for ROY this year before injury, they could have had back to backs. When’s the last time that happened either?</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><strong>14) Washington Wizards (33-23, -2)</strong></p>\n<p>​A team riding a three game skid and has only won two games in the last ten. For those of you mathematicians out there, that means they have picked up over 33 percent of their losses just in those last 10 games alone. Playing without Beal has shown their soft spot and just like the Spurs, they have the same amount of wins as they did in last week’s rankings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>15) Phoenix Suns (29-28, -2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Yet another team to go winless in the past week. Can’t exactly blame them when trying to implement an entire new lineup after so many moves on deadline day. A team that was once overloaded with guards may have found a good mix in the Knight-Bledsoe duo. If they can get cooking, then the Thunder may have to actually start worrying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>16) Detroit Pistons (23-33, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​The acquisition of Reggie Jackson undoubtedly adds a necessary depth to this team’s backcourt and with the playoff race as tight as it is, this team now has a legitimate chance. They have the talent and the coaching, they just need to put the two together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>17) New Orleans Pelicans (29-27, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​The third team in the battle for the West’s eight seed does not look like a heavy contender if AD can’t get his body right. He tried to deliver what looked like a hit stick and ironically destroyed himself in the process, which is never a good sign. He and Ryan Anderson will be out for quite a bit so Tyreke will get the green light.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>18) Indiana Pacers (23-33, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Still on the rise winning seven of their last ten and their last three straight. A mixture of Stuckey and Hill has been a recipe for an unstoppable offense as they have sparked Indiana to a playoff team once again. By playoff team, I of course just mean that they have a seed. I wouldn’t exactly call them a playoff team just because of that. They have too much left to prove after this season’s start. PG return, come soon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>19) Boston Celtics (21-33, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​The acquisition of Isaiah Thomas was a big step forward and on the same day they took a big step back losing their best player Sully once again. Along with that IT is showing his old Kings style of play getting thrown out of his first Celtics-Lakers rivalry game. The combo of Smart and Thomas could be enough to snag an eighth seed but they have some catching up to do and without Sullinger it won’t be easy. Impressive win over Suns last night, but a loss to the Lakers? Really?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>20) Charlotte Hornets (22-32, -3)</strong></p>\n<p>​They and the Suns are tied for the biggest skid at the moment standing at five straight losses. Before hopping on this losing streak they held control of the seventh spot in the East and now have fallen to 11<sup>th</sup> behind Detroit and a hot Indiana. Mo Williams was supposed to be able to fill-in in Walker’s absence but this team can’t wait much longer for his return.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>21) Brooklyn Nets (23-31, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​Maybe got a little confidence in their thrashing of the Nuggets last night but we will see how far that will carry them. They made a great move in swapping KG for Thad Young, which gives them a little more depth for the future. This team has been playing .500 basketball as of late but in the eighth spot, that may not cut it. Time for their many vets to get going.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>22) Utah Jazz (21-34, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​An impressive running through over the defending champions last night that followed an even more impressive win over the Blazers. The dealing of Enes Kanter allowed for Gobert to take more minutes and the defense looks better than ever since the trade. Defense is really what they lacked in so this is the most positive sign they’ve seen all year. The west may be too brutal for any luck this year though.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>23) Miami Heat (24-31, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​The acquisition of the Dragic boys was the talk of the trade deadline but that happened just following it with Chris Bosh without a doubt has a bigger impact. I wish Bosh a speedy and efficient recovery but in the meantime Dragic and Hassan better figure out a way to keep a playoff seed. This point guard may be the best that D-Wade has ever had, but his success seems to be independent of that in his career.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>24) Sacramento Kings (19-35, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>Only snagging three out their last ten games isn’t going to impress future Hall of Famer George Karl. Since arriving Karl has flipped the pace of the offense, which has now happened to this team a total of three times on the season. Give them a chance to get into the flow of things and maybe next year they’ll have another hot start; maybe one that they can stay on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>25) Orlando Magic (19-39, +3)</strong></p>\n<p>​A three game win streak says a lot about new interim head coach James Borrego and a 4-2 overall record is nothing to scoff at with the team he has adopted. Let’s just try not to focus on the fact that they beat the Sixers, Lakers, and Knicks and give him a round of applause.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>26) Minnesota Timberwolves (12-43, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Really? Kevin Garnett? Please don’t even try to lie and convince me that this was purely a basketball move, sending away a young kid with potential for the greatest player in that franchise’s history, who is older than some coaches and plays like it. I understand drawing fans and making money, but at least try to hide it better. I thought this was a building season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>27) Denver Nuggets (20-36, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​The most positive part about their trade deadline play was getting rid of some heavy contracts that frees up space for other players. The only question more interesting than what will happen to this team, is what will happen to our Gaucho Brian Shaw?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>28) Philadelphia 76ers (12-44, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Here I am thinking that MCW was the guard that they waited so long to get, but I guess I thought the same about Nerlens and Embiid  as well. MCW played one year, balled out, and got shipped out for some pieces that put this team in an interesting place. With McDaniels leaving as well, they fall back into the category where dumb fans will ask if they can even beat Kentucky.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>29) Los Angeles Lakers (14-41, +1)</strong></p>\n<p>​An overtime victory over the rival Celtics is enough to pull you out of last place in my eyes, without bias. But the team better watch out and not grab too many victories or they may be losing their top, and really only draft pick this year. Oh and by the way, they are pretty close to a franchise worst record. It’d be for the best to get it though.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>30) New York Knicks (10-45, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Hey nobody is in single digits, that’s something to celebrate. That’s about all one can celebrate with Melo being shut down for the rest of the season.
