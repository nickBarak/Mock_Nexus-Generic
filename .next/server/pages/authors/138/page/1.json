Mitine said organizing the event was fun because she loves Christmas and the winter season.</p>\n<p>“Decorating was fun,” Mitine said. “The holiday times are my favorite, so doing a program like this was not a problem.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Yaneli Gutierrez said her favorite part of the party was decorating cookies, which she modeled after her reindeer sweater. Gutierrez also said she attended the party because she enjoys Christmas and ugly sweaters.</p>\n<p>“The tackier the better,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Aranki said she wanted to host a fun holiday party as a “de-stresser” for her residents.</p>\n<p>“I really care about residents a lot, especially their mental well-being,” Aranki said.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she hoped the event would be a fun way to bring the residents together.</p>\n<p>“Everyone always talks about how they miss being home for the holidays,” Mitine said. “Dead Week and finals are so stressful.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said the Loma Pelona Center was chosen for the event because it is between Manzanita and San Rafael residence halls and facilitates opportunities to meet other students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just a nice way to get people out of their room or away from the library for a little bit and to all be out here together,” Mitine said.</p>\n<p>Third year biology major Heidi Lee said Christmas is one of her favorite holidays because she gets to spend time with friends and family.</p>\n<p>“I want to skip over finals and get to break,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>International student from Belgium Annelies Leenknecht said she is currently taking classes at Santa Barbara City College on a gap year.</p>\n<p>Leenknecht said she enjoyed attending the party in preparation for winter break, although she wishes she was returning to Santa Barbara in January.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could come back here afterwards,” Leenknecht said. “I have to stay home unfortunately.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/","id":2600,"author":{"id":138,"name":"Selina Alvarez"},"related":[2599,2598,2597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Increased Usage of LSD-like Synthetic Drugs Identified in I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/LSD_by-Maddy-Jurisich-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/LSD_by-Maddy-Jurisich-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Student Health Director Mary Ferris sent a university email Thursday to warn students of a recent increase in the use of synthetic, LSD-like drugs.

Synthetic drugs mimic the effects of illegal substances and have slightly altered chemical structures, which tend to be more powerful and unpredictable than non-synthetic substances. They can cause excited delirium, anxiety and paranoia which can lead to violent aggression and self-injury. The risks of using these drugs include seizures, heart attacks and death.</p>\n<p>Alcohol and Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta said users of synthetic drugs are looking for effects similar to LSD but have much more severe experiences.</p>\n<p>“The kind of trips students are expecting to take when they take LSD is not the kind of response they are getting from the substances,” Kurta said.</p>\n<p>Kurta said N-Bomb, Flakka and bath salts are the most common synthetic drugs students have reportedly been attaining.</p>\n<p>“These substances are not pure LSD, but they are chemically combined substances which result in unpredictable self-harm, unexpected psychotic unexplainable behavior,” Kurta said. “We know that it’s out there and that it’s very available.”</p>\n<p>According to Department of Psychological and Brain Studies professor Karen Szumlinski, bath salts are synthetic derivatives of cathinone, an active stimulant prohibited in some states and banned in some countries. Szumlinski said it blocks re-uptake of dopamine and serotonin, causing pleasurable effects, and blocks norepinephrine receptors, increasing the user’s heart rate.</p>\n<p>“Bath salts are a generic name for a composite of all sorts of different chemicals,” Szumlinski said. “With bath salts, because they’re more amphetamine-like, you will have more delusions of issues that are related to your illegal drug activity.”</p>\n<p>Szumlinski said the cathinone derivatives are also found in spice, Flakka and K-2 synthetic marijuana that can cause psychosis. According to Szumlinski, Flakka has the effects of hallucinogens and amphetamines and can cause aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>“Flakka blows my mind and is frightening,” Szumlinski said. “Flakka is LSD-like and actually activates the same receptors that LSD activates, the serotonin 2A receptors.”</p>\n<p>Szumlinski said N-Bomb is similar to LSD in that it also activates the serotonin 2A receptor that LSD activates, and it is not a safer alternative.</p>\n<p>“The effects are shorter than LSD,” Szumlinski said. “In terms of it being safer than LSD, the answer is not at all.”</p>\n<p>An anonymous first-year biochemistry major who is a repeat user of LSD and a one-time user of N-Bomb said while both drugs are euphoric, a LSD trip can be described as more of a “central experience” while N-Bomb is more of a “chaotic” party drug.</p>\n<p>“With N-Bomb you have more visual effects, and LSD has more mental and psychological effects,” the student said.</p>\n<p>The student said they chose to consume the synthetic drug out of curiosity, but did not have a positive experience.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t have a good time with it, and I’d rather just stick with actual LSD,” the student said.</p>\n<p>The students also said for many users of N-Bomb, “you don’t know what you’re getting into.”</p>\n<p>“If you don’t know it’s N-Bomb, you can get a bad trip,” the student said. “It’s kind of like weed in a way, you laugh a lot, at random shit, and the visuals are much more than LSD.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) Sergeant Daniel Calderon said synthetic drug use is “everywhere.”</p>\n<p>“It’s throughout California, it’s throughout the states, it’s a worldwide problem. There has been an increase in synthetic-type drug use, but that’s globally across the board, it’s not just in Isla Vista,” Calderon said. “I believe that people sometimes think it’s safer because they are synthetic and/or man-made.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP receives medical calls for synthetic drug users displaying erratic behavior or psychological episodes. According to Calderon, these subjects often “can’t comprehend logical thought” and do not want care from emergency response.</p>\n<p>“They’re in such a delusional state that they’ll actually try to fight against the medics,” Calderon said. “Any type of drug can be dangerous because you don’t know how your body is going to react.”</p>\n<p>IVFP Deputy Simon Trujillo said the use and possession of these drugs is not prohibited, but the sale to minors is illegal in some areas.</p>\n<p>“The main problem with them is there are many combinations, there’s many different chemical compositions … there is no uniform way to control how they are produced. Their effects are often unpredictable,” Trujillo said. “If a user were to use them multiple times they may get a different reaction or a different experience each time they use them.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said part of the appeal of synthetic drugs is that they are an alternative to traditional street drugs, and that they can be marketed and distributed in packaging similar to candy wrappers.</p>\n<p>Calderon said in medical emergencies involving drugs, it is best to seek help and notify the authorities of information that can aid responders in helping intoxicated persons.</p>\n<p>“They’re not going to get in trouble and it’s better to call,” Calderon said. “They’re protected by law against any prosecution in a medical emergency.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66539\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66539\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/","id":2607,"author":{"id":138,"name":"Selina Alvarez"},"related":[2606,2605,2604],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CeCe McDonald Answers Student Questions for Trans Revolution Series","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Resource Center for Sexual & Gender Diversity hosted a discussion with LGBTQ activist CeCe McDonald on Thursday, Oct. 22 in The Hub as part of its Trans Revolution Series.

McDonald stabbed and killed the man in self-defense, but was sent to a male prison for 19 months, leading to the “Free CeCe” movement.

McDonald said her attackers were “Neo-Nazi drunk assholes” who yelled slurs at her and accused her of trying to mislead men about her gender.</p>\n<p>“We have the right to be ‘mad black women’ if we choose to be because look at the trauma, look at the oppression, look at the violence that we face on a day to day basis,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said the prosecution argued her attackers’ previous violent history, swastika tattoo and toxicology report did not pertain to the case.</p>\n<p>“[The attacker was] known for beating his partner, who was one of the people there that night who attacked me,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said she did a lot of “meditating and self-reflection” in and out of prison and listens to Beyoncé because it gives her “solitude.” McDonald said she also finds peace in being able to share her story and promote justice for transgender people.</p>\n<p>“Having a voice keeps me grounded,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said reading the books sent to her by supporters while she was in prison, like <em>The New Jim Crow,</em> changed her experience dramatically and made her “question so much.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65719\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1137920179\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66067\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65719\" data-attachment-id=\"65719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/cece-mcdonald-answers-student-questions-for-trans-revolution-series/mcdonald_riley-esguerra-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1332&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1332\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Riley Esguerra\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445503321\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"100\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McDonald_Riley Esguerra-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“The things that we were taught, we internalize and think it’s true,” McDonald said. “When will we be able to give our youth <em>The New Jim Crow</em>?”</p>\n<p>First-year music major Jordan Mitchell said he asked McDonald during a question and answer portion of the talk what intersectional oppression she faced within the black community for being a transgender woman.</p>\n<p>“CeCe McDonald critiques with brutal honesty the intersectionality of trans people of color, the prison industrial complex, religious indoctrination in America,” Mitchell said. “She brings her experiences as a light to influence the minds of young individuals at UCSB.

three-floor residence for visiting scholar physicists located adjacent to the San Clemente Villages, scheduled to open late next year.</p>\n<p>American businessman and philanthropist Charlie Munger donated $65 million to be used for constructing the Visiting Scholars Residence, a 75,000-square-foot building located on El Colegio Road west of San Clemente apartments. The Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP includes meeting rooms, shared kitchens, dining rooms, a gym and 61 apartment style, fully-furnished private bedrooms with private bathrooms. The residence will also house a flag hall to display national flags of current visiting scholars. Construction began October 2014 and the Visiting Scholars Residence is planned to open late 2016. KITP is a research facility created in 1979 which hosts programs such as Deconstructing the Sense of Smell and Dynamics and Evolution of Earth-like Planets.</p>\n<p>KITP residence manager James Brill said he currently collaborates with visiting scholars to coordinate housing in Isla Vista and Santa Barbara. According to Brill, he contributed to the layout design of the Visiting Scholars Residence and attributes the success of the construction to Munger’s donation.</p>\n<p>“We had a very informal rental program … so as a result, years ago, they really thought about making some sort of residence,” Brill said. “Then, as we kept adding more and more scientists, it became a definite need, and then just last year Charlie Munger decided to give us a very, very generous grant to build the residence.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the residence will accommodate visiting scholars at UCSB as well as their families.</p>\n<p>“We’ve designed a lot of the rooms to be family friendly — we have like a child’s play room and we want to make sure nothing is stopping you from coming and being as productive as you can possibly be while you’re here,” Brill said.</p>\n<p>According to Brill, the meeting rooms allow visiting physicists to interact off-campus and to conduct their work in their living setting.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got everyone working on a program, you’re all together, which is something the physicists really wanted,” Brill said. “It’s really nice that you can do a lot of intensive work no matter where you are.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the exterior of the Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP is meant to resemble Santa Barbara architecture.</p>\n<p>“Because we have such a big international group, we tried to tie it into the construction that we have in Santa Barbara … we want it to fit into the aesthetic of the neighborhood,” Brill said. “The main goal of KITP is to get people from all parts of the world to get together.”</p>\n<p>Director of KITP and professor of astrophysics and cosmology Lars Bildsten said KITP hosts programs year round to “capture frontier topics” and provide a venue for open discussions.</p>\n<p>“The major thing that the KITP provides for the university is a huge flock of physicists that come for long periods and interact mostly with each other, but most of our activities are open to the campus,” Bildsten said. “So we get a lot of physics graduates students, mathematical graduate students, biology students who come and interact with the visitors.”</p>\n<p>UCSB professor of biophysics and KITP permanent member Boris Shraiman said KITP is a “fantastic” place physicists can visit to be inspired.</p>\n<p>“[The] new residence will allow our physicists to stay together and keep working and thinking about science 24/7,” Shraiman said. “It will become immediately an attraction and I expect to go there in the evening to hang out with the scientists.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
