At 75 years old, Joan Baez appears as effortlessly cool as she did when she rose to fame in the 1960s as the next great American troubadour. Now, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award holder and Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Nominee, Baez continues her contemporary folk rock legacy, most recently performing at downtown Santa Barbara’s Arlington Theatre. There’s no question that Baez’s command of the stage is nothing short of powerful, for after a quick greeting, she strums her guitar, allowing the entire room to melt into its seats, a collective release of tension.<br>\nBaez led with a rendition of the song “Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word” by the musician she helped bring to fame, Bob Dylan. She joked that she would sing a few Dylan songs in light of it being “Bob Dylan appreciation month,” referencing his recent Nobel Prize in Literature. Vocally, Baez fluctuates between her signature soprano trill and a mature, light, husky tone. The familiar tune prompted many audience members who had come with their significant others to cuddle up to her sweet and sentimental serenade.<br>\nJoining her onstage was her band, who appropriately entered wearing “Bad Hombre” T-shirts to accompany Baez’s own wardrobe, which was the first of many 2016 election references of the night. The team consists of Dirk Powell, who played a variety of stringed instruments throughout the show, and Baez’s only son, Gabriel Harris, who provided percussion. “Turns out she can sing,” Baez said of her personal assistant, Grace Stumberg, whom she also invited on stage to accompany her through backing vocals and little duets. The talented bunch even did so well as to steal the spotlight from Baez at times, especially in the case of Stumberg, whose impressive belt brought a modern complexity to the music.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74110\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1436783336\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74109\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74110\" data-attachment-id=\"74110\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/3523-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"306,306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"3523-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-74110\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Arts and lectures\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?w=306&amp;ssl=1 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Arts and Lectures</p></div>\n<p>Kathryn Krebs, a Santa Barbara local, reminisces “[going] to the county Bowl when the lawn seats were $5. I saw her when she played for Cesar Chavez and the farmworkers.” Another audience member, Martha Donovan, expressed her love for the song “Deportee,” claiming, “It’s so appropriate now.” Baez, who is of Mexican descent, obviously agreed, as she placed heavy importance on the song before performing it. Her version is touching, tender and a perfect example of how her music immediately impacts the audience, as it left Donovan dabbing tears from her eyes. Powell, Baez’s accompanist, targeted the crowd, mentioning that if the song strongly resonated with anyone, he urges them to vote in the upcoming election. In particular, he promoted his stepmother, Joan Hartmann, who was recently elected Third District County Santa Barbara supervisor.<br>\nBaez, whose setlist flows through personal anecdotes of her journey to musical recognition or her social activism, continued with songs such as “Prison Trilogy,” which she penned when her then-boyfriend, David Harris, who was arrested for resisting draft in 1969. Today, the song continues to hold significance to Baez as she revealed her tour is in conjunction with the Innocence Project, a program that, according to its website, “exonerates the wrongly convicted through DNA testing and reforms the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.” Baez even recounted the inspiration she drew from visiting a man who had recently been acquitted after 28 years in prison and his outlook on life. “He’s not bitter,” she said before claiming that it’s cases like those that call us to, as the song says, “raze the prisons to the ground.”<br>\nShe went on to perform many favorites such as “She Could Never Resist A Winding Road,” “Me and Bobby McGee” and “Do Right Woman, Do Right Man.” Her most stunning part of the set, however, was the haunting “Diamonds and Rust,” an entirely dark acoustic performance, set in front of an ethereal and foggy background that left me with chills down my spine. Baez, who seems to find the humor in all of her music, tweaked the end of the song by adding, with a devious twinkle in her eye, “if you’re offering me diamonds and rust … Well, I’ll take the diamonds,” before nonchalantly taking a sip of tea, as the audience roared with cheers and laughter.<br>\nAs the concert progressed, it became obvious that for many, Baez’s music brings forth a collection of memories of youth and rebellion. The messages of the music, while more common nowadays, were themes that began a revolution for many of the adults that sat in the theater that night. “I grew up with Joan Baez. She represents all of the angst of growing up,” Krebs affirmed. Donovan added, “I first saw her in eighth grade. I snuck into this little club in Los Angeles, and I remember thinking, ‘We need more people like that in our world.’” Others discovered identity and individuality through the music. Debra Stanfield, who saw Baez live for the first time that night, talked about how Baez helped “develop what [she] believed about society.” Adding to her sentiments, Stanfield concludes that Baez influenced her as a person, because her songs “related to the needs that people had. I’m a psychotherapist, so I guess I found some personal meaning from her.”<br>\nTo round off the night, Baez answered the demand for an encore with a rendition of the traditional gospel standard “Swing Low Sweet Chariot.” The stage was a modern echo of her famous performance of the song at the legendary 1969 Woodstock festival. Likewise, the Arlington Theatre was transported to a dimension of nothing but “peace and music.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

other movie goers on Friday evening as they eagerly awaited the commencement of the screening of “Swiss Army Man.” For only $4, the event, hosted by UCSB’s Magic Lantern Films, boasted a night of tasty snacks, interesting trivia, themed prizes and, most importantly, an appearance by Daniel Scheinert, one of the directors of the film. The event delivered, with an arsenal of buttery complimentary popcorn at the entrance, a plethora of film posters and a swiss army knife, ready to be given away to lucky prize winners. Upon stepping into the screening area, the first sight was that of the night’s special guest, who looked nearly indistinguishable from the college students who surrounded him, chatting to a large group of curious and attentive viewers.</p>\n<p>“Swiss Army Man,” which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in January, follows the story of Hank, played by Paul Dano (“Little Miss Sunshine” and “Love and Mercy”), who is stranded on a desert island. He discovers a corpse named Manny, played by Daniel Radcliffe (of Harry Potter fame), whose body has special powers. Hank manipulates Manny’s powers, which consist of a number of odd bodily functions, to navigate their way back home. Throughout their hilarious and heartfelt journey, Hank teaches Manny what it is like to be alive and Manny reminds Hank of what it is like to not be alone.</p>\n<p>The movie thrived off of its disarming and offbeat humor, in a series of uncomfortably funny moments in which Manny attempts to understand and adapt to the conventions of the world. Yet, it displays a vulnerable, raw human connection between Dano’s lonely and undeniably relatable Hank and Radcliffe’s compassionate corpse.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The film was written and directed by Scheinert and his creative partner Daniel Kwan, who, together, call themselves The Daniels. This is Scheinert and Kwan’s first feature film. However, the two previously garnered internet fame through their innovative music videos for artists such as Foster The People and The Shins. One of their more terrifically absurd videos, created for Lil Jon’s song “Turn Down for What,” was even played before the screening of the film. Second-year Erin Sim remarked, “It was so interesting to see how their style translated from the music videos to the big screen. It was obvious some of their previous work influenced the movie, especially in terms of the special effects.”</p>\n<p>Following the screening, Scheinert climbed onstage as T. Rex’s “I Love to Boogie” blasted through the speakers of the auditorium. He explained that he “drove down from L.A. with a bunch of [his] friends with that song on repeat throughout the whole trip,” and expressed his newfound distaste for it. During a Q&amp;A session, he mentioned that the film contained many musical inside jokes much like that one, including a ballad rendition of “Cotton Eye Joe” performed by the directors’ friends, Manchester Orchestra, and the frequently hummed tune of Jurassic Park. “I always hum that or ‘Kiss from a Rose,’ by Seal, [while working with Kwan],” Scheinert joked.</p>\n<p>The audience was graced with tidbits of trivia, including how the appearance of a fictional creature in the film came to be. “Daniel Radcliffe’s bodyguard dressed up as Bigfoot one day and just ran in the back of shots,” Scheinert revealed. And when asked where the multitude of fart sounds littered throughout the movie were obtained, he chuckled, replying, “I guess it’s kind of illegal, but we actually took tracks from this video online called ‘101 Real Farts’ … We wanted the farts to be unique, because every one was supposed to be a character development moment.” As the audience roared with laughter, he expressed his hopes that “someone will recognize their own fart in [the] movie.”</p>\n<p>One audience member commended Scheinert on the impact of the film, explaining that they had gotten up to go to the bathroom during the middle of the movie, but upon seeing “everyone in pure awe, laughing and smiling” they rethought their decision. Scheinert alluded that the film’s creation process was similar: hard to abandon. He advised aspiring filmmakers to “make sure your movie is fun to make,” and to treat it like “a therapy project.”</p>\n<p>“This was one of the best audiences I think we’ve seen,” said Stephanie Lynch, Scheinert’s girlfriend. “It was a really great group of people. Everyone was so into it; it was really cute.”</p>\n<p>The turnout seemed to impress a fair few people. “This was one of the best [screening experiences] we’ve ever had,” said Magic Lantern producer DJ Palladino. “There were these guys from Ventura who made [‘Bellflower’], which The New Yorker called ‘the future of cinema’ and these guys came and they were amazing, and there were only twenty-five people in the audience. ”</p>\n<p>The evening ended in a way left up to individual interpretation, much like the film did, when Scheinert was asked what the point of “Swiss Army Man” was.
