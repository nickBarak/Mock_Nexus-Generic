A diverse crowd of teachers, students and adults packed the room, leaving very little space to encompass any further persons. A table and four microphones adorned the stage, patiently waiting for the presence of Black Panther members Emory Douglas and Akinsanya Kambon. Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Black Panthers, the revolutionaries spoke on how they employed art as a way to reflect the struggles and cultural history of African Americans and their rebellion to the oppression in their society. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd anxiously awaited Douglas to take the stage as Professor Diane Fujino began the event. Introducing an atmosphere of solidarity and cross cultural support, a group of indigenous Chumash Indians took to the stage to thank and honor the speakers for their attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emory Douglas took to the stage, his presence so intense that the room echoed silence, and his first words rang powerfully through the ears of his listeners, “All power to the people!”; this was recited back to him with a fervor that matched those protesting the streets of IV. He introduced his position within the party, the Minister of Culture, as he played a video of the Panthers detailing his role. Douglas had constructed iconic images, that embodied the Black Panther Party’s persona of the militant and revolutionary poor, one that resonated with and began to define the insurgent minority. A powerpoint of his art plastered the vast screen behind him, allowing the audience to fully experience his art. Douglas spoke of a widely unknown narrative, one seldom affiliated with the panthers: the community work the Panthers engaged in and the role his art played in further inciting change. He used his artwork “to enlighten, to educate and to inform” the community through the BPP’s newspaper– he worked “to create a culture of resistance” in his community. His art flashed across the screen behind him, branding the social commentary into the minds of his viewers. The stark images, in very little color, told stories of the social and political climate of the time, some very similar to that of our contemporary world. It was art based on necessity, what was the most impactful, made with the resources they had. As Douglas finished, the audience erupted into swarm of cheers and clapping as he left the stage.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Devin Clark thought the event was awesome. “I didn’t know what to expect, but it was so enlightening.” When asked what was taken from the conversations, Clark replied “they played their part and now it’s our time and our responsibility to do our part”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd calmed down, Akinsanya Kambon walked up the to the stage and proclaimed “art must be used to uplift and educate humanity”. Students and adults riled up once again, cheered as he began speaking. He spoke of the atrocities of his tour in Vietnam, exposing the discrepancies in society, juxtaposing those he saw in his day with those prevalent now. Kambon demanded respect as he stood tall, voice chiming through the room disregarding any politeness. His words, raw and unrestrained, were so powerful and inspiring, that his speech was continually interrupted by cheers from the audience. He spoke of the importance of culture and heritage and how that inspired his art. He spoke of how the BPP educated him, influencing the construction of his famous </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Panther Coloring Book. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next part of the event was a “conversation with the artists”, Douglas and Kambon talked with Professors Diane Fujino and Felice Blake. They covered questions of how the BPP utilized and taught literacy, the influences of their art and the international reach of the Black Panther Party, comparing these to the issues today. The audience hung onto each word, dripping with eagerness to ask their own questions to the revolutionaries. Finally the questions were opened to all and a sea of hands sprang up; many were anxious with inquiry. Topics concerning Colin Kaepernick, imperialism and Donald Trump’s presidency arose, along with more broad questions of how to create political and social change, how to dismantle the oppressive systems and the purpose of protest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The event was concluded as Emiliano Martinez, a representative of the American Indian Movement, played an honoring song to the Panther members, creating a lasting atmosphere of solidarity. UCSB student Kate Thorsland really enjoyed the event and was glad she came out. “It really resonated with me because of what is going on politically right now. Movements like this are deemed “radical” but are necessary. This event was definitely well timed for me as unfortunately the same issues are happening now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Multicultural Center then hosted a reception afterwards to honor the artwork created by both Douglas and Kambon. I was able to speak to Kambon and ask him what advice he would give to UCSB students looking to create change. “Organize and change the world,” he said, “don’t worry about politicians, they’re a part of the system that wants to keep the status quo. Change is up to you”.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74329\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74329\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/","id":6525,"author":{"id":737,"name":"Savanah Marshall"},"related":[6524,6523,6522],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Maceo Parker Brings Legendary Funk to Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Maceo-Parker-1-by-Ines-Kaiser.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Maceo-Parker-1-by-Ines-Kaiser.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB’s own Campbell Hall hosted a performance by the legendary funk and soul jazz saxophonist Maceo Parker as a part of Arts & Lectures’ Roots Series","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p class=\"Normal1\">The dim room stirred in anticipation as nearly every seat was filled with eager bodies. The stage was brightly lit in hues of blues, red and violet. On Thursday night, UCSB’s own Campbell Hall hosted a performance by the legendary funk and soul jazz saxophonist Maceo Parker as a part of Arts &amp; Lectures’ Roots series. Parker is most known for his work alongside James Brown in the 1960s and with Parliament-Funkadelic in the ’70s. After going solo in the ’90s, he began playing alongside legends like Prince and De La Soul.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">The crowd, composed of mainly older adults and a few college students, sat in the massive auditorium waiting for the first act to go on. The room was almost completely full and many were buzzing with excitement, creating a very high energy in the room.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Opening for Parker was The Jones Family Singers, a band made up of family members from Houston, Tex. Performing in the style of gospel blues and jazz, this was their Santa Barbara debut. They had amazing stage presence, directing the audience to stand up and dance along with them. Their large vocal range rang through the hall as their five vocalists filled the room with bluesy lyrics. The energy they brought to the stage was so powerful that many people stood up and jived along while clapping to the beat. One of the main vocalists then employed a call-response method, successfully engaging with the audience by transporting them back to the roots of gospel. The crowd was so high-energy and so responsive, one could feel more than just the music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The screams of the crowd were almost deafening, drowning out the sounds of the announcer. The music started and the crowd went almost silent. The heavy bass and strong funky drum pattern complemented the smooth sounds of Parker’s saxophone. Add in the brass trombone, a guitar and a piano, and the blending of sounds brought you back to the funkadelic grooves of the 1970s. Parker’s music epitomizes what funk is; the rhythmic tune of the bass emphasized the down beat alongside the jazzy and soulful blues. The compilation of intricate sounds blended together so effortlessly, varying between slow jazz and a faster upbeat, funky tempo. One could hardly sit still. Many were shaking their heads, tapping their feet and swaying to the intense rhythm. At one point, many had gotten up out of their chairs to dance to the music. The entire set was accompanied by shouts of love and encouragement as well as constant clapping and whistles. The legend played well-known songs by other famous artists like Ray Charles, Jamie Foxx, Marvin Gaye and Ben E. King. Parker continually sang in his deep, throaty voice “We love you,” engaging with the audience while also showing his appreciation. He made small jokes here and there, really talking to his audience, confirming his ability to connect with the crowd. The response back to Parker was electric and almost tangible. The audience grooved to the tunes as the sharp guitar riffs and the blunt plucking sound of the bass echoed through the hall. The energy, almost as palpable as the music itself, rang through the ears of every person experiencing Parker’s talent. The show ended with a very long, rad drum solo, and Parker played the crowd out. Screams and claps reverberated through the large hall.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">UCSB alumnus Patricia Oreño said that this was a wonderful time. “As a child of the ’70s, I grew up with funk, and I’ve always been a fan.
