The suspects were last seen fleeing on foot eastbound on Del Playa.</p>\n<p>Hoover said both victims were transported to a local hospital, and the stabbing victim sustained serious injuries. Neither of the victims’ names or current conditions had been released as of Sunday night.</p>\n<p>An emergency notification was sent out to the campus community shortly after officers arrived on the scene. Anyone with information about the incident is encouraged to contact the UCSB Police Department at (805) 893-3446 or leave an anonymous tip on the Sherriff’s Office’s website.</p>\n<p><span

is one of the weirdest places in America.  The number-2-ranked university in parties (Princeton Review) and research citations worldwide  (Leiden University) is situated next to the most densely populated square-half-mile community in California that drinks more per capita than many states (educated speculation).  After living here for a while, the behavior of 18-to-24 year-olds will become so normalized that you might forget about the real world and get culture shock the next time you go home and no one berates you from a balcony or suffers through a half-hour wait for nachos at 3 a.m.  By night, I.V. is the closest modern resemblance to Tortuga Island in Pirates of the Caribbean. It’s like Thizz-neyland.</p>\n<p>As a school that prides itself in being environmentally conscious (#10 in the Sierra Ranking), we also generate a shit-ton of trash in the form of red cups, incinerated furniture and general waste.  We’ve consistently had the highest voter registration rate of any college in the nation, and we are the 22nd most socially conscious campus (Washington Monthly) and one of the top 25 LGBT-friendly campuses in the country (Campus Pride Index). Yet we still lack the socio-economic diversity of most other UC’s, with the highest average parental income of any UC and the smallest proportion of minority groups.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Demographics are shifting though, and this year’s freshmen are the most diverse and academically lauded of any class in the school’s history.

According to Choate, there are currently a total of 26 lights with bulbs needing replacement and eight areas identified as insufficiently lit, including portions of Camino Corto, Estero Road and Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>According to Choate, the primary task the project involves is documenting and reporting the numerous missing or obstructed lights to Southern California Edison, which is then obligated to file working orders to have these lights fixed. The group eventually hopes to make this assessment an official duty of the EVPLA Office or hold periodical ‘lighting walks’ to monitor the situation and keep SCE accountable for repairs, Choate said.</p>\n<p>Choate said there is no statistical data showing that lack of lighting leads to more crime in certain areas, but based on the information the group has collected the possibility of a link seems likely.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to see if there is a correlation between crimes that have occurred in certain areas and the lack of lighting in I.V.,” Choate said. “I actually was one of the people who walked the streets and took down all this information as to which lights are out, and from what I’ve heard and what I’ve seen from the emergency alerts, there’s a pretty good chance there will be a correlation.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Parks Department Board of Directors member Sawyeh Maghsoodloo said the lack of lighting is a serious detriment to the safety of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“When it’s dark, it’s easier to get away with crime. Studies have shown that in more well-lit areas, crime rates do go down, especially in regard to sexual assault,” Maghsoodloo said. “These are problems we do have in I.V. Undeniably, we do have lighting issues — a lot of the lights haven’t been replaced in who knows how long. Replacing them is one easy step we can take to not only increase safety but to also make residents feel safer, which I think is also important.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD is working extensively with the group to find ways to implement additional lighting.</p>\n<p>According to EVPLA Rhandy Siordia, the project has also prompted Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor Doreen Farr to compose a letter addressing the problem, which will likely be signed by A.S. members.</p>\n<p>“The county is being supportive and willing to sign a letter to send to SoCal Edison, and they’ve become a very enthusiastic partner in this project,” Siordia said. “I really, really am pleased to see that because you don’t see areas like Montecito that have dim lighting areas, where [the] population isn’t as transitional as our college community.”</p>\n<p>The group is looking into raising funds that will finance solar lighting or new transformers to install in particularly problematic areas, Siordia said.</p>\n<p>“Estero Road has no lights at all. That’s very sad that there are community members on that street who for whatever reason do not have any lights there, and it’s dangerous,” Siordia said. “It’s a basic need that we realistically shouldn’t have to be fighting this hard for, but we’re going to fight hard for it nonetheless.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/","id":3105,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3104,3103,3102],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Legislative Council Discusses Next Year’s Budget","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council spent the majority of last night’s meeting discussing the specifics of their impacted 2011-2012 budget.

Representatives deliberated over the most effective areas to make cuts, focusing on honoraria and ongoing projects.</p>\n<p>Most of the debate centered on whether finances for the proposed A.S. Isla Vista Annex would come from unallocated funds or the budgets of various A.S. subcommittees that have already donated about $40,000 collectively. Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said requiring further funding from committees would limit their ability to function.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I don’t like taking most of it from committees,” Mayorga said. “They’ve already invested so much in the space and cutting their budget is going to hurt the work they will be doing in the space. The money should come out of unallocated [funds].”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Cori Lantz said funding from committees is a necessary means of determining whether or not the project is viable.</p>\n<p>“This is really a trial run — a chance for us to see if this is something beneficial so if it doesn’t work we can pull out,” Lantz said. “The committees want this to happen and will do everything in their power to see it happen.”</p>\n<p>However, Lantz said students should ultimately determine the project’s fate via a lock-in fee on next year’s Spring Election ballot.</p>\n<p>To absorb requisite cutbacks, Representative-at-Large Chloe Stryker said committee member’s honoraria should constitute a smaller portion of the association’s budget.</p>\n<p>“If you look at our budget, most of our fees are going towards honoraria,” Stryker said. “I don’t think that’s right. Members should be working out of good heart and because they want to be involved.”</p>\n<p>According to Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht, honoraria currently comprises an excessive portion of A.S. finances.</p>\n<p>“Honoraria is the most expensive thing we pay for,” Lieberknecht said. “People give to this association to get something back and not just pay for our salaries.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council deliberated Finance Board’s request for $23,075 from next year’s unallocated budget, $19,000 of which would go toward the group’s honoraria. Lieberknecht said she feels such a substantial request is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>“You should cut our honoraria,” Lieberknecht said. “Most of the money requested would be going towards honoraria.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually decided to approve $21,600 for the board.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/","id":3130,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3129,3128,3127],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Finance Board on Monday, Hillel sought $1,700 from the council to organize its weekly Shabbat dinners and Kosher cookouts. However, the organization intended to spend $1,100 on cleaning fees and supplies for these events and only $600 for food.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Dina Varshavsky said 14 percent of the campus community is composed of Jewish students. She said these dinners are an important part of their heritage and should receive full funding.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez, on the other hand, said Hillel’s financial request was excessive.</p>\n<p>“I understand that they want a lot of people to come to their dinners,” Lopez said. “Personally I’d like to cut it down a lot because it is very spread out and we can only fund it so many times.”</p>\n<p>The council ultimately allotted $50 to each event.</p>\n<p>Additionally, council members discussed investing $2,000 into the Chinese Internet company Qihoo 360 Tech. This investment was recommended by A.S. Investment Advisory Committee Representative Jordan Nuni and swiftly approved with no opposition.</p>\n<p>“This company is the number two browser and number one in mobile security,” Nuni said. “Their sales are up 82 percent right now and most of their money comes from advertising.”</p>\n<p>The council also recognized the resignation of Queer Commission Co-Chair Edgar Vargas.</p>\n<p>University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid said Vargas was initially considered for removal, but came before the council and resigned for personal reasons instead.</p>\n<p>“Basically it was a matter of internal issues about the leadership not being able to fulfill certain duties that they were expected to fill,” Del Cid said. “Eventually the commission decided the best way to do it was to ask Edgar to resign because he had other priorities in his personal life.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Duncan Kenney introduced a resolution to support the construction of a new Isla Vista annex. The community center would house 15 boards, commissions and committees — nine of which currently have no office space — computer lab and community garden, among other space for UCSB students to access in I.V. A pet project of the External Vice President for Local Affairs’ office, the building would costs $82,060 annually to operate, and needs $34,560 more to begin its initial year. The resolution was tabled indefinitely until financial issues were sorted out.</p>\n<p>Kenney said his bill was not seeking funding for the project, but a reaffirmation of Associated Students’ continued support for the plan.</p>\n<p>“It is important that we continue our support of the I.V. annex, despite some recent negative media attention,” Kenney said. “Personally, I want to make a long-term impact and this is something that will be good for committees to come and that we can come back to as alumni.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council approved three retroactive honoraria requests including $100 for Coastal Fund Graduate Representative Suzanne McFerran, $20 for the Tech Services Committee and $600 for Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis. These salaries were distributed to committee members who didn’t receive funds in a timely manner.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36780\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36780\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/","id":3127,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3126,3125,3124],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leg Council Funds A.S.

Election Committee’s funding for their “Votetopia” campaign to mobilize student participation in the Spring Election during last night’s five-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>The Council allocated additional funding for Votetopia from its Special Projects account to supplement the funding it received after originally requesting $7,543 from Finance Board to rent Corwin Pavilion and provide four times as many T-shirts for the event. The Council approved an allocation of $2,200 to the campaign, including $800 for free T-shirts, $360 for stickers and $200 for the results announcement.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair Sunjeet Gill said although over 40 percent of undergraduate students voted in last year’s Spring Election, she hopes the campaign will motivate an even higher turnout.</p>\n<p>“These shirts can be worn year after year and we thought the theme would be fun,” Gill said. “We want more and more of a percentage to get out and vote each year.”</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said she thinks it will be difficult to distribute the T-shirts during the association’s four-day campaign.</p>\n<p>“I did a month-long campaign once and even then it was hard to give away T-shirts with heavy publicizing,” Mayorga said. “There are so many T-shirts being given out already that it might be an overload.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Jason Lopez said he feels the Elections Committee has already spent an excessive amount on advertising for Spring Elections.</p>\n<p>“My main issue with this is that they paid almost $10,000 in ads,” Lopez said. “People who read the Nexus generally read it every day and they don’t need to see these ads in issue after issue.”</p>\n<p>Some representatives suggested cost-cutting options such as announcing election results at a smaller venue and using an MP3 player instead of hiring a DJ.</p>\n<p>The Council also passed a Resolution to Support the Execution of the Student-Initiated Democratic Education, a program that would allow undergraduate students to teach pass/no pass seminars.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Council approved a Resolution to Support the Implementation of the A.S. Food Bank. According to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, the food bank will be operational shortly.</p>\n<p>The Council continued discussion about plans for their Isla Vista Annex and A.S. café. An informational meeting about the café will be held in the MultiCultural Center’s Multi-Purpose Room on April 28.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/","id":3160,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3159,3158,3157],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/205"}},"__N_SSG":true}
