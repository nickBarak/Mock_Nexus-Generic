Office of the President, is intended to inform students about the expected campus-level consequences of California Governor Jerry Brown’s proposed $500 million cut to the UC. A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, Presidential Leadership Fellow Hadar Dor and Commissioner for Budget Resources Armando Guerrero will serve as the event’s coordinators.</p>\n<p>Monge-Rodriguez said the forum aims to clear up confusion about the University’s finances and allow opportunities for student participation.</p>\n<p>“Many students see and feel the effects of budget cuts but often don’t understand the source of these cuts or who the key decision-makers are in administering them,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “Beyond providing information, we hope to create a space for dialogue where students have the opportunity to counsel UCSB administrators on how to make budgetary decisions in a way that is sensitive to our wants and needs.”</p>\n<p>Campus administrators and faculty members including Executive Vice Chancellor Gene Lucas, Assistant Chancellor Todd Lee, Dean of Undergraduate Education Mary Nisbet and economics professor Henning Bohn will also be present.</p>\n<p>According to Guerrero, the forum will facilitate discussion between campus decision-makers and the student body.</p>\n<p>“A goal that we have is to make the administrators more accessible to the students,” Guerrero said. “We want to try to get the information that circulates among administrators to students.”</p>\n<p>The event will consist of five-minute presentations on budget updates by administrators followed by a Q&amp;A session. According to Dor, the A.S. Office of the President plans to use student input from the forum to develop future budget policies.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to decide ourselves what is important for the student body,” Dor said. “Our role is to find out what the student body wants and then advocate for them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37326\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37326\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/holds-event-inform-students-budget-issues/","id":3132,"author":{"id":212,"name":"Dominic LoBuglio"},"related":[3131,3130,3129],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Additionally, the board discussed potentially videotaping council meetings, Governor Jerry Brown’s proposed 2011-2012 budget and efforts to create a student-run cooperative café in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Lambda Theta Alpha and Lambda Theta Phi members John Salas and Lidia Rivas, respectively, requested $1,350 to fund t-shirts and food for an upcoming event encouraging low-income high school students to pursue higher education.</p>\n<p>Rivas and Salas said UCSB sociology assistant professor Victor Rios agreed to speak at the event for free if organizers bought a copy of one of his books for each participant.</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez said the arrangement would violate University policy.</p>\n<p>“UC faculty cannot be paid for speaking anywhere in the UC,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>After reviewing its budget records, A.S. Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht discovered that the association had already funded the group $1,100 in November. The council eventually allotted an additional $500 for food and $168 to donate eight of Rios’ textbooks to the four participating high school libraries.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov submitted a proposal to record legislative council meetings. Tzankov said the recordings would not only create more transparency within A.S., but also prevent campus media outlets from misquoting council members.</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez said recording meetings could deter council members from voicing their opinions.</p>\n<p>To avoid calling attention to closed meetings, Tzankov said the council could post recordings after the meetings in lieu of releasing a live feed.</p>\n<p>“Last year there were … issues that came up and we had to go into a closed meeting and so I don’t know if a live feed is the way to go,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>According to University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid, recording meetings could make the council more accessible to the student body.</p>\n<p>“To us, A.S. is this great thing, but to many students it seems like this exclusive group,” Del Cid said. “[Recording meetings is] definitely better. … Most students don’t want to go through lines of minutes.”</p>\n<p>The proposal was ultimately tabled for future consideration.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Off-Campus Representative Kaily Burton said the council is considering funding a student-run restaurant at the former site of On The Side on Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>Burton said the restaurant, which would be modeled after a similar venture in Berkeley, would sell locally grown organic foods.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31979\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31979\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/","id":3152,"author":{"id":212,"name":"Dominic LoBuglio"},"related":[3151,3150,3149],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/212"}},"__N_SSG":true}
