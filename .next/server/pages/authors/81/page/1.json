U-mail accounts will still be accessible through the “U-Mail Web Access” link found on the UCSB U-mail website, according to Amstutz.</p>\n<p>In addition to current email addresses, UCSBNetID@umail.ucsb.edu, students will also have the option of using a new domain name, UCSBNetID@ucsb.edu.</p>\n<p>The CIO recommends that students frequently check their emails and pay attention to any emails detailing the transition of their account.</p>\n<p>“The best thing you can do to prepare is to watch your email and actually read them because you will get an email that lets you know exactly what day [the email server] is swapping for you … That’s all students need to do,” Amstutz said.</p>\n<p>The CIO is working on completing the transition of emails for the Student Affairs division, Kantrim said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>. This will complete the migration for the entire UC Santa Barbara faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Approximately 12,377 out of 15,222 email accounts of UCSB staff and faculty have been fully transitioned to Google as of March 2018, according to Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for information technology and chief information officer.</p>\n<p>In a 2016 study done by Student Information Systems &amp; Technology (SIS&amp;T), the university found 65 percent of students with Office 365 U-mail accounts were forwarding their emails to other servers. Of those forwarding, 64 percent of emails were being sent to Gmail.</p>\n<p>Students had proposed switching to Gmail when the university first switched from a local email server to Office 365 in 2012. However, the Google platform at the time was difficult to manage and was not as developed as it is today, according to Joe Sabado, SIS&amp;T executive director.</p>\n<p>The transition to the Google server will allow students, faculty and staff to be on the same platform and easily share documents, calendars and improve overall collaboration, Sabado said.</p>\n<p>Although Gmail provides multi-factor authentication, email phishing and other malware will not see a significant change, according to Sam Horowitz, CIO chief information security officer.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, a mailbox is a mailbox,” Horowitz said in an email. “People still need to be careful with email.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: James Kantrim is the Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) service delivery manager, not the Student Information Systems &amp;

This would result in the loss of four to five one-way trips per weekday. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>At an Isla Vista Community Services District (IVCSD) meeting on Tuesday, Hillary Blackerby, MTD marketing and community relations manager, presented the changes to the CSD, the first time the MTD has presented to the I.V. governance board.</p>\n<p>Before the creation of the CSD, the MTD held community meetings in various locations in Isla Vista, Goleta and Santa Barbara to propose service changes.</p>\n<p>Line 15x, the SBCC/UCSB Express, runs between SBCC, UCSB and Isla Vista. The suggested changes would improve time performance, simplify the bus route and create more access to SBCC.</p>\n<p>The line will no longer switch directions midday which has previously caused confusion and delay, according to Blackerby. Bus service on Friday between 4:30 and 6:30 p.m. will also be eliminated as there are very few classes at that time.</p>\n<p>Lines 7, 10 and 27 will see “minor” changes that would overall improve time performance, Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>The changes on line 27, the Isla Vista Shuttle, include adding more time to each trip in order to decrease the delays. This would result in the loss of four to five one-way trips per weekday.</p>\n<p>“It takes a while to get through I.V. in a bus because of all the congestion on the street and obviously to get through safely we need to go slow […] When you do something like that [adding time to each trip] it’s not very noticeable,” Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>The MTD will also temporarily discontinue line 21x, Carpinteria Express, until the Highway 101 HOV lanes are opened.</p>\n<p>Every April, the MTD informs the communities they serve of the upcoming changes to the bus services, which are then officially put into effect in August of that same year.</p>\n<p>A year ago, the MTD p<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/\">roposed new fareboxes</a> that would allow UCSB students to tap their ID cards on the farebox instead of showing a sticker that is given out every quarter.</p>\n<p>This new technology has been implemented in a few buses and, according to Blackery, the MTD is “getting close” to fully integrating the new fareboxes.</p>\n<p>IVCSD Board Secretary Spencer Brandt brought up the possibility of creating or modifying a bus line that would allow students to access Calle Real/Fairview marketplaces, which includes stores like Trader Joe’s.</p>\n<p>According to Google Maps, students can take either the 11 or 24x bus lines toward Goleta and walk 20 to 30 minutes to get to the Calle Real Shopping Center, or take either of those buses and transfer to the number 7, Goleta Old Town, line and walk a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Since its start in August 2016, Line 28 has been a “rousing success” to the point where the MTD will eventually require more support from UCSB, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said that both of these issues are being discussed at MTD.</p>\n<p>Blackerby also said that because line 28 buses often get filled to capacity at the El Colegio and Camino Corto stop across Santa Catalina, people looking to get on at different stops along El Colegio are sometimes “out of luck.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print

The building was deemed unstable in 2017 due to various structural problems, promting students and alumni to call for its repair and the preservation of its history. <em>Kaitlyn Ngyuen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>El Centro, which sits on sunken ground between the library and Broida Hall, has historically been a gathering place for Latinx students and activists. The building provides working space for campus organizations including M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB, El Congreso, Students for Justice in Palestine and the conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>The reconstruction cost approximately $900,000, funded by Student Affairs and partially funded by the deferred maintenance program.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day vacate notice after a report from the Van Sande Structural Consultant group confirmed various structural issues including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>After the eviction notice, students and alumni voiced their frustration toward the administration for seemingly ignoring the requests of the occupants to repair the building, according to Shahryar Mooraj, a fourth-year mathematical science and physics double major and member of the El Centro Committee.</p>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/\">passed a resolution</a> a few weeks later that supported the restoration of the building and by April 2017 the administration had decided against the demolition of the historic building.</p>\n<p>A committee of students and administrators was then created to discuss the conditions of the new building and to discuss what was needed.</p>\n<p>“As students, we came together to stop that and to fight for the history and the culture that has been built in that space over time and to ensure that El Centro has a permanent physical space on campus,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>The space was created as a response to the lack of representation and support from the UCSB administration for the Latinx community, which additionally led to the creation of the Chicana/o Studies department and support programs like EOP, according to Mooraj.</p>\n<p>A 10-day hunger strike by Chicanx student activists in 1994 pushed the UCSB administration to make El Centro a permanent space after the trailer had been given a life-span of 10 years and had not been considered a permanent building.</p>\n<p>“The space of El Centro was allocated in the late ’70s, early ’80s to give students of color a place to congregate, a place to meet where they could feel welcomed on campus during a time when that really wasn’t the case,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>“Since then, it’s been a center for community organizing and activism in terms of fighting for different things that students need,” he added.</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, students at El Centro continually fought for the permanency and improvement of the building, including insect and mold inspections and requests for a hydration station, which was eventually installed late 2016.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the entire portion of the building that was previously a trailer was remodeled, except for the wood stud walls and plywood siding and the wood roof rafters and plywood roofing.</p>\n<p>The trailer now has a concrete foundation, a drainage system to prevent flooding during the rainy season and new wiring that improves the lights and Wi-Fi connection in the building.</p>\n<p>Mooraj said that some offices were remodeled to create a conference room and a kitchen. Ten feet of space was also added to the main activity room.</p>\n<p>New furniture, monitors and salvaged art pieces from the original building now adorn the reconstructed student hub.</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, the new building is expected to be a permanent location for El Centro, and there will be regular upkeep and maintenance.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and Early Academic Outreach Program are currently operating from the building. A psychologist from Counseling and Psychological Services will also be accessible on the first floor of the building.</p>\n<p>“We have a signed agreement with the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and other administration that El Centro will be a permanent physical space and that it will remain where it is today,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

would be built to fit Camacho’s needs. The cost of converting a vehicle into a food truck ranges from $95,000 to $120,000. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho has been selling raspados, mangonadas and other treats in Isla Vista and UCSB for the past three years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the campaign’s creation in February, $490 out of the $85,000 goal has been raised. The $85,000 primary goal is to cover the cost of a “professional” food cart as well as permits and insurance Camacho needs to sell on campus, according to the campaign’s </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/HijinoEloteroman\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M.U.J.E.R. co-chair and third-year sociology major Dulce Gonzalez</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created the campaign in hopes of gathering financial and community support for Camacho’s return to campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign was first posted on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale page on Facebook, and organizers have been tagging larger news outlets like Univision and Mitù in hopes to gain support beyond the UCSB community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve tried to collaborate with him because he’s not only trying to get back on campus to fundraise and help student orgs out with their fundraising, but we also want to try to expand his business,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho hopes to raise enough funds to help him purchase a food truck from a vendor in Los Angeles that would be built to fit Camacho’s needs. The cost of converting a vehicle into a food truck ranges from $95,000 to $120,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Sep. 2017, the Office of Student Life and the office for Environmental Health and Safety have implemented regulations that require vendors like Camacho to obtain either a Temporary Food Service permit, which has a fee of approximately $180, or a Mobile Food Facility permit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A general liability insurance that covers up to approximately $2 million in coverage is also required. The yearly payment for general liability insurance for a food cart vendor can range from $500 to $1000 a year, according to Brashears Insurance. For a food truck, the yearly payment can cost between $5,000 to $7,500 a year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho has since held fundraisers in Isla Vista but has experienced issues with the county food inspectors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has been asked to remove his stand by inspectors due to the proximity of a public restroom from his food booth, although he does have the necessary permits to sell in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He believes that a food truck would allow him to comfortably sell both on campus and in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unos de mi mayores gustos es trabajar con los estudiantes.

By providing a safe space and a location to receive assistance, A.S. reinforces Dreamers’ inclusion in the UCSB community. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The resolution was authored by A.S. Senators Steven Ho and Brandon Mora and sponsored by fourth-year psychology major Lezli B. and fourth-year economics and accounting major Karla L.</p>\n<p>The list of demands include hiring a full-time immigration attorney and an additional undocumented students program coordinator, providing additional financial aid options and internship opportunities for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>I.D.E.A.S. previously presented their demands to UCSB Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn, but there has been “little action [taken],” Lezli said.</p>\n<p>They will be meeting with the administration on Friday to further discuss these demands.</p>\n<p>“We just want administration to know that it’s not just [I.D.E.A.S.] behind this. We hope that the administration sees this and sees the importance of [the resolution] because we’ve been trying to get these demands passed for a while,” Karla L. said.</p>\n<p>The list also includes a proposed expansion of the current center for undocumented students on campus, the Monarch Lounge, which opened in April 2017.</p>\n<p>Plans for the expansion of the Monarch Lounge include adding an additional study space, a conference room, an office for the Undocumented Student Services (USS) Coordinator, an office for the immigration attorney, a front desk, kitchen, gender-neutral bathrooms and a workspace for an USS intern.</p>\n<p>These demands are expected to “[improve] the quality of life for undocumented students on campus,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, “undocumented students account for at least 800 undergraduate students” and over 800,000 Dreamers are currently affected by the repeal of DACA, putting these students in “vulnerable” positions.</p>\n<p>The resolution also addressed UCSB and Isla Vista’s history of I.C.E. raids and the overall fear undocumented students may experience on campus.</p>\n<p>Opportunities for undocumented students are limited because most jobs and internships require a social security number, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Financial aid is also limited and often doesn’t meet the needs of undocumented students, according to the resolution. The status of these students also impacts their ability to secure housing and sources of income.</p>\n<p>“We’re glad this is a step forward to know that there are leaders of our student body supporting us,” Karla L. said.</p>\n<p>Legal support for undocumented students on campus is available through University of California Immigrant Legal Services Center, which operates out of the UC Davis School of Law.</p>\n<p>Attorneys from the center visit UC campuses two to three times a quarter, according to the law school’s website.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, the only attorney UCSB students have access to is currently located at UC San Diego and is “constantly overbooked.”</p>\n<p>“Many of us will not be able to pursue a life in the U.S. We should equally benefit and experience that UCSB aims to provide for every student,” Karla L. said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 3 of the March 1, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/a-s-senate-affirms-support-for-undocumented-students/","id":2329,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2328,2327,2326],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate meeting. It states that UCSB should partner with Sprigeo, a third-party vendor, to offer students a 24/7 mobile application, webform, text hotline, phone hotline and email hotline to report a crime.</p>\n<p>If the Senate passes the resolution, A.S. would establish a contract with Sprigeo for the service and “widely publicize” the app to incoming students as a way to report sexual assault on campus and in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of partnering with this company is that so many resources in Associated Students are available and we pay for them, but no students know they exist or they don’t know how to access them, and that’s a huge issue,” said Senator Kristen Armellini, who co-authored the resolution with Senator Grecia Martinez.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Matan Bostick sponsored the resolution.</p>\n<p>The Sprigeo app would allow students to anonymously report offenses that would then be processed by “designated university officials and [be] appropriately and confidentially responded to in prompt fashion,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Following a lengthy debate, the Senate sent the resolution to External Affairs to be discussed further.</p>\n<p>Before voting, some senators expressed disappointment with how the subject was approached.</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse said that the Senate had last spoken to Bostick two weeks before, but that the updated resolution was “slapped on” the night before the meeting.</p>\n<p>She added that the resolution should have been created in conjunction with current student efforts to combat sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I have a problem with [the resolution] is that no one is doing anything unless it makes them look real good, or they care about it and they’re caring about it when they’re not prioritizing other issues,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The amount of time allotted to work on the resolution was also a point of concern for some senators because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p>\n<p>“This resolution shouldn’t be worked in a week. It should be worked in one month, two months, three months,” Senator Andrea Reyes said.</p>\n<p>Another issue addressed was the use of the names of two UCSB alumni in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The alumni mentioned have previously hosted sit-ins regarding sexual assault. The first was held by Alejandra Melgoza in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 2015</a> and lasted for 13 hours; the second was led by Ro’Shawndra Earvin in May 2017 and lasted for nine hours.</p>\n<p>In both instances, Chancellor Henry T. Yang agreed to the students’ <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nowUCsb13InitialDemandsforChancellorYang.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">respective demands</a>, although Earvin has continued fighting for the completion of the demands, most recently at a Feb. 8 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-09/sexual-assault-survivors-raise-frustrations-over-unresolved-demands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Town Hall meeting</a>.</p>\n<p>Both Melgoza and Earvin said they were not contacted by the authors of the resolution or asked to have their names included.</p>\n<p>“Using my name without consent is perpetuating the same acts of violence,” Melgoza said during public forum.</p>\n<p>Armellini spoke about the intentions of the resolution, saying it came “prematurely” to the senate and that it “needs work”.</p>\n<p>“In no way was this resolution supposed to produce this anxiety and uproar,” she said.</p>\n<p>Currently, students can report incidents of sexual assault through the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) if the incident occurs on campus or through the Title IX &amp; Sexual Harassment Policy Compliance Office. Local law enforcement like the Isla Vista Foot Patrol can address an incident if it occurred off campus.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) is another campus resource students can use to anonymously report sexual assault. Students can go online to file a report, which will then be forwarded to UCPD and other campus offices.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Stephan Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Camacho needs to provide proof of insurance to resume selling on campus, according to the Office of Student Life (OSL). OSL has recommended an insurance provider and has contacted Camacho to ask about his progress towards meeting the school’s requirements.</p>\n<p>The insurance required by the university needs to cover up to $2 million in liability, which is a monthly payment Camacho says he cannot afford.</p>\n<p>Days before Fall Quarter began, Camacho learned that he and other off-campus vendors would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/\">no longer be allowed</a> to sell on campus because the vendors’ sales violate Environmental Health and Safety policies regarding vendors unaffiliated with the university.</p>\n<p>OSL<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/elotero-could-return-to-srb-soon-pending-permits/\"> later clarified</a> the requirements needed for off-campus vendors to sell on campus. Camacho explained, however, that he would not be returning to the campus because the costs of the required permits and insurance would outweigh the benefits of selling one day of the month or even one day out of the week.</p>\n<p>Camacho sold in Isla Vista throughout Fall Quarter, even while Santa Barbara was under “hazardous” air quality due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a> during December.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cuando tengo contracto con los estudiantes tengo que venir, sea lluvia o calor.</em>”</p>\n<p>“When I have a contract with the students, I have an obligation to come, rain or shine,” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>Camacho situates his canopy on Pardall Road and alternates between Isla Vista street corners, where the traffic provides more opportunity for sales.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80412\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"977929887\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80442\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80412\" data-attachment-id=\"80412\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/high-insurance-costs-prevent-el-elotero-from-selling-on-campus/hijinio-by-stephan-manga-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1274&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1274\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hijinio by Stephan Manga ONLINE-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C565&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-80412\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1-1024x652.jpg?resize=888%2C565\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C652&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hijinio-by-Stephan-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephan Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Camacho’s business is currently registered as a business within California, and he is in the process of finalizing the permits that would allow him to sell on Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>County regulations require temporary food facilities to provide a cleaning station, use only prepackaged foods and clearly display permits and other paperwork.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Anthony Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Office of Student Life (OSL), Campus Concessions and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety have clarified the requirements necessary for off-campus vendors like Camacho to sell on campus with student organizations.</p>\n<p>Camacho is currently working to obtain the necessary insurance and permits to work on campus again.</p>\n<p>Once UCSB approves Camacho’s current food permit and an insurance policy, he can sell with campus organizations once a month.</p>\n<p>“The next time we could see Mr. Camacho selling on campus is after he submits his certificate of insurance and is listed on the Approved Caterers list,” Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, said.</p>\n<p>According to Ashlock, the insurance policy can be obtained “in a matter of days, not weeks.”</p>\n<p>OSL’s requirements outline the steps for vendors to become fully certified to sell on campus, including a prerequisite that vendors have the necessary permits and insurance prior to selling.</p>\n<p>The university prohibited Camacho from selling on campus at the beginning of Fall Quarter because he did not have the correct permits and insurance, the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/\">reported</a> in October.</p>\n<p>Camacho met with OSL on Oct. 17 to discuss the new process of selling with on campus organizations.</p>\n<p>University vendors must first contact Campus Concessions for permission to sell on campus, according to OSL. Campus Concessions will then grant permission to sell if the vendor is on the university’s approved caterers list.</p>\n<p>Vendors on the approved caterers list must have general liability insurance that covers up to $2 million in liability and include the Regents of the University of California in the coverage.</p>\n<p>The university also requires that vendors have a Mobile Food Facility (MFF) permit or a general Santa Barbara County permit. The MFF permits range from $130 to $200 depending on the type of food sold and allows for vendors to sell on campus once a week.</p>\n<p>After the vendor is approved to sell on campus, they must fill out the Food Permit Application with Campus Concessions and awaits further approval from OSL and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.</p>\n<p>According to OSL’s regulations, vendors with a non-MFF food permit and an insurance that meets UCSB’s requirements will be allowed to sell only once a month. A vendor with insurance and a MFF type food permit will be able to sell once a week.</p>\n<p>Qualifying vendors may only sell at the SRB and only one off-campus vendor is allowed to sell per day.</p>\n<p>OSL met with representatives from student organizations on Oct. 20 to clarify the requirements and process of using off-campus vendors for fundraisers.</p>\n<p>The current off-campus vendors list has 26 approved vendors, including Silvergreens and Woodstock’s Pizza, and 29 vendors that are not approved to sell on campus. Camacho is not currently on the approved caterers list or the non-approved vendors list.</p>\n<p>Once the university approves a vendor for on-campus sales, the vendor will receive four complementary food permits from Campus Concessions. All permit after the fourth will cost $50 and each permit is valid for one day.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year, students noticed Camacho’s absence and questioned why he was no longer selling at the SRB.</p>\n<p>Jorge Santos, an Associated Students on-campus senator, said he contacted OSL to learn more about Camacho’s situation. Santos addressed the issues surrounding Camacho’s permission to sell on campus in a Facebook post on Oct. 25.</p>\n<p>“The Office of Student Life not only reached out to [Camacho] but have worked and are doing the most they can to get him back on campus as soon as possible.” Santos’ post read.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 2, edition of the</em> Daily

however, the university has prohibited Camacho and other off-campus vendors from selling on campus with student organizations.</p>\n<p>According to the Office of Student Life (OSL), the vendors’ sales violate the Environmental Health and Safety policies regarding food vendors unaffiliated with the university. OSL is only allowed to grant permits to campus organizations, not the companies and vendors who work with them.</p>\n<p>For the past two years, off-campus vendors have been allowed to sell products alongside student organizations with permits granted by OSL.</p>\n<p>According to Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, the office wasn’t fully aware the vendors were violating university policies until a meeting on Sept. 25 with the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Pienso quedarme aquí porque aquí es donde yo he visto que los estudiantes te tratan como tal y como tú eres y no te distinguen porque no seas una persona educada, porque no seas una persona civilizada.”</p>\n<p>— Hijinio Camacho</p></blockquote>\n<p>Camacho said he was notified about the policy reinforcements two days before school started. He then met with OSL on the first day of school to understand why he was no longer permitted to work with student organizations on campus.</p>\n<p>His first event of the school year was a fundraiser with the UCSB Promise Scholars.</p>\n<p>Camacho had planned events with Seoul’d Out, Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), <em>Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion, y Revolucion</em>, (M.U.J.E.R.) and the Latino Business Association.

Student organizations would typically keep 15 percent of the profit from the shared fundraisers.</p>\n<p>OSL, UCSB Concessions and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety are currently creating “more inclusive policies” that will lift the current restrictions surrounding off-campus vendors and allow vendors like Camacho to continue to work with student organizations.</p>\n<p>“We really want to figure out how to add [off-campus vendor permits] to the sorts of permits we are able to approve…both because it’s a good fundraising mechanism for them but also it has been a positive contribution to our campus,” Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>Camacho met with OSL on Tuesday and told the <em>Nexus</em> he now needs two more permits from the university to work with student organizations. The two permits will allow him to sell on campus either once a week or once a month.</p>\n<p>Ashlock said the sudden policy revision further contributed to the frustration and confusion felt by both the students and the vendors because some vendors, like Camacho, already had events planned with student groups.</p>\n<p>“I have been been really clear with every conversation with my colleagues on how important it is that we figure this out, that we figure it out quickly, but also give good and clear advice,” Ashlock said. “That’s why it’s taking a little longer.”</p>\n<p>Camacho, who hails from Puebla, Mexico, has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. He spent time in I.V. during the early years of his time in the U.S. but found little success due to the demographic at the time.</p>\n<p>“When I arrived [in I.V.]… two years after arriving to this country, at that time there was mainly Asians and white people. It was 10 percent Latino,” Camacho said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79154\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"764019501\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79193\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79154\" data-attachment-id=\"79154\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/img_1111/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elote Hijinio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79154 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79154\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Camacho has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. <em>Anthony Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Upon his return to Isla Vista two years ago, however, Camacho noticed more students of Latino descent at UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB was categorized as a Hispanic Serving Institute by the Association of Colleges and Universities in 2015 and has a 28 percent Chicano/Latino population, according to the 2016-2017 campus profile published by the Office of Budget and Planning.</p>\n<p>The rise in street food popularity over the years has opened the gates to members outside of the Latino community to indulge in Mexican snacks found on push-carts like Camacho’s.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been looking for you for two years!” exclaimed Jacqueline Liu, a third-year global studies and psychology double major, as she approached Camacho’s cart last week. Liu said she remembers living in a Mexican community as a child and taking money from her mother’s purse so she and her brother could buy snacks from their local elotero.</p>\n<p>With a large and increasing fan club comes busy schedules, as Camacho’s days often begin at 3 a.m. when he needs to pick up merchandise, ending at sundown when his day of selling is over.</p>\n<p>On other days, he arrives in I.V. at around 3 p.m. and begins his route on Picasso Road at Children’s Park, making his way down Embarcadero del Norte and down Pardall Road, with a stop in front of Freebirds along the way. From there he goes to Abrego Road and circles back onto Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>Camacho also created a Venmo account two years ago that allowed customers to buy from him without using cash. He has also made a Snapchat account with a Bitmoji character so customers can now locate him when he is in I.V. His username is “hijiniocamacho1.”</p>\n<p>Camacho has also sold food in Los Angeles, Oxnard, Santa Barbara, Sacramento and Lompoc.</p>\n<p>In these cities, Camacho has been stopped by the police and forced to surrender his money and merchandise, as well as been robbed by local gangs. He said street vendors like himself encounter these obstacles on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Recent news coverage of street vendors has made their struggles visible to the public, but it only shows a small amount of what really goes on, Camacho said.</p>\n<p>The working conditions in the other cities pulled Camacho back to I.V. but he said even here he has faced issues with a local police officer.</p>\n<p>“<em>No es fácil andar en la calle</em> [It’s not easy being on the streets],” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>Despite the recent pause in selling on campus, Camacho said he hopes to stay in I.V. and continue to work with student organizations.</p>\n<p><em>“Pienso quedarme aquí porque aquí es donde yo he visto que los estudiantes te tratan como tal y como tú eres y no te distinguen porque no seas una persona educada, porque no seas una persona civilizada,” </em>Camacho said.<em> “Ellos te tratan tal y como eres porque ellos si se están preparando.”</em></p>\n<p>“Now that I’ve arrived for a second time, I’m thinking of staying here because here is where I have seen that the students treat you just like you are and don’t judge you because you’re not an educated person, because you’re not a civilized person,” Camacho said. “They treat you just as you are because they are preparing themselves [for their futures].”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79193\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79193\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/","id":2343,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2342,2341,2340],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Career Services To Replace Gaucholink with New Jobs Database","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-30-at-3.40.53-PM.png?resize=355%2C224&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-30-at-3.40.53-PM.png?resize=745%2C224&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Career Services plans to replace in June its online jobs database, Gaucholink, with a new website called Handshake.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Career Services plans to replace in June its online jobs database, Gaucholink, with a new website called Handshake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake is a website that connects over 170,000 schools with over 120,000 employers across the nation, including 95 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Students can expect to receive an email invitation to join Handshake around June 16. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services suggests students download any important documents from Gaucholink before the end of Spring Quarter.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Gaucholink, Handshake connects students to employers and provides potential internship opportunities by allowing students to share their resumes and search and apply for jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services counselor and coordinator Eric Wilder said </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake allows students to create a “more in-depth profile,” which he said will allow them to more easily find jobs and internships as well as interact with employers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers searching to recruit college students are able to access Handshake and view the resumes of applicants, which are directly displayed on the students’ profiles, and post employment or internship opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake is designed to provide organizations with a “single login experience” in which they can find all the necessary information about a student on one interface. Career Services staffers believe this will encourage employers to interact more with the website and the students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services expects Handshake to provide an “easier” and more “user-friendly” interface that will increase communication between companies and students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB students can access a much wider array of employment and internship opportunities [with Handshake],” Wilder said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also uses algorithms “similar to the ones on Netflix” to match students with jobs or internships that correspond to their interests and areas of study. It is for this reason that Handshake provides a more “fluid experience” for both students and employers, Wilder said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake additionally allows students to look for career fairs, establish interviews with prospective employers and search for other career-related events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are looking into future rollouts that will allow students to easily identify career events and resources that match their interests,” Wilder said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78196\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78196\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/","id":2383,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2382,2381,2380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Elections Board, Students Discuss Election Safety, Sustainability, More","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-Elections-2017-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-Elections-2017-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Elections Board (ASEB) held a post-election town hall at Pardall Center Friday evening where around 15 students gathered to discuss the various issues that arose during this ye...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Elections Board (ASEB) held a post-election town hall at Pardall Center Friday evening where around 15 students gathered to discuss the various issues that arose during this year’s election in hopes of improving the overall election experience next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Director of Legislative Accountability Steven Kwok facilitated the discussion, which focused heavily on improving candidate safety as competition during elections runs strong. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">External Vice President for Local Affairs candidate Justice Dumlao was injured in a bike accident while trying to find the best place for his campaign board the Sunday before active campaign began. As a tradition, candidates gather at Pardall Tunnel on Sunday then race across campus to distribute campaign material.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, third-year biology major and transfer senator-elect, proposed a “lottery system” for assigning spots, which he said will eliminate the need for a race and increase the physical safety of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student suggested that the boards move from the bike path to the front of the library to avoid the battle of best placement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue discussed at the meeting was the structure and timeline of the election cycle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After discussion, the ASEB decided active campaigning would move to Week Two of Spring Quarter in order to allow candidates and other students involved in the election process to concentrate on their midterms. This means that elections season would end during Week Three of Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates also faced problems surrounding the rules of the declaration of candidacy. Media outlets such as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bottom Line</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported on the students’ candidacy soon after the declaration deadline at the end of Winter Quarter, but the candidates were not allowed to officially comment on their intent to run until Week Four of Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s like after declaration of candidacy you can’t acknowledge your own candidacy, which doesn’t make a lot of sense,” said Kristin Hsu, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third-year political science major and external vice president for statewide affairs-elect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several students expressed concern over the environmental implications of the campaigning boards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amy Koo, a second-year political science major, said reducing the number of boards for each party could reduce waste and encourage candidates to use other methods of campaigning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we are moving towards a waste-free UCSB, then that’s something that can be restricted,” Koo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meeting attendees agreed that the ASEB must be more involved in the campaigning process to reduce party harassment and hostility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hate the fact that we are all friends, and yet for two weeks we hate each other,” Koo said. “[It’s] just not a good system, and it just breeds a lot of hostility, and it makes us less likely to work with each other in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kwok said the tense political climate results from the “atmosphere” created between parties.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t have to be as hostile as it is,” Kwok said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/","id":2374,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2373,2372,2371],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"From Environment to Education, Calif.
