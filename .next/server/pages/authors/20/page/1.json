Food Co-op is one of a handful of grocery stores in I.V. and has been relied on by many, especially now that access to larger grocery stores outside of I.V. may be a hurdle for community members in isolation</span>. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local food-based services, such as Food Not Bombs, the I.V. Food Co-op, the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank and Manos de Mapaches, are contributing to the flurry of local support that has come out of the coronavirus pandemic with new and improved services, such as daily meal distributions and grocery pick-up programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Not Bombs, a long-standing organization in I.V., has grown to meet the community’s demand for food access. The organization usually produces two meals per week but now produces five, which volunteers hand out in various parks in I.V. for those facing food insecurity, according to its Facebook </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fnbiv\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under normal circumstances, Food Not Bombs serves free vegan meals twice a week, in which most of its food comes free from local growers and markets, such as the Goleta Farmers Market and the I.V. Food Co-op, according to Jonathan Dickstein, a religious studies graduate student who has been volunteering at Food Not Bombs for over a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large part of Food Not Bombs’ normal operations involves group cooking, but volunteers have now shifted operations to cooking separately while in isolation, according to its Facebook </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fnbiv\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Not Bombs recently partnered with I.V. Food Co-op on April 28, purchasing the store’s packaged sandwiches, fruits, snacks and drinks to be distributed by Food Not Bombs’ volunteers at a lower cost, according to Melissa Cohen, the store’s general manager. In distributing food to community members, Dickstein said Food Not Bombs operates under the framework that “food is a right, not a privilege.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Food Co-op is one of a handful of grocery stores in I.V. and has been relied on by many, especially now that access to larger grocery stores outside of I.V. may be a hurdle for community members in isolation, according to Cohen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Food Co-op has made efforts to ensure that customers who are practicing social distancing have access to groceries, such as making its inventory accessible through an online platform known as </span><a href=\"https://islavistafoodcoop.storebyweb.com/s/1000-1/?fbclid=IwAR2onQTi2MT53jva0gL07GzPez42-r5g-V6C_XIoADg9s-kLXc0czx_pAiQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-op Curbside</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Customers can purchase their groceries online and have them bagged and brought to the curb for pickup at a time of their choosing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new program also provides services to those who are homebound and unable to pick up groceries at the store. Through contacting the I.V. Food Co-op, customers from  high-risk demographics can arrange a home delivery to minimize contact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There aren’t formulas for this; these are people developing all of these programs in [real] time. It is all very people-powered,” Cohen said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the I.V. Food Co-op has not been immune to the new pressures that the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing orders place on grocery stores and other essential services, Cohen said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have run the Co-op for 10 years, through shootings and riots and wildfires, and this has been as hard as everything combined together,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from Food Not Bombs and the I.V. Food Co-op, other local programs have stepped up to the challenge of combating food insecurity during this time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manos de Mapaches, an organization based in I.V. that was created on April 15 by UC Santa Barbara students, is also delivering groceries and supplies to those most vulnerable in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group is working to address the needs of the elderly, disabled and immunocompromised by pairing each community member with a volunteer who will coordinate the grocery delivery. Volunteers are typically tasked solely with the pickup and delivery of groceries that have been paid for in advance by the person ordering the service, according to Alec Valdez, a fourth-year history of public policy and law major and the founder of Manos de Mapaches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the program, still in its infancy, has remained flexible in order to adapt to different needs, according to Valdez. Volunteers are encouraged to coordinate with the person in need of service to find the most accessible system for ordering groceries, depending on the circumstances. Anyone under the age of 40 who is in good health and meets other criteria including practicing social distancing  can volunteer with Manos de Mapaches, according to its </span><a href=\"https://manosdemapaches.wixsite.com/sbhands/volunteer-with-us\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group is also developing a project called “Community Connections,” a social exchange program in which volunteers are digitally connected to people from high-risk demographics — such as the elderly —  to relieve the loneliness that has accompanied the shelter-in-place orders, according to Valdez.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manos de Mapaches is an effort that stemmed from the Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) at UCSB, according to Valdez, who is also the co-coordinator of C.A.B. Alternative Breaks. Because Alternative Breaks’ planned volunteer operations for the quarter had been canceled, Valdez said he created Manos de Mapaches to help serve others in this new reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea for Manos de Mapaches was inspired by a group of volunteers in New York called Invisible Hands, Valdez said. Like Manos de Mapaches, Invisible Hands also provides grocery shopping and deliveries for those who are most at risk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar light, the A.S. Food Bank has teamed up with the Foodbank of Santa Barbara County and recently shifted its services to the distribution of brown bags, containing items such as pasta, beans and sauces, according to its Facebook </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbasfoodbank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. Food Bank now distributes these groceries outside the front of its location at the University Center on Wednesdays and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The A.S. Food Bank is also giving out meal tickets through an online </span><a href=\"https://foodbank.as.ucsb.edu/swipes-for-us-application/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process, which can be used for pick-up meals at the Portola Dining Commons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic has put a strain on the community, Cohen maintains that the importance of food — now more than ever — is integral in keeping spirits high. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“More than food, these meals foster a moment of connection and seeing and being seen, and a reminder that everyone matters,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-13/in-a-time-of-crisis-local-food-based-services-step-up-to-the-plate/","id":4035,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[4034,4033,4032],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Half a Century Later, the Bank of America Fire Remains Burned Into I.V.’s Legacy With Help of KCSB Radio Documentary","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2020-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV_Unrest_BankOnFire_N.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV_Unrest_BankOnFire_N.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The hour-long special takes listeners on a dive into the KCSB archives, featuring news coverage of the Isla Vista riots.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sounds of the scene: tear gas rockets, outcries from the crowd and deputies breaking down apartment doors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KCSB-FM’s radio documentary “There, Where the Bank Burned,” which aired on Feb. 19, captured the chaos and confusion that ensued during several riots in the 1970 “Year of Rebellion,” including the burning of the Bank of America building in Isla Vista. The documentary was compiled as a mid-century reflection after the bank burned down 50 years ago on Feb. 25, 1970.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93125\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV_Unrest_BankOnFire_N-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2054792904\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93120\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93125\" class=\"wp-image-93125 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV_Unrest_BankOnFire_N-1-1024x710.jpg?resize=888%2C616\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"616\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93125\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1970, KCSB reporters covered the protests live in Isla Vista. </span><em>Courtesy of UCSB Library Special Collections</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1970, KCSB reporters covered the protests live in Isla Vista, providing listeners with the sights and sounds of the turmoil, until the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office forced the station to shut down for five days, according to Tim Owens, a former UC Santa Barbara student and the current general manager of KCSB. The police department claimed at the time that the radio station was preventing them from doing their jobs in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Owens explained, I.V.’s Bank of America at the time had become a symbol of the capitalist establishment, which many student activists attributed as the cause of oppressive social issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hour-long special takes listeners on a deep dive into the KCSB archives, featuring KCSB news coverage of the Isla Vista riots — often phoned in at the scene from telephone booths — the bank burning and recordings that depicted police violence against protestors, according to Lisa Osborn, current news director at KCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sound bites from key players like the Santa Barbara Police Department and then-defense attorney in the Chicago Seven trial William Kunstler, as well as accounts from former students, provide different perspectives on what happened and the consequences that followed. Sound bites of I.V. and narration from Owens illustrate the entirety of I.V. in 1970, later coined the “Year of Rebellion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For Isla Vista, 1970 was the scene of a bank burning, a fatal shooting with a student by a police office, novel law enforcement riot tactics, police brutality and mass arrests,” Owens said in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What came in February, April and June in Isla Vista spun its web around the symbol of the establishment: the Bank of America,” Owen said in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program takes a chronological approach, starting with the events that lead up to the Bank of America burning in February before taking listeners through the consequences that followed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A day before the Bank of America building burned, the special says the Santa Barbara Police arrested two men. According to the special, the warrants for their arrests cited their use of obscenities during an earlier protest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An argument ensued between the officers and the men, forming a crowd that quickly grew upset when the men were arrested. The crowd took action, desecrating the policeman’s car and eventually lighting it on fire. Another officer removed the police from the scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following day, and hours before the infamous bank burning, Kunstler had been scheduled to speak at the Harder stadium. The special included the audio from Kunstler’s speech at Harder Stadium, which focused on the frustrations of youth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In his book, Justice Douglas said the establishment today is the same as George the third. And he said if the establishment does not stop its stampede toward oppression and repression, then the only honorable course is what men did in 1776,” Kunstler said in his speech at Harder Stadium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owens explained how the timing of Kunstler’s speech, and the bank burning later that day, led the former state Attorney General to investigate Kunstler for inciting a riot. No evidence involving Kunstler was found, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when authorities showed up later that evening to control the crowds gathered on Embarcadero del Norte, they “proceeded to fire hundreds of rounds of tear gas at the demonstrators,” the special stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tensions climaxed at the Bank of America building, where Embarcadero Hall stands today. The bank was first looted and later set on fire — twice —  first around 7 p.m. when a dumpster was lit on fire and again around midnight when gasoline was used to rekindle the blaze, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, KCSB was broadcasting it all live. Owens extracted these clips from vintage KCSB archives to allow listeners to hear from the reporters who very first covered it, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pardall may be clear now, I’m not sure. I am beginning to feel the tear gas in my throat. I hear teargas rockets continuing to be fired off, which means they are coming from the overpass,” an unnamed KCSB reporter phoned in to the radio station.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the chaos ensued, KCSB student reporters described the riot’s atmosphere, preserving the sounds and images they witnessed from the streets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“An incendiary device has been thrown into the Bank of America right now, and it is burning very brightly on the floor with high flames shooting almost to the roof,” an anonymous KCSB reporter said. “However, again, you have your opposing factions in Isla Vista because almost as soon as that device was off inside the Bank of America, two guys went running through and attempted to stomp out the fire.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On April 18, a second riot occured at the bank. Violence ensued when it became known that the UCSB administration canceled a scheduled speech by a Chicago 7 defendant, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this riot, Santa Barbara police officer David Gosselin shot and killed 22-year-old UCSB student Kevin Moran, an economics major who was seeking to protect the bank from other student protestors. Gosselin, according to the special, claimed his rifle had misfired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemonium and confusion caused by the heavy exchange of gunfire during the first moments of conflict make it impossible at this time to accurately determine whether or not the officer fired the fatal projectile,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff James Webster said in a sound bite from a press conference featured in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the second protest, KCSB was ordered by Sheriff Webster to shut down its broadcasts; Webster stated at the time that KCSB’s broadcasting of the officer’s operations and locations were “making the enforcement of this area absolutely intolerable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Webster claimed he had the authority to shut down KCSB’s broadcasts despite dismissing questions about federal protections over the press, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They shut down KCSB — that’s very rare, because we’re licensed by the federal government, not the local cops, but because the Regents hold our license, supposedly, they wanted us off the air,” Osborn said, explaining how local police blamed KCSB for inciting violence at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KCSB returned to air five days later and continued to cover life in I.V., including having interviews with community residents who recounted the violence they witnessed.

However, the contract allowed HOPR to cancel at any time, as long as it gives the university 60-day notice, according to Chelsea Davidoff, a HOPR representative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main challenge was economic, ridership revenue is not enough to pay the bills. This is true for most transit modes,” Davidoff said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although HOPR’s ridership was not considered a problem, revenue from riders was not sufficient enough to cover operating costs, according to James Wagner, program manager for the Transportation Alternatives Program (T.A.P.) at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most bicycle-share programs on college campuses need subsidies to survive and keep their rates affordable to customers, due to the expensive cost of buying and maintaining shared bicycles, Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The HOPR contract contemplated securing a sponsor but since they didn’t get one, the program was not economically feasible. As such they requested to cancel the contract,” Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB T.A.P. plans to replace HOPR’s service with another bicycle rental company, </span><a href=\"https://www.bcycle.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BCycle</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the future, Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transportation &amp; Parking Services currently does not have room in its budget to front the cost for a bicycle-share program, Wagner said. HOPR did not initially ask for a subsidy because it expected to secure a sponsor, which is why it was contracted, Davidoff added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“HOPR provided an option to the University to sponsor or subsidize the program as part of the transportation budget, but this budget was not available,” Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We may open another request for proposals (RFP) to see if other bicycle share vendors are willing to provide bicycle share at no cost to the university besides user fees,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recognized as a Platinum-level Bicycle Friendly University by the League of American Bicyclists</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Part of this recognition is due to the large number of bicycles available to share on campus through HOPR, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOPR remains in other cities and universities throughout the country where it has found more economic success, such as UC Los Angeles, the University of South Florida and the cities of Santa Monica, Atlanta and Orlando, according to Davidoff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidoff said that despite the early contract termination, HOPR leaves UCSB thankful for the opportunity from the university and support from students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope they find a budget for bike share, students love it, it is affordable, healthy, fun and environmentally friendly. If there is a will, there’s always a way,” Davidoff said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92765\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/hopping-off-hopr-bike-program-decides-to-leave-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92765\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/hopping-off-hopr-bike-program-decides-to-leave-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/hopping-off-hopr-bike-program-decides-to-leave-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/hopping-off-hopr-bike-program-decides-to-leave-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/hopping-off-hopr-bike-program-decides-to-leave-campus/","id":3389,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[3388,3387,3386],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s First Mental Town Hall Focuses on Accessibility, Community Engagement","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UCENSurfJohnClow.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UCENSurfJohnClow.jpeg?resize=980%2C567&ssl=1","description":"The town hall was organized by the A.S.

Office of the President and UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force, aimed to address student needs through an open discussion facilitated by university administration and mental health specialists, followed by a Q&amp;A portion and discussion groups. The event concluded with a brief tour of campus resources at different tables. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With this structure for the town hall, we hope to provide a forum where members of the UCSB community can easily and safely voice their concerns and be a valuable part of the process to improve our campus climate on mental health,” Sejal Anuraji, mental health coordinator for the A.S. Office of the President, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current climate and stigma around mental health at UCSB was examined in detail to help service providers understand where they needed to fill in the gaps, according to A.S. President Alison Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students argued at the town hall that UCSB should be focused on making mental health services more visible to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mental health affects students’ everyday lives … from academic success to relationships to self-care and I hope to see more advertisement of the resources available,” Anna Talamantes, a fourth-year biopsychology major, said in a discussion group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A variety of UCSB mental health services were represented at the town hall, including  leadership and mental health professionals from Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force, members of the A.S. Office of the President and other university administration members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharleen O’Brien, director of the Mental Health Task Force, said the event was organized with the intention of introducing the student body to the task force and making them aware of its role on campus. O’Brien described the Mental Health Task Force as centered around three main goals: mobilizing additional campus resources, increasing visibility and accessibility of services and gaining feedback from students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mental Health Task Force was introduced by O’Brien as a new coalition for change, at the beginning of the event. O’Brien further identified members of the task force in the room and explained their purpose.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Mental Health Task Force was constituted to work on better coordination among campus services and to develop enhanced communication that makes it more clear to students, faculty and staff how to access services and what resources are provided through each department,” Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, said at the town hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the “fishbowl” discussion portion among several UCSB staff members and students, they highlighted key obstacles and discussed where these issues stem from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wait times for C.A.P.S. services are one of the biggest obstacles for students to receive care, according to Brian Olowude, director of C.A.P.S. Students are often discouraged by the waiting period between appointments, and there is currently a struggle to determine the best way to solve this issue without compromising quality care, Olowude said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude added it has also been a challenge to learn how to effectively educate students about other campus mental health services besides C.A.P.S. — such as C.A.R.E and the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program — that may better fit their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several campus organizations also had the opportunity to table at the event and answer attendees’ questions. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E.) was one such organization, which sought to increase its visibility and presence in the mental health conversation at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many survivors don’t know that C.A.R.E. is not just about advocacy — it’s also very much focused on overall student mental health and well-being,” Shalmali Patil, a C.A.R.E peer educator and third-year psychological and brain sciences and statistics and data science double major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students also discussed intersectionality in relation to mental health, voicing concerns about finding resources that are accessible to their unique communities and people who understand the particular issues they might encounter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are often certain obstacles and challenges faced uniquely by minority communities. I also hope to see a more accessible and clear directory showing which resources are available to students for a variety of different issues,” Sir said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The climate crisis was another growing area of concern that can impact mental well-being, Julia Fine, a doctoral student in linguistics, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our studies indicate that high levels of concern, anxiety, anger and grief are all connected to the climate crisis … [so we are] interested in how we can use the resources on campus to support student climate activists,” Fine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said a follow-up to the town hall is scheduled to take place sometime in the near future and said that she hopes that the follow-up will help establish tangible change to campus resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope this can be an ongoing event for years to come so that we can continue to provide a platform for the community to give their input and conduct a friendly check-in on the state of UCSB’s student resources.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [2/07/2020, 3:55 p.m.]: A previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Shalmali Patil is a third-year psychological and brain science major. She is a C.A.R.E. peer educator who is double majoring in psychological and brain science and statistics and data science. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92658\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92658\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/","id":3385,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[3384,3383,3382],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

This set number of swipes expires at the end of each week and cannot be used for the weeks following. In Ferguson and Mitchell’s resolution, the two argue that meal swipes should expire at the end of each quarter, rather than each week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal, as detailed in the resolution, would allow meal swipes to be used throughout the quarter rather than expire each Sunday after dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In order to make full use of student meal plans, there needs to be amendments to how meal plan swipes can be used, by whom, and when they expire,” the resolution reads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states that students with 17 meal swipes per week or fewer should be able to swipe guests into the dining commons with their own meal swipes, rather than be charged a $12 fee for each guest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the UCSB Housing </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/dining/offcampus-mealplan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a standard 14 meals per week costs $1,532 per quarter. Students who choose to live in the dorms are mandated to buy a meal plan, the cost of which is added in with their housing expenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a lower-income, first-generation, queer college student, I understand the struggles of not knowing when your next meal may come sometimes. I couldn’t afford a meal plan this year because of how expensive they are,” Ferguson said in Wednesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution supports several other modifications to the current meal plan rules, namely removing the cap on how many meals students may donate to the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank each week, which is currently at a maximum of three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the resolution, the A.S. Food Bank had already been working with Executive Director of Campus Dining Jill Horst to try to implement a policy to allow students to donate more of their meal swipes per week, according to Eric Nava, the Food Bank’s student coordinator and fourth-year religious studies major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been working with Jill to try to raise this cap for about three years now and the process has been very stagnant,” Nava said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nava said the A.S. Food Bank staff supports the resolution and is hopeful that the added support of the Senate position can help them meet their goals in raising or abolishing the current donation cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The issue isn’t just about accessibility, but also about waste, specifically a waste of money. When something is paid for, it should remain in the system and be reused for students who need those swipes,” said Soha Sadeghinejad, the student sponsor of the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this isn’t the first time meal rollovers have been discussed. Ferguson referred to similar demands made in 2006, when a survey showing support for meal rollover was presented to the UCSB Dining Services director, the Housing &amp; Residential Services executive director and the Residential Housing Association president, citing a previous </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2006-04-04/survey-results-heat-up-debate-over-possible-meal-rollover-system/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> article.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In 2006, On-Campus Senator Nathaniel Wood-Wilde presented a survey to RHA showing that a majority of students supported a meal swipe rollover policy. The RHA were ‘considering the implementation of rollovers in student meal plans’ and were ‘definitely interested to see what works best for students,’” Ferguson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Food insecurity is no joke; it’s a big issue on college campuses, and this resolution is another step in the right direction. Students desperately want change, and through advocacy and support we can make that change a reality,” Sadeghinejad said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 28, 5:23 p.m.] </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/","id":3368,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[3367,3366,3365],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How Isla Vista Businesses Survive the Long Winter","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2020-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Running an Isla Vista storefront is not all lattes and catchy names — businesses can be forced to hibernate for long stretches at a time when UC Santa Barbara is not in session.

But winter break brings a decrease in customers, and despite the density in population, college students can turn out to be a much more difficult demographic to break into,  Yamasaki explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Yamasaki, this is because students often have limited resources and have a higher standard for what they are willing to spend money on and the value they are getting. Businesses struggle to meet this standard at a price that pays the bills, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high cost of living also makes it hard for businesses to have sufficient time to establish the roots they need to develop a following, especially for smaller businesses, according to Darien Nisbett, marketing representative at Woodstock’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would imagine it is difficult to generate the sales necessary to pay your employees a living wage and eliminate turnover in that sense as well,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, winter break brings the challenge of finding people to work; UCSB or Santa Barbara Community College students make up the majority of employees — Nisbett said students make up 90% of employees at Woodstock’s, which means they often go home for breaks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closing the store can bring more benefits than keeping it open; maintaining a healthy store is not simply about cash flow but also maintaining an enjoyable and inviting atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take this time to update the restaurant … [We] see an increase in business in-store from families in the surrounding areas and businesses in Goleta, as well as deliveries,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have found that in recent years, the gamble to stay open has proved to be more and more successful. Yamasaki said he has noticed an increasing number of students who choose to stay over break. And as these businesses have developed a more consistent customer base, they can rely on some of these students to still support the store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We stayed open almost the whole break and we gained some understanding that many </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international and out-of-state students are still here. They appreciate having some place to hang out and eat,” Wang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides winter break, summer also proves challenging to businesses, which often find profits to be cut in half for three months out of the year.

It calls on the UC to end the use of all Proposition 65 herbicide on the campus, and asks the university to “notify students, faculty, and staff before any synthetic herbicides are sprayed at UCSB and in surrounding areas, including location and time details.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution many of the synthetic herbicides used by the UC </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as glyphosate, oryzalin and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are considered by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer to be probable carcinogens, meaning long-term exposure to such chemicals could be detrimental to human health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states there have been a considerable number of court cases in California ruled that glyphosate-based herbicides had caused cancer, referencing one where, in August 2018, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco Superior Court jury in the Dewayne Johnson v. Monsanto case found that glyphosate-based herbicide exposure was responsible for the plaintiff’s terminal cancer. Johnson was awarded $79 million. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The San Francisco Federal Court also ruled exposure to these same synthetic chemicals were the probable cause of cancer in another plaintiff, Hardeman, awarding him $80 million, according to the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This short-sighted outlook, on minimizing acute toxicity for maximum weed control, leaves our groundskeepers, communities and environments vulnerable to the long term impacts,” Sheina Crystal, student sponsor of the resolution, said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC system should prioritize the health and safety of land managers, students, faculty and community members over campus aesthetics and band aid treatments.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A similar resolution was previously brought to the table at last year’s 69th Senate and also passed, but ultimately expired after the 70th senate took office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Regents did temporarily suspend the use of glyphosate on all UC campuses, which came into effect in June 2019, with several exceptions, citing “concerns about possible human health and ecological hazards, as well as potential legal and reputational risks associated with this category of herbicides,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/july19/c4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of the President</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Various universities across the nation have already taken steps toward reducing and eliminating harmful herbicides on their campuses. The list stated in the resolution includes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Colorado at Boulder, University of Arizona, Yale and the University of Michigan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concerns of the effects from these types of synthetic herbicides were first introduced to the UC in 2017 through the movement </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herbicide-Free Cal, which effectively ended herbicide use on a number of spaces on the UC Berkeley campus, including its two largest green areas, according to the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A timeline for the proposed ban of these herbicides has not yet been established, but the resolution “asks that all responsible parties work diligently to ensure that the severity of the issue is addressed.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Rankin/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Rifkin, a program coordinator at the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), said over email that the program is designed to help international students find their way around UCSB, “creating opportunities for both international and domestic students and staff to build friendships, share cultures, and developing critical 21st century cross-cultural communication skills in a welcoming and supportive small-group setting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OISS staff anticipates roughly 133 mentors and mentees in total for this fall quarter. The office plans to put on events throughout the year for mentorship pairings, but the goal for the program is for the pairs to find and share commonalities in their free time as well, Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes a great deal of courage to leave your family and friends behind to pursue their academic aspirations,” Rifkin said. “The Global Ambassador Program tries to ensure that our international students feel welcome and included.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mission of OISS is to “cultivate an inclusive environment which supports international students academically, professionally and personally by providing holistic advising on immigration, employment and cultural matters</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” according to its website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff and advisors at OISS recognize that international students often have difficulty making friends and can feel uncomfortable sharing their culture, Rifkin said, and added that similar programs have found success at universities like UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunity to mentor also gives experienced UCSB students the opportunity to gain important skills in an increasingly global world, Rifkin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This holds true with Lauren McKnight, a third-year biochemistry major who was a tour guide for international students over the summer who said she wanted to continue cultivating those relationships during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having grown up in southern California, I’ve always been really familiar with the culture in California and the U.S. By getting to know my mentees and other international students, I get to see a little bit more of their perspective of the environment here,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McKnight added that the Global Ambassador Program not only creates an easier transition for international students but overall increases campus diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Joost, a global ambassador and fourth-year global studies major, said she has cultivated friendships that extend beyond the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also have a great line of communication through [Snapchat] and WhatsApp. We try to meet [up] just to study, or if one of us is just hanging out in IV we try to let the group know that they can join us!” Joost said over email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am hoping to build some great friendships and to learn more about the different cultures within my group,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another mentor, Jordan Kaiser, fourth-year global studies major, said she understood the difficulty of trying to cross a cultural barrier from her time studying abroad in Berlin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wished I had a program like this when I was abroad. I often felt confused or lost when I was abroad and had a hard time breaking out of my ‘American bubble,’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Rifkin, the program not only benefits international students but also the ambassadors who learn to view the world through a “different cultural lens,” particularly those interested in working in an international field or studying abroad.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As international educators we recognize that global exchange is a two-way street,” Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s domestic students and staff stand to learn just as much as from our international students and scholars as they do from joining our campus community.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90627\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90627\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/","id":1955,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[1954,1953,1952],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Research Recruitment App To Launch at UCSB This Fall","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Psychology-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Psychology-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Not only will Ugig benefit UCSB researchers, but it can grant students an opportunity to find, participate and profit from studies on a straightforward platform.

Firestone and Akuamoah-Boateng pitched Ugig to a group of other students at the competition, where they met fourth-year political science major Cole Parker, who now acts as the marketing section of their team, and UCSB alumnus Justin Hemphill, who later joined the team to focus on software development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project earned third place and $5,000 to continue developing the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two co-founders were also invited to continue development of the application through the UCSB Office of Research at the Mosher Alumni House and plan to launch a beta version in the fall with both a web and mobile interface, Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are extremely grateful for the Office of Research at UCSB. They have been really gracious and willing to work with and believe in us. We could not think of a better university to start a company at,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair chose the name “Ugig” for several reasons; the ‘u’ represents both the university and the individual by providing a platform for people to profit from sharing personal data. The ‘gig’ part of the name refers to a job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Firestone’s experience as a researcher over the summer, the majority of his time was spent recruiting people for their research studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Opportunities are not widely available for the general public to know about or participate in. So that’s really the first problem that we are trying to address with our app,” Firestone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only will Ugig benefit UCSB researchers, but it can grant students an opportunity to find, participate and profit from studies on a straightforward platform, according to Hemphill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parker said that the university system for getting participants is flawed in its effectiveness, but also tarnishes the quality of research produced. The main method for participation is through unpaid course credit completed by students who are often taking multiple classes in that field, which is not representative of the general population, Akuamoah-Boateng explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After interviewing professors and researchers at multiple universities, the Ugig team found it was a common issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In a university setting, recruitment is really decentralized, and they are often recruiting primarily from their own department, but they are running studies meant to assess the general population. So our platform is meant to get anyone who wants to contribute to research in the local area,” Parker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugig is unique in that it is the first company focused on recruiting sample sizes that better represent the general population, Firestone said. While many departments at UCSB already utilize software for managing research studies, namely Sona Systems, the team has heard from various professors that recruitment is still a challenge, especially outside of each department, according to Firestone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sona does also connect [researchers and participants]. The problem you see with Sona is that they’re not actually actively recruiting. For us, we think it is important to involve and market to the student body, the research that takes place at UCSB,” Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In reality, we are changing the model, and while disrupting the current technology, are working in such an underserved space,” Firestone said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugig will be starting small with beta testing before releasing it to the public. The team has the goal of getting almost every study at UCSB on their interface by the beginning of the 2020-21 academic year, Hemphill said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe this app has greater implications for research as a whole. Our mission goes past the university scale,” Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89941\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89941\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/research-recruitment-app-to-launch-at-ucsb-this-fall/","id":3292,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[3291,3290,3289],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/20"}},"__N_SSG":true}
