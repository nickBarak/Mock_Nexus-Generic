Food Co-op and Santa Barbara Student Housing Co-op, Associated Students and Isla Vista community members.<em> Alexander Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Food Bank and UCSB Sustainability hosted their first of two Isla Vista Food Forums discussing student food insecurity at the local and state level at the Santa Barbara Hillel last night.</p>\n<p>During the forum attendees explored student inaccessibility to healthy food, the lack of local governance surrounding healthy eating practices, the increasing costs of education and its impact on student health and the financial issues that accompany eating out versus grocery shopping. The idea for the forum was born from collaboration between the A.S. Food Bank Committee and UC President Janet Napolitano’s UC Global Food Initiative, which aims to establish food security around the world.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank Chair Katie Freeze said planning for the forums manifested after the California Higher Education Food Summit, which brought sustainability workshops and renowned sustainable food advocates to campus this past January.</p>\n<p>“Our hope is to continue the conversation surrounding food justice and food security that grew out of the California Higher Education Food Summit, but to bring the discussion back to a more local level that students and I.V. community members can really relate to and be a part of,” Freeze said in an email.</p>\n<p>Freeze said goals for the forum include bringing students, I.V. residents and local organizations together to come up with solutions for the various food security issues that surround students on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Through the forum, we are hoping to create and implement feasible methods for ensuring that all I.V. residents have access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food in the future,” Freeze said in an email. “The more voices we can involve, the more successful we will be in achieving this goal.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeze, food inaccessibility is a problem of increasing severity, with the A.S. Food Bank servicing over 4,000 individuals since opening in 2011.</p>\n<p>“We feel it’s really important for students to be involved in the forum because food insecurity remains largely unacknowledged in our community,” Freeze said in an email. “It is a major problem that is continuing to grow, especially among students.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Sustainability Coordinator Katie Maynard said input from the campus community is an important aspect of these forums when discussing methods to improve health and food security on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to get feedback from students, staff, and faculty across campus on what we should include in our goals moving forward,” Maynard said in an email. “As a result we will be hosting a series of public forums this quarter and next.”</p>\n<p>General Manager of the Isla Vista Food Co-op Melissa Cohen said the purpose of the forums is to begin uniting various food-centered dialogue  occurring in the I.V. community, including work done by the A.S. Food Bank and in light of the UC Global Food Initiative.</p>\n<p>“The goal is to start to thread together a lot of different conversations that are happening to create one cohesive dialogue and to then be utilized in future conversations,” Cohen said. “The Food Forum will show that there’s a unified dialogue happening between everyone who’s in an invested organization in this conversation.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said the I.V. Food Co-op is a major partner of the A.S. Food Bank and works closely with them on issues surrounding “the food movement” in I.V.<br>\n“The goal is to make sure that everyone who needs to be in this dialogue and who is affected by either food insecurity or are affected by being a part of an organization that has the resources to address that … are talking to each other,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Diane Fox, who ran a food co-op 30 years ago in New Haven, Connecticut, said the forum brought back memories of the struggles she and community members faced in terms of food security and affordability in her own community.</p>\n<p>“This is sort of nostalgic for me because I ran a food co-op, so I’m interested in the issues that people are struggling with because I remember those issues,” Fox said. “I love the energy that people are bringing. It’s made me want to come visit the co-op here.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Environmental Affairs Board member and second year psychology major Yanira Flores said the I.V. Food Forum is a great way to create a dialogue between students and organizations to figure out how to better serve the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really good resource to have because it’s a very good way to start a conversation that’s been pending for a very long time,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>“Although the Environmental Board is mainly environmental, it has to do with every aspect of environmentalism which includes food security and food justice. It’s all incorporated and inter-connected.”</p>\n<p>Flores also said the most important issue I.V. and the university need to work on is educating both students and citizens on food resources available to them.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like a few of the things people were saying they needed are already in place but they just weren’t aware that it was,” Flores said. “So I think information, education and more communication between businesses, between students and between Isla Vista itself [is important].”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, March 5, 2015 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A more permanent solution—of wood fences up to four-and-a-half feet tall—will be supported by $70,000 from UCSB, the university announced Tuesday. <em>Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB announced Tuesday that it will provide $70,000 to Santa Barbara County for the construction of permanent fences along the bluffs in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The university said it will cover the entire estimated cost for the installation of the fences and has agreed that if the project comes in under budget, the remaining funds will be used by the county for maintaining the fence. The fences will run from the end of Del Playa Open Space Park to Walter Capps Park and will include all parks owned by the county and the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD). Once the fence is completed, the county will assume responsibility for future maintenance and repairs.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s involvement in the fencing project since the death of multiple students from <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/cliff-fall-victim-paralyzed-from-waist-down/\">cliff falls</a> in 2013 has largely contributed to the university’s decision to provide funding to the county.</p>\n<p>“Chancellor Yang has been deeply involved in this project since the beginning, when Molly Morrison founded Fence Isla Vista, and since we lost students to cliff-related deaths and injuries,” Schunk said. “Yang has taken a very active and involved role in this entire effort so I think part of it was him pushing it and making it a top priority.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biological sciences major and Fence I.V. founder Molly Morrison said she founded her organization, which aims to improve current fencing standards along the cliffs on Del Playa Drive, after her friend and <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/woman-found-on-isla-vista-beach-identified-as-cal-poly-slo-student/\">Cal Poly SLO student Giselle Ayala</a>, along with three other students, died after falling from the cliffs since April 2013.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s extremely vital to make these occurrences as preventable as possible,” Morrison said. “I do believe the personal responsibility is also an extremely vital aspect in these scenarios, but there is work to be done on both ends to help end these tragedies.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said she believes the university decided to fund the project due to Santa Barbara county’s historical lack of funding to improve fencing along the I.V. cliffs.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that they have been inactive, but that it has taken so long to find a source of funding that should normally be very fast, as fencing is one of the largest safety concerns in Santa Barbara area,” Morrison said. “[UCSB’s contribution] is extremely helpful, as it is funding the entire project. I am so grateful for the generous donors who have dedicated their resources to help make this place safer.”</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD general manager Rodney Gould, the university’s contribution to the project is critical to its timely completion because the project was not a budgeted expense for the district and therefore was difficult to fund. Gould said construction should begin shortly given the end of the permitting process.</p>\n<p>“I know the funding has been received by the County and they are in discussions with a contractor,” Gould said in an email. “My best guess, and it is only a guess, is that construction will begin in the next few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the fences installed along the bluffs will be three-ring wood fences up to 54 inches high with diamond-shaped, nylon-coated chain links to prevent someone from being able to climb over the fence.</p>\n<p>“The idea for the small diamonds is so you can’t fit your hands or toes into it easily and climb over it,” Schunk said. “The thing to keep in mind is we aren’t going for a high security fence because we’re looking at prevention.”</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said the university and the county have been working on installing I.V. bluff fencing since last Fall and that the recent funding will finally ensure the project’s completion.</p>\n<p>“I asked the chancellor last October in a letter to fund a couple of county projects, starting with the bluff fencing, and the county said that we would do the maintenance once it was installed,” Farr said. “It’s on our agenda for next week so I’m really happy to see that it’s finally coming together.”</p>\n<p>Farr also said the county wants to make open park spaces on DP as safe as possible in light historical cliff falls resulting in the death of multiple students since 2005.</p>\n<p>“We warn people about the danger of the bluffs and although there have always been some kind of a fence up there to deter people, they either obey the signs or go around the fencing and walk on the other side,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, many individuals do not take into account that the cliffs’ eroding nature make their edges particularly dangerous for people treading the Del Playa bluffs.</p>\n<p>“People also need to understand that the geologic material of those bluffs are very erosive so they’re constantly crumbling away. I think that’s another reason why people might make the mistake sometimes and think there’s more property on the other side of the fence than there really is,” Farr said. “So we’re constantly monitoring it from a public safety standpoint from the beach side as well as from the upper side.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while the university’s contribution is helpful, he hopes it is more than a one-time effort to improve safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I hope this influx of funds towards I.V. and level of attention is not temporary because of the events last spring, but history tells us it is,” Abboud said in an email. “I’m optimistic that this time around we can come up with a long term solution that keeps everyone involved and helping better Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Cameron Schunk stating a preference for a high security fence. Schunk actually said the fence were for prevention, not high security purposes.

Students and faculty also talked about the presence of undocumented students on campus and the positive influence immigrants have had on Santa Barbara’s economy.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sociology professor William Robinson said Obama has been known as the deportation president to many undocumented individuals, with more deportations occurring under his administration than any other, according to Robinson.</p>\n<p>“On the one hand he’s talking about the rights of immigrants and he’s giving temporary residency to some immigrants that meet certain conditions,” Robinson said. “Yet on the other hand, he’s deported more immigrants than any other president in about fifty to sixty years.”</p>\n<p>Robinson said immigrants to the U.S. have become the “scapegoat” for the multitude of financial and economic problems the country is currently facing, all of which are reflected in Obama’s immigration policies.</p>\n<p>“First, it’s generating a great humanitarian crisis for 12 million immigrants in the country and their families, and second, immigrants play an absolutely crucial role in sustaining the U.S., and for that matter the global economy,” Robinson said. “Third, these mass deportations without the due process is violation of international law.”</p>\n<p>According to Robinson, in order to fix what he calls the mass deportation issue in the U.S., the government must enforce a suspension on all raids and deportations of undocumented citizens. He also said undocumented individuals should have full labor, civil and political rights including automatic residency to undocumented citizens that have no record of criminal activity in the form of an easier pathway to citizenship than current exists.</p>\n<p>“This notion that you can divide the global population to citizen and immigrant is an outdated notion and one that is creating a new access of inequality worldwide,” Robinson said, “Inequality between citizens who have all these rights and immigrants who don’t have any of those rights.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them. – MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau</p></blockquote>\n<p>Robinson said it is vital that students understand issues surrounding mass deportation as urgent social and political issues that directly affect students and faculty at the university.</p>\n<p>“We have both documented and undocumented immigrants right here on campus, so they should be sensitive and aware of this issue and what’s at stake,” Robinson said.</p>\n<p>During the discussion Golash-Boza cited the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 as a starting point of racialized immigration policy in the U.S. and said that, fast-forwarding to the present day, even without a specific law stating that deportation is exclusive to a certain ethnic group, evidence shows that a majority of recent U.S. deportations have been of individuals of Latino descent.</p>\n<p>“Even though [the government] can’t directly create a law that says, ‘We aren’t going to target Latinos,’ it’s still able to happen,” Golash-Boza said. “The racial contours of immigration policy have changed, but it’s still constant.”</p>\n<p>MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau said part of the MCC’s mission is to bring attention to issues involving underrepresented populations in America.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing our part here in our community by bringing in speakers to address these hard issues,” Thibdeau said. “Mass deportation is a very sensitive topic that can be very political, but we aren’t afraid of those type of topics.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out. – Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thibdeau also said the MCC wanted to make sure students are informed of the impact governmental policies can have on the nation.</p>\n<p>“We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them,” Thibdeau said. “There may be students here that aren’t citizens for example, or maybe their parents aren’t, so it’s a very important issue to make sure we’re all aware of.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar said Golash-Boza’s discussion did a great job of explaining the essential role global capitalism has on minorities, although she also excluded some specific details.</p>\n<p>“I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out,” Salazar said. “For example, the Undocumented Youth Movement and different groups who have passed a lot of laws like the Trust Act and the new law AB60.”</p>\n<p>According to Salazar, students need to become more aware of the presence of undocumented students on campus as well as of the vital role the Santa Barbara immigrant community plays in supporting the local economy.</p>\n<p>“Whether [the students] are invested in the <em>News-Press</em> or other types of institutions, its foundation is immigrant community but at the same time its racism against the immigrant community,” Salazar said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Matthew Avalos said the discussion touched on his personal experiences as well as on the history of deportation he has learned from his classes at the university.</p>\n<p>“I am Hispanic myself and I have a lot of Hispanic friends, so I’ve heard stories of parents of friends who thought they could get deported,” Avalos said. “I just didn’t know that it had blown up to this extent and turned into such a massive problem.”</p><div

visitors, who flock to Isla Vista by the thousands annually for Deltopia (above), from parking in local communities. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The Goleta City Council decided to consider a plan on Tuesday to use parking permits to discourage out-of-town visitors from flooding Isla Vista during Deltopia this April, a method used in October to limit crowds during Halloween.</p>\n<p>Under the plan, parking permits for certain areas of the City of Goleta will be issued by mail and posted in the windows of residents’ cars during the weekend of Deltopia, taking place this year on April 4. The annual event typically attracts thousands of out-of-town visitors, whose presence creates parking issues for portions of the city over the weekend. The parking permits would be issued for neighborhoods south of Hollister Avenue between Cannon Green Drive and Storke Road to the city limits, the same area issued parking permits for Halloween.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Rob Plastino, Goleta City Council saw the damage and destruction caused by Deltopia last spring and is aiming to put preventative measures in place to keep I.V. safe.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how inconvenienced we or the residents of Isla Vista are, it all boils down to if everyone got home safe,” Plastino said. “That’s my number one concern is that you guys are safe.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said one of Goleta’s concern about Deltopia is the number of attendees expected to show up and how the city will protect its residents from the influx.</p>\n<p>“As a city, they are definitely concerned with an influx of outsiders flooding the city streets and potentially parking in front of people’s houses and now the people that live in those houses don’t have parking spaces,” Plastino said. “They’re looking at it as a city that needs to protect its residents, and it’s a good idea for them to do that because it would help us keep the outsiders to a minimum during Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said the parking permits would help deter outsiders from the event if available parking is minimal, and a decrease in visitors could mean less injuries and damage to I.V. and its residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s a concern of mine because my job is to make sure the public of Isla Vista is safe, and that means anyone in Isla Vista, whether that is outsiders or locals,” Plastino said. “I have to make sure that the property of residents remains as safe as possible too.”</p>\n<p>According to Goleta City Council Public Information Officer Valerie Kushnerov, an issue with permitting over Halloween was lack of adequate permits available per resident. Kushnerov said permits would be mailed out to an entire apartment complex rather than each unit, which left multiple residents without protection offered by the permits.</p>\n<p>Kushnerov said the city had undertaken preliminary research and action to ensure more residents receive permits in the event of restrictions.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already researched the area and updated our lists, so that the lists we give to the mail house will be more accurate next time,” Kushnerov said. “There will be additional costs because there’s more postage required to send out more permits, but those costs are minimal.”</p>\n<p>Kushnerov said although the rain could have been a major factor in Halloween’s low attendance, the council believes the permits could be very beneficial, especially with the citizens approval during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“Last year was an interesting year in terms of Halloween because of the rain, so we don’t have a great picture of what impact the parking permits played,” Kushnerov said. “What we do know is that our residents were very happy that the city put in place a program to help minimize impacts to their neighborhoods during Halloween and have asked the city council to continue the program for future events.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College fourth-year psychology major and I.V. resident Austin Thomas said parking is a major problem in I.V. even when there is no event on the weekend.</p>\n<p>“The streets near my house are always crowded, so at times it can be hard for me to find parking by my own house,” Thomas said. “It can get really frustrating because those people might not even be residents, but out-of-towners here for the weekend.”</p>\n<p>Thomas said he thought the use of parking permits would ensure that residents have guaranteed parking during Deltopia and will allow them to enjoy the festivities without worry.</p>\n<p>“I would feel better for the safety of my car and my house if I knew it was just residents parking in our neighborhoods,” Thomas said. “It would be a lot easier to enjoy Deltopia with that peace of mind.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60065\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/goleta-contemplates-parking-permits-for-deltopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60065\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/goleta-contemplates-parking-permits-for-deltopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/goleta-contemplates-parking-permits-for-deltopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/goleta-contemplates-parking-permits-for-deltopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/goleta-contemplates-parking-permits-for-deltopia/","id":4775,"author":{"id":167,"name":"Erica Loera"},"related":[4774,4773,4772],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sick as a Dog: Parvovirus on the Rise in Santa Maria","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Santa Barbara County Animal Services has reported a high number of cases of parvovirus in dogs in the Santa Maria area, with five confirmed cases in the last few weeks.

\r\n</script> \n<p>According to Courtney Hazard, a technician at Valley Animal Hospital in Goleta, parvovirus has been a problem for a long time because of its level of contagiousness.</p>\n<p>“Dogs can basically sniff the ground where another dog walked or peed and become infected,” Hazard said. “It can hit pretty hard and fast, and if they aren’t treated it can become fatal very quickly.”</p>\n<p>Hazard said treatment for parvovirus can be pretty tedious as the dogs have to combat both the viral and bacterial component.</p>\n<p>“They have to be quarantined, have an I.V. catheter placed, be put on fluids and given injectable antibiotics instead of oral medicine so their liver doesn’t have to process anything,” Hazard said. “Their body has to fight off the viral side because we don’t have a treatment for that unfortunately.”</p>\n<p>Santa Maria Animal Care Foundation volunteer coordinator Stacy Silva said the organization’s greatest concern has been regarding owners of confirmed infected puppies refusing treatment and taking the sick dogs home from veterinary offices.</p>\n<p>“Right now we are seeing this in the Santa Maria area with several cases in the last few weeks, which is a pretty high number,” Silva said.</p>\n<p>According to Silva, signs of the parvovirus show up within 10 to 14 days, depending on the level of exposure the dog has had.</p>\n<p>“The virus spreads very rapidly through contact with surfaces of an infected dog or even the infected dog itself,” Silva said. “The virus itself can be killed with a bleach and water solution, however, it can live in porous surfaces for up to two years in the right condition.”</p>\n<p>Hazard said the most important step in avoiding the parvovirus is to fully vaccinate dogs, a process that takes 16 weeks to complete.</p>\n<p>“We tell owners all the time to not take your unvaccinated puppy to the dog park, the beach or sniff anything too much and to keep them on the cement if you have to take them for a walk.” Hazard said. “Keep your dog as close to your home as you can and don’t let them be in contact with any other dog until they’re fully vaccinated.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biology and English double-major Andy Hashimoto, who worked at an animal clinic in Monterey, CA, said once a dog is infected it is difficult to get rid of the virus.</p>\n<p>“There was a parvo-puppy at the clinic I worked at and he was quarantined so no one was allowed in there unless they wore a big white suit,” Hashimoto said. “It was really sad because we had to wear gloves if we wanted to feed him or pet him.”</p>\n<p>According to Hashimoto, it’s easy to protect a dog from the virus if they are given the vaccinations they need when they are puppies.</p>\n<p>“The parvo vaccine is usually included in the first vaccine pack you have to get for your puppy, so just make sure you get that because it’s very important before they’re too old,” Hashimoto said. “It’s a really easy thing to do and it could save a dog’s life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
