Several students approached the podium during the public forum and argued that the council ignored the student body’s interests.</p>\n<p>Additionally, one speaker placed responsibility for the council’s decision on Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker due to her tie-breaking vote. Although Stryker said she supports the SOCC, she does not believe A.S.’s special projects budget should finance the conference.</p>\n<p>Stryker said she offered to dedicate $600 from her office’s funds toward the conference but did not receive a request from the group until Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter said the council’s debate focused on the appropriateness of using the special projects budget rather than the SOCC’s goals.</p>\n<p>Walter asked student attendees for input to help prove the council’s support after hearing numerous speakers.</p>\n<p>“Would you like it if we make a public statement of support, perhaps published in the Nexus — hopefully, if the Nexus will run it — would that make be a sufficient show of support?” Walter said.</p>\n<p>However, SOCC speakers said a public statement would only serve as an appeasement.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Sophia Armen, who chose to address the council as a student body member, said the student government’s endorsement for such events is vital for the campus community.</p>\n<p>“Support folks that do good shit! Students of color are disproportionately marginalized [and] they have to go through so much every day,” Armen said. “Being in this room, sitting at this table is a privilege. You are no longer acting for yourself; you are acting in consideration of other people … The climate of this room is not progressing us towards making this a more inclusive association.”</p>\n<p>In light of the council’s $145 Oct. 27 allocation toward the Campus Democrats, A.S. President Harrison Weber said the issue provokes a larger discussion on the council budget’s intended use.</p>\n<p>“The council needs to define what [its] special projects [budget] is for,” Weber said. “It sends a mixed message that the role of special projects isn’t to fund groups, but another group was funded. Also, I think it speaks to the larger issue: we need to have more discussion outside of this council.”</p>\n<p>The council had yet to discuss the bills and resolutions on last night’s agenda including legislation to restructure the External Vice President of Local Affairs, IVP and CAB Foundation offices as of press time.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/","id":3097,"author":{"id":202,"name":"Yishian Yao"},"related":[3096,3095,3094],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Prospective Presidents Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students held its second and final open forum for presidential candidates yesterday in the Hub.

Voting will be accessible through GOLD from April 18 at 8 a.m. until April 21 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Open People’s Party candidate Harrison Weber, a third-year history of public policy major and current Student Advocate General, said he would promote transparency and student outreach within the association.</p>\n<p>“Most students have no clue about what A.S. is doing on campus or where their funds are going,” Weber said. “We need to streamline the information being sent out to our student population and provide a monthly or weekly report about where those fees are going.”</p>\n<p>Weber said he would also seek to confront a recent trend of student apathy.</p>\n<p>“There are significantly more people at the undie run every quarter than at the budget rallies and protests,” Weber said. “Gaucho spirit does exist, we just need to channel it so we can tackle big issues, like the budget cuts.”</p>\n<p>Democratic Process Party candidate Stanley Tzankov, a third-year political science major and current off-campus representative, said he would work to implement the “core four” ideas at the heart of DPP’s plans for A.S.</p>\n<p>“I will create solutions that make the most of our resources, utilize the Office of the President to organize projects and programs to reach out to our students, work on student retention rates and engage the administration, student body and local government to all work together, especially in this time of budget cuts,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>Tzankov said his work reaching out to marginalized students prepared him well for the Office of the President.</p>\n<p>“The budget cuts over the last few years have hit the disadvantaged and minority population very hard; it can be seen in the retention rates,” Tzankov said. “I have worked on providing an emergency loan service to disadvantaged and financially marginalized students. As president, I will appoint a Commissioner of Diversity and Equity who would plan events work on publicity.”</p>\n<p>Bettering Our School System’s candidate Marcus Rochellle, a third-year political science major and current finance board member, said he would work on the smaller issues on campus as well as addressing major budget concerns.</p>\n<p>“I believe it’s important to address the issues around campus as well as the bigger budget issues,” Rochellle said. “Improving the way we register for classes and expanding the wireless internet on campus are ways we can take measurable steps to improve lives on a day-to-day basis.”</p>\n<p>Rochellle said student collaboration will be critical for devising realistic solutions to break the cycle of budget cuts that disadvantage UC students.</p>\n<p>“The greatest untapped resource on campus is the students,” Rochellle said. “We need to harness the passion and spirit of the student body to address these issues with a unified front. We can let the state legislature know how much money we can make as graduates of college and how higher education really benefits the state.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36326\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36326\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/","id":3159,"author":{"id":202,"name":"Yishian Yao"},"related":[3158,3157,3156],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/202"}},"__N_SSG":true}
