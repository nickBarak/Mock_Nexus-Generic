These were the icons proudly displayed by the neo-Nazis and white nationalists who crawled out of the woodwork and into Trump’s rallies in 2016. With MAGA supporters chanting “Build the wall!” in one breath and “USA! USA!” in the next, the line between patriotism and nationalism was blurry, at least in the public’s perception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two years later, in 2019, not much had changed. After watching “</span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/fahrenheit-11-9-movie-review-725858/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fahrenheit 11/9</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Michael Moore’s 2016 election documentary, I lay face down on the couch, cynicism coursing through my veins. The sea of devastated faces at Clinton campaign headquarters; the corruption festering in our voting system; Obama drinking the water in Flint — these images leached away what little remained of my faith in this democracy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three days later, I sat in the same spot, a crowd screaming “USA! USA!” on TV again. Only this time, it wasn’t at a Trump rally. It was at a soccer game in Lyon, France.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A soccer dropout at age 10, I’d never had much interest in “the beautiful game.” I would rather watch “Bend It Like Beckham” than sit field-side at my siblings’ matches. Yet I found myself caught up in the excitement of the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, mesmerized not only by the U.S. team’s athletic prowess, but also by the players themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media fed my newfound obsession. I delighted in the training camp vlogs (including one that was </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEbylhNxVZk&amp;t=1s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filmed at UCSB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), player biographies and compilations of funny moments featured on U.S. Soccer’s </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ussoccerdotcom\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I watched these women dominate on the field, crack jokes, work out and sing on buses, cars and planes. Camaraderie was essential to their game: these players were fiercely competitive and fiercely loving of both their sport and one another. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I read about their </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fight for gender parity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, my admiration grew. Players like Alex Morgan have </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfM0LT_TUNQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spoken</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about how beating the drum increases the pressure to win. Yet not once have they folded — not against the U.S. Soccer Federation, which </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/why-the-us-national-womens-soccer-team-is-suing/585202/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pays female athletes nearly a third of what it pays males</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, despite the women’s team consistently outperforming the men’s and generating considerably more revenue — and certainly not against the competition. The team’s victory in the final match amplified the chants of “EQUAL PAY! EQUAL PAY!” that rang throughout Stade de Lyon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feud between Trump and the team, which erupted </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/sports/trump-megan-rapinoe-tweet.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, could not have been more symbolic of the political moment. About halfway through the tournament, a reporter for the soccer magazine Eight by Eight asked co-captain Megan Rapinoe whether or not the team planned to visit the White House if they won. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infinitely more American than the “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> old days</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” of autocracy and white supremacism fondly recalled by Trump is this team’s vision of progress.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not going to the fucking White House,” Rapinoe </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/8by8mag/status/1143595809910530048\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shot back</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The next day, Trump </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1143892328236687361\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retorted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with, “Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!” Their 2-0 victory in the Cup final — including a goal by Rapinoe — spoke for itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which brings me to the centerpiece of my fascination: the lavender-haired winner of the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards, the undisputed star of the World Cup and the new face of women’s soccer, Megan Anna Rapinoe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though her fame reached new heights during this summer’s World Cup, Rapinoe has been a leader on and off the field for years. In 2016, she was one of five players to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">file a federal complaint</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the U.S. Soccer Federation for wage discrimination and is one of 28 plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed three months before the 2019 Cup. She also sparked controversy for </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/soccer/uswnts-megan-rapinoe-kneels-during-national-anthem-solidarity-colin-kaepernick\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kneeling during the national anthem</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of Colin Kaepernick at a Seattle Reign game in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties,” Rapinoe said afterwards. “It’s important to have white people stand in support of people of color on this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team spokesperson, Rapinoe leads with grace and an effervescent sense of humor. She doesn’t talk trash — not even about the head of the U.S. Soccer Federation, Carlos Cordeiro, who was </span><a href=\"https://time.com/5623697/us-soccer-equal-pay-megan-rapinoe/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">booed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the crowd at the team’s post-victory New York City ticker-tape parade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think he’s with us. I think he’s on the right side of things. I think he’s going to make things right,” she said. “We look forward to holding those feet to the fire.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a rousing victory </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEfeFJlwUyQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speech</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Rapinoe addressed, among other things, the diversity of the team: “We have pink hair and purple hair. We have tattoos, dreadlocks. We’ve got white girls, black girls and everything in between. Straight girls, gay girls.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Observing the reactions of the crowd, itself a mishmosh of young and old, white, brown and black, I cannot overstate the importance of this message. Highlighting this intersection of identities is not just preaching to the liberal choir or a PR stunt. The U.S. women’s national team paints a far more accurate picture of America than the almost exclusively white-male Trump administration does. Its players embody the values of compassion, honor and resilience that are so lacking in our national politics. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Rapinoe’s dissent — and absolute kickassery — is a form of patriotism that I can get behind.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is it essential that Americans see themselves in this team but also that the world see </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">America</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this team. Broadcasted on hundreds of networks and reaching a record number of viewers (approximately </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48882465\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) worldwide, the World Cup winning team represented an America that other parts of the world may not otherwise get to see.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infinitely more American than the “</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/27/in-good-old-days-donald-trump-says-campaign-protesters-got-more-than-just-an-escort-out/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good old days</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” of autocracy and white supremacism fondly recalled by Trump is this team’s vision of progress. “This is my charge to everyone: We have to be better. We have to love more, hate less. We’ve got to listen more and talk less,” Rapinoe said as she neared the end of her speech. “It’s our responsibility to make the world a better place.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Team USA’s triumph, much champagne was spilled and “We Are the Champions” sang. But their victory was a celebration of female friendship, sportsmanship and hard work, rather than the boastful nationalism that often colors patriotic rhetoric. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as I love watching these athletes play, I value them more for what they inspire. And I don’t just mean the children who dream of going pro — that doesn’t account for their devoted fan base or the millions who tuned in to watch the World Cup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They inspire me to make the most of the platform I have to advocate for what I believe in. I may be too far gone for the soaring idealism of the American dream, but Megan Rapinoe’s dissent — and absolute kickassery — is a form of patriotism that I can get behind. Her courage moves me profoundly, evoking the same feeling the national anthem used to, the feeling of belonging to something bigger than myself — if not to a country, than to a dream. I am learning that the two are not mutually exclusive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the fall, I will be studying abroad. I used to joke that when asked where I’m from, I’ll just say “California” to avoid being associated with Trump’s America.

Two bites into a baguette smeared with vegan cream cheese (what did I tell you?), the alarm bells started ringing. All the telltale signs were there: the itchiness on my tongue; the feeling of sand filling my throat as it constricts; my lips going pillowy with numbness; my swollen eyelids reducing my eyes to slits; and worst of all, the panic that sends adrenaline pinballing through my body, drumming up my heart rate and alighting every nerve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I checked the label on the container. Sure enough, the first ingredient listed was “RAW CASHEWS.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A moment of callousness and two bites of cream cheese. That’s all it took to launch my immune system into shutdown and my body into the bathroom, where I spent the next hour with my head in the toilet. This time I got lucky: With the aid of some Benadryl, my breathing returned to normal and the vomiting subsided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a thousand ways this situation could have played out, a thousand parallel universes determined by a single detail. What if I hadn’t been with friends who live minutes away from a drugstore? What if I’d been at a party surrounded by strangers? Or in a foreign country? What if my body went into </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anaphylaxis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and I didn’t have my </span><a href=\"https://www.epipen.com/what-is-anaphylaxis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Epi-Pen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with me? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have experienced all of these scenarios in some form or another. From hives at holiday parties to barfing at the beach, I’ve seen it all. So it goes without saying that I am grateful my most recent reaction didn’t land me in the hospital, or worse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, a tiny, irrational part of me wishes it did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes, there is a disparity — a chasm, really — between the emotional and physical scars left by a traumatic event. Each time, my body outpaces my mind in the recovery process; my eyes de-puff before my tears dry. My allergy is life-threatening, meaning that every time I have a reaction, I am faced with the possibility of my own death.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That such a serious medical condition is called an “allergy” strikes me as wildly inappropriate. “Allergy” is a silly word that conjures up images of snot-nosed kids and springtime pollen. It undercuts the terror that seizes me when I realize that something tastes “off.” It makes it difficult for others to empathize with my experiences. No, I don’t live with chronic pain or have to inject myself with medicine on a daily basis. Yes, I am otherwise healthy and able-bodied. But when you live your whole life thinking you could die at any meal, it takes an emotional toll.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, the more drastic the reaction, the easier it is to cope with it. In the wake of a reaction fraught with dramatic details — pastries, Greece, family vacation, deserted island, paramedic tent, no Epi-Pen — I received an outpouring of sympathy from my friends and family. The intensity of their concern matched the misery of the experience. However, this was an exception, not the rule. Reactions that occur under ordinary circumstances, such as Sunday brunch, don’t elicit the same response even though they are no less terrifying for me. This can be extremely isolating, to say the least.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feeling of being heard but not understood makes me want to exaggerate the details of my reactions the way I sometimes embellish stories, a trait at which my friends and family often poke fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was struck by this as I lay in bed after the Bad Brunch, snapping me out of my post-reaction slump. Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My allergy and I have been attached since birth, our fates tied together by the pad thai noodles that sent me to the hospital at age one. I can’t remember living without it, and </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data indicates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that I probably never will. Which means that for better or worse, my nut allergy is woven into the fabric of my being. If personalities are like smoothies — a random blend of family, culture, DNA and environment — who’s to say it wasn’t a formative ingredient? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some manifestations are positive, highlighting aspects of my personality that may have otherwise remained in the shadows. I was always a precocious child, the kind that enjoyed talking to adults and hogged the camera in all the home videos. Yet my engraved emergency bracelet was my first real taste of the spotlight. I would shake my chubby fist at anyone who would listen, reveling in the attention it garnered me. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually I graduated from bracelet-waving to bragging, as if being in constant latent danger was cool. I feel lucky for myself and my parents that I was such an obnoxious kid, never hesitating to announce my allergy to anyone offering me food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also credit my allergy for my Doomsday Prepper tendencies. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have to carry a chunky plastic medicine stick and 1-2 tablets of Benadryl with you everywhere, you become one of those people who anticipates disaster at every turn. I have since blossomed into a one-woman drugstore, never without band-aids, floss, tampons or gum on hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up with a severe allergy also prematurely exposed me to some dark truths. The most heartbreaking lesson of childhood is that your parents can’t protect you from everything</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I learned this early on. Proactive and careful as they were, my parents couldn’t be there every time there was an incident. In fact, they were the accidental perpetrators of a few reactions. To chalk up my neuroses and distrust of adults to a nut allergy might seem, well, nuts, but it can’t be dismissed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would I wish a fatal food allergy on anyone else? No. Can I imagine my life without it? Strangely, also no.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s part of who I am, for better or worse. The disadvantages of a fatal allergy are obvious.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They read like the side effects delivered in hyperspeed at the end of a commercial: nausea, vomiting, swelling, redness, anaphylaxis, death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the upsides? I am long past the point of considering attention one of them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o amount of pity or compassion can counteract the trauma or resulting isolation. Moreover, I do not subscribe to the “everything happens for a reason” theory </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s disrespectful toward the victims of senseless tragedies and frankly, it’s bullshit. Some clouds are gray without a touch of silver. Some lemons are just meant to be lemons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet despite the drawbacks, having a severe allergy has gifted me with an alternative perspective on my own life. Along with all of the other timelines by which we organize our lives </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationships, family pets, schools, career milestones </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exists my personal history of reactions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The details surrounding these incidents are forever vivid in my mind: the holiday decor at the Christmas Party where I ate white chocolate walnut fudge at age nine; the sunlight and rolling green hills at my second grade field trip, crumbs glinting off the knife that had been used to cut a peanut butter cookie moments before; the security of my mom’s hand around mine when she picked me up from kindergarten after a classmate’s birthday cake made me sick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While allergic reactions make for unpleasant memories, they go hand in hand with special moments that I wouldn’t recall otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is, however, one definitive benefit of having a deathly allergy: It gives people a way to show that they care about you. There’s a line in “Lady Bird” that goes, “Don’t you think they’re the same thing? Love and attention?” In this case, I think they are. Considering how nuts are exceedingly normal and harmless for about 95% of the population, a person needs a reason to care about their presence. I am that reason for my loved ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time someone takes extra precautions to ensure my safety, I feel like they’ve just handed me a present. Like when my friend Samantha insists on asking the waiter if the pizza we ordered has nuts, even though I’ve read the menu twice and pizza never has nuts, idiot.

Is this a supernatural occurrence? The end of life as we know it? Before we can wrap our heads around this, the scene ends abruptly. A cell materializes on the screen and begins to divide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lest there be any confusion, a voiceover tells us, “This is a cell… one became two. Two became four. Then eight…” and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening sequence is a microcosm for the rest of the movie. Based on Jeff VanderMeer’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Southern Reach</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trilogy, “Annihilation” strives for philosophical sci-fi by being as ambiguous as possible while simultaneously explaining itself to death. While visually stunning and occasionally thrilling, its structure is incoherent and its storytelling is contrived. Garland’s use of the “show, don’t tell” technique is what made “Ex Machina” an outstanding first feature. “Annihilation” tells rather than shows, and that is where it runs into problems.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The disembodied voice from the cell tutorial belongs to Lena (Natalie Portman),  a soldier-turned-biologist and university professor. A hokey conversation with a colleague reveals that her personal life is in shambles. Her husband Kane (Oscar Isaac), who embarked on a top-secret military mission a year prior and never returned, is presumed dead. That afternoon, however, who should walk in but Kane himself. Lena is bewildered and overcome with joy. Kane is equally confused, but seems cold and distant. It becomes clear that he is seriously ill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On their way to the hospital, Lena and Kane are intercepted by the military. They are taken to a sprawling, remote complex that is home to a government agency tasked with gathering intel about Area X. The Shimmer, as it is also known, is an ever-expanding forcefield that resembles a giant soap bubble. A psychologist named Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) informs Lena that it was caused by a meteor crash (yeah, that one). She also explains that venturing into the Shimmer is “a suicide mission.” Kane is the only person to ever make it out alive, and now he is dying. Ventress is leading a final expedition, along with a team of specialists: Cass (Tuva Nuvotny), an anthropologist, Josie (Tessa Thompson), a physicist and Anya (Gina Rodriguez), a paramedic. Lena is allowed to tag along for her expertise in biology, which ends up being the only discipline relevant to their mission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The expedition leads them into a world which defies all laws of nature and science. Everything in the Shimmer is genetically mutated: plants take on humanoid form, animals become grotesque monsters and everything is covered in rainbow-colored fungi. Things start to fall apart as they uncover what happened on the previous mission and undergo grueling physical and psychological experiences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such an intriguing premise, “Annihilation” had the potential for greatness. However, the complexity of the set-up is unmatched by its characters. Nothing screams “written and directed by a man” more than flat, one-dimensional female roles. Movies dominated by women, especially female scientists, are few and far between. Here was an opportunity to create empowering, nuanced characters with a star-studded cast, and “Annihilation” completely squandered it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of what makes it difficult to feel emotionally attached to these characters is that we know nothing about them. The script tries to make up for this with heavy-handed dialogue. Midway through their journey, Cass and Lena share a canoe and discuss the dangers of their mission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cass says that only messed-up people volunteer to go into the Shimmer: “We’re all damaged goods here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then outlines what makes each woman a “damaged good,” naming every cliche from substance abuse to mental illness. It’s one of many bits that uses cheap, contrived dialogue to quickly dole out information. Twice, Ventress shrieks, “It’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">annihilation!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” as if to remind us what movie we’re watching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these flaws, “Annihilation” might be worth seeing, if only for the last 20 minutes. Afterward, I found that I’d crumpled up my ticket in suspense. Garland’s style shines in scenes with limited dialogue, scenes that show instead of tell. A stress-inducing electronic score and mind-blowing effects contribute to the gripping action. At other parts of the movie, some of the special effects felt overdone, making it somewhat hard to buy into the world of the Shimmer. Here, they steal the show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key ingredient to any great science-fiction story is likable characters to whom the audience feels emotionally attached. It’s difficult to care about a movie when the fate of its characters seems utterly inconsequential. “Annihilation” is a visual feast and highly suspenseful, even downright scary at times. However, it’s hard to get around the lackluster characters, overworked dialogue and vague conclusion. Ultimately, “Annihilation” is akin to the look in Kane’s eyes after he returns from the Shimmer: empty, meaningless and devoid of feeling.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Annihilation” is currently playing in wide release.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7283.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Harper Lambert</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Harper Lambert is the editor-in-chief for the 2020-2021 school year.

Menu</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love animals. So do you, right? You might have walked past quite a few dogs on your way to class, even stopped for a moment to pet one of them. Maybe you have a puppy at home or your house is filled with cats or you have a rabbit that you just absolutely adore. Me? I have two dogs, a chinchilla and three birds back at home, and I can say with certainty that I love them all. Every six in ten Americans has a pet. Why do so many people turn to animals for companionship? Well, we aren’t as different from animals as we think.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all seek happiness. We all do our best to avoid pain. Have you ever accidentally stepped on your dog’s paw and then felt like the most loathsome human imaginable? Why did you then continue to apologize profusely to your dog, even though you knew Buddy didn’t understand a single word you just said? </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do this because we know that even though our pets can’t express their emotions in the same way as humans, they still </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Dogs, like humans — like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> animals — experience love and happiness, loneliness and fear, pain and suffering. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, every year, over 70 billion animals are raised and slaughtered in ways that would bring any human being with an ounce of compassion in their soul to tears.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we believe it is okay — even ethical — to eat certain animals but not others?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On factory farms, cows, pigs and chickens are crammed into filthy feedlots and injected with hormones, stimulants and antibiotics. Many of these animals are fed “renders,” which can range anywhere from dead and ground up cows to diseased animals, roadkill and euthanized pets instead of proper meals.  They live out their short lives bloodied, battered, breathing in toxic fumes, covered in sores and unable to move an inch, until they finally wind up as the ground beef for your Tuesday night tacos or the chicken nuggets you just ate for lunch. When I was younger, my family and I had the urge to save a hummingbird from dying outside in the cold, while also continuing to eat chicken for dinner. Why do we believe it is okay — even ethical — to eat certain animals but not others? We are conditioned at a young age to believe that cows, pigs, chickens, sheep and fish are somehow lesser than the dogs, cats, bunnies and horses that we love so dearly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ignorance, apathy and hypocrisy of humans all sustain this unsustainable lifestyle of factory farming. In addition to the ethical immorality, consuming animals also has drastic ramifications for our planet. While 13 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions is due to transportation, including road, rail, air and marine, a whopping 51 percent is due to breeding livestock and their byproducts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, carpooling instead of driving solo, biking to and from work and even cutting down driving won’t be enough to save us, although doing all of these are still beneficial. In the United States, 55 percent of our water use goes toward animal agriculture, whereas five percent of water use is domestic or used for drinking, showering, washing dishes, etc. Consequently, shortening our showers and fixing leaky plumbing only saves a drop or two in the bucket. As if the effects of this industry weren’t already concerning enough, every minute, the animals bred for food produce seven million pounds of excrement. Lovely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with these facts, you still might remain apathetic to the detrimental effects animal agriculture has on the environment — it’s not like we only have one life-sustaining planet or anything. Climate change, water use, deforestation, species extinction, fisheries, land use and waste — all of these are severely affected by animal agriculture, whether we want to acknowledge our harsh reality or not. Every second, animals die and the earth pays for our ignorance, delusion and indifference. With billions of us consuming meat daily, the implications are frightening. Every day, we hear snippets of the environmental disaster surrounding us: Species of animals and plants are rapidly becoming extinct.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start cutting down the amount of meat in your diet. Then, if you’re feeling brave, cut it all out. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of ocean dead zones is increasing. Every day, we have the choice to turn a blind eye or to do something. The excuse, “I’m just one person. What difference can I make?” just won’t cut it anymore. When the production of one hamburger patty requires 660 gallons of water — the equivalent of showering for two months — the impact each individual person has is huge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, there is hope. An entirely plant-based diet reduces your carbon footprint by 50 percent, but even consciously making the effort to reduce our meat intake makes a substantial difference. Although the ultimate, sustainable goal would be for everyone to become vegan, I’m taking baby steps. By removing animals from my menu, I’ve already come a long way from being the girl who posted a picture of her In-N-Out cheeseburger on Instagram a few years ago with the profound caption, “Wow” and the heart-eye emoji. After nearly a year and a half of being vegetarian, I can definitely say the change was worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start cutting down the amount of meat in your diet. Then, if you’re feeling brave, cut it all out. Start reducing the amount of animal products in your diet. Then, make the choice to remove them entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having compassion for animals is better for the animals. It’s better for your body. It’s better for your soul. It’s better for the environment. Having compassion for animals is better for the world.</span></p>\n<p><em>Calista Liu wants everyone to consider the ethical consequences of meat-eating.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Plant-Based Privilege: Why Veganism Needs a New Approach</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years ago, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PETA.org</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published an article entitled “Top 10 Reasons to Go Vegan in the New Year.” Nestled between valid reasons like “save the planet” and “help feed the world” was this: “All the cool kids are doing it,” followed by a list of high-profile celebrities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name-dropping those who “regularly appear in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magazine” is usually a failsafe marketing strategy. When it comes to veganism, however, this method is counterproductive. It makes veganism seem pretentious, undermining its personal benefits and positive impact. Worse, it contributes to the misconception that this lifestyle is only for the wealthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, veganism is a privilege that not everyone can afford. Being able to subsist comfortably on an animal-free diet is only possible with sufficient time and money. Poor people are never included in conversations about going meatless and eating green. Those who say “anyone can go vegan” are turning a blind eye to classism, poverty and how the meat industry profits off of both.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a reason why going full herbivore is called “converting.” Most people find the transition difficult because their favorite foods contain butter, eggs or milk. Ingredients like soy, rice, almond and coconut are popular substitutes for the real thing. They make the switch not just tolerable, but enjoyable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re also significantly more expensive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writer Antonia Noori Farzan published an article about the cost of these alternative products. Over the course of a month, she compared the prices of her purchases to their non-vegan counterparts. In total, eating vegan costs her roughly $100 a month. If you’re a member of the middle class, that’s pricey. If you’re one of the 40 million Americans making minimum wage, that’s unthinkable.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those living at or below the poverty line don’t possess the money, time or cooking equipment to accommodate a vegan diet.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veganism, however, is about more than paying for food — it’s also about having the time to prepare it. Vegan or not, home-cooked meals are both labor- and time-consuming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with meat and dairy substitutes (whose absence would “take the joy out of eating”), cooking made it easier for fellow Gaucho Lily Garcia-Daly to convert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was really lucky to have a family that supported my lifestyle change. Not everyone has a mom who would buy them almond milk in addition to normal milk for the rest of the fam[sic]. Not only did she encourage me to make my own meals, but she also made plant-based meals for my non-vegan family,” Garcia-Daly said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those living at or below the poverty line don’t possess the money, time or cooking equipment to accommodate a vegan diet. Some parents work multiple jobs or round-the-clock shifts to support their families. This leaves little time for stewing lentils or grilling tofu burgers. Even if cost wasn’t an issue, there’s no vegan equivalent of McDonald’s or KFC. Vegan options at fast food establishments are nonexistent, unless you count french fries. Even so, fast food is unhealthy and unsustainably grown, fundamentally clashing with vegan values.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, fast food is the only option for those living in extreme poverty. While they aren’t America’s largest consumers of fast food, poor people are preyed upon by the industry more than other members of society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the result of “food deserts,” which the fast food industry helped to create. Food deserts are low-income neighborhoods in which healthy and affordable food is scarce. In these same neighborhoods, Wendy’s and Taco Bells flourish on every corner. The multi-billion-dollar meat, agriculture and fast food industries collude to make their products cheap and easily accessible. As a result, obesity is rising in low-income areas and has surpassed smoking as a leading cause of death. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to go vegan isn’t as simple as plants versus meat or right versus wrong.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These industries work together to trap the marginalized in a vicious cycle of poverty. The fast food industry is one of the most unequal industries in the U.S. While their CEOs are among the highest paid, their employees are by far the lowest paid. The meat and agriculture industries pocket an enormous profit from overworking and underpaying their employees. Many of these laborers are undocumented immigrants with no other employment opportunities. Fast food corporations profit as well, exploiting their workers and selling their labor back to them in the form of hamburgers and chicken nuggets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these industries have the lower class right where they want it: on both sides of the counter. There is no place for veganism in the struggle to survive on minimum wage. It’s not even a topic of conversation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, claiming that veganism is universally accessible is ignorant. Preaching that veganism is morally superior is similarly inconsiderate. The implication that anyone who doesn’t convert doesn’t care about the earth vilifies the underprivileged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More importantly, it distracts people from the task at hand: finding solutions. The decision to go vegan isn’t as simple as plants versus meat or right versus wrong. Budget, schedule and family size also need to be taken into consideration. Veganism’s mission goes beyond winning over individuals — it involves tackling the intertwined injustices of the immigration system, poverty and the meat industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than imposing judgment, advocates of veganism should focus on education and activism. There are also smaller-scale fixes. Vegans can encourage people to cut down on food waste and meat consumption, buy locally if they can afford it and teach people how to do their best with limited resources. The food industries may be rich and powerful, but there are still opportunities to affect change through individual action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, a plant-based diet is doable for most Americans. Protein sources like meat and dairy can be swapped out for beans, nuts and grains without additional cost. But to realize the vision of a sustainable food economy, veganism must be presented as more accessible and less elite.
