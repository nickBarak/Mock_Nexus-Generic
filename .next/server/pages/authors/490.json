Let’s call him a “noncommittal dating partner.” Understandably, however, he was often mistaken for a boyfriend by innocent bystanders.</p>\n<p>“Fine,” the girl thought. “He wants to keep it casual? I’ll show him casual.” So the girl didn’t call him during the week, and he used the freedom to attend college night at the local bowling alley. Now that I’ve mentioned college night, let’s back up for a minute. Now would be a good time to mention the fact that the man in question is 31 years old. While Wednesday night at Zodo’s is all well and good for 21-year-olds, there’s an unspoken age limit.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there he was at the bowling alley. Meanwhile, his non-girlfriend was at home partaking in her standard Wednesday evening activity: drinking herbal tea and pondering her coolness. “God, it is so awesome of me to let my noncommittal dating partner do his thing ALL THE TIME and never even question him about it. He’s so lucky to have me,” she thought, blissfully unaware that he was not in fact standing in the bowling alley, thinking about how laid-back she was. Rather, he was getting age-inappropriately drunk, trying to forget about his now-dysfunctional man parts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Let’s rewind to a couple months before this particular night at Zodo’s. The girl and her noncommittal dating partner had been seeing each other for a few weeks at that point, and while they were having fun, there seemed to be an unspoken agreement that the relationship was not going to become serious. Though the girl didn’t tell the 31-year-old man at the time, there were a few reasons she was okay with the arrangement: A) He doesn’t read. Repeat after me: He does not read. In fact, the only thing he reads is <em>Maxim</em> magazine … when he’s enjoying some bathroom time; and then, of course, there’s B) He never complained when she made him watch <em>The Bachelor</em>, and actually seemed to enjoy the show. Unless you’re gay or my dad, that’s an unacceptable male hobby.</p>\n<p>Oh, wait, there’s one other thing that would validate being a grown ass man and voluntarily watching a ridiculous reality show aimed at 18-year-old girls: you’re doing it to get laid. There are probably millions of blue-blooded American men who spend their Monday evenings watching dudes with weird hair present desperate women with roses, all in the hopes that they’ll receive over-the-pants handy J’s during commercial breaks and then go full throttle once the rose ceremony is over. In this particular case, the girl hoped that was the reason for her noncommittal dating partner’s acceptance — and occasional downright enthusiasm — over watching <em>The Bachelor</em>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps naively, she thought she could have the best of both worlds: someone who was</p>\n<p>willing to watch a mindless reality show and engage in quickies whenever the dialogue got boring. With that in mind, she climbed on top of the man during a commercial break one Monday night. At first, he responded by gently making out with her and even moving to second base. But as soon as the bachelor’s voice boomed in the background, he couldn’t shove her away fast enough. Laughing, the girl (who thought that if she couldn’t get a commitment out of this man, she could at least get some decent sex) closed the laptop and reached for the zipper on his pants. Not laughing, he opened the laptop and informed the half-naked girl prepping for a blowjob that he “wants to see who will get the rose.”</p>\n<p>… What?</p>\n<p>She should have forced herself to break it off (literally, figuratively, metaphorically or all of the above) right then. But she mistook his sexual disinterest for reality show super-fandom and let it go. She would find out later that he was avoiding his not-so-fuck-buddy’s attempt at a BJ because he knew something she didn’t: he doesn’t like blowjobs. Or sex. [Editor’s note: The upcoming sentence was difficult to write and is likely to make everyone involved cringe and mutter condolences to the poor guy.] He didn’t want anything to touch his penis because he cannot keep it up.</p>\n<p>The next week, the same situation repeated itself. Girls pranced around on the TV screen, and the girl, still oblivious to any sort of long-term problem, got bored with the show and reached for his man area. He recoiled and muttered something about “issues” and “taking longer than other guys,” as he zipped up his pants and headed for the bathroom, probably to read Maxim and attempt to jack off. The naive, sexually-frustrated heroine of this saga sighed as she lay back on her pillows, thinking longingly of the men in her past who were blessed with functional plumbing.</p>\n<p>Later, when the nearly illiterate 31-year-old arrived at her house to have the break-up talk, the girl nodded, smiled and bit her tongue on more than one occasion. “This is really hard,” he said, fighting back tears. <em>No, it’s really not</em>, she thought, trying not to let her eyes travel to his man part region. “I’m just glad we’re getting out of this before I’m in too deep,” he continued. <em>No danger of that</em>, she thought with a sigh.</p>\n<p>So concludes the tale of the sexless fuck buddy. The girl, who doesn’t understand penises and probably never will, could tell countless other similar stories, but they all have the same moral: you can’t have sex with something that doesn’t want to, and you can’t not have sex with someone who doesn’t want a relationship. Reread that last sentence. Promise it makes sense.</p>\n<p><em>Dana Olsen is a UCSB graduate and an ex-Hump columnist.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-01/lessons-bachelor-older-sexless-buddy-2/","id":6405,"author":{"id":490,"name":"Dana Olsen"},"related":[6404,6403,6402],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The “Real World” Really Does Suck (And Not in That Way)","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Four long years ago, I was a senior in college.

I don’t remember much about that year (but that’s the subject of another column entirely—perhaps Memoirs of an Old Town Tavern Addict or Long Island Iced Tea For Dummies), but I do remember this: I would have paid for a chance to write The Wednesday Hump. Happily, I somehow tricked the editors into paying me with a little bit of money and the privilege to spend time in the beautiful Daily Nexus office.</p>\n<p>The day UCSB forced me to graduate was the worst day of my life. Not only were my friends and I thrust into the big bad world of jobs and close-toed shoes, but I no longer had an excuse to spend weekends conducting research for a sex column. (Mom, if you’re reading this, please mentally replace ‘sex’ with ‘relationship’ and, of course, immediately stop reading.) The summer after graduation was a dark time for me. There was a void where vibrating cock rings and weekly trips to The Adult Store had once been. But then I had an epiphany! I know, I thought. I’ll go to law school!</p>\n<p>What? You may be asking yourself what law school and The Adult Store could possibly have in common. Good question. You see, four years at UCSB had brainwashed me into thinking that people enjoy fun. In my law school fantasy, I would waltz into the administration office and charm the dean into granting me the first sex column a law school had ever seen. It would be called On the Bench or Under the Robe or some other vaguely suggestive courtroom reference. There was only one flaw in my master plan: law school is a serious place. So serious, in fact, that I never got the courage to propose my idea.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Actually, that’s not strictly true. I did propose it to a few of my classmates, but rather than starting a petition, my new friends simply Googled my name, started an e-mail chain with links to The Wednesday Hump and unwittingly ruined my already-slim chance of ever obtaining employment as a lawyer. I don’t know if you know this, but lawyers don’t like to hire people who once wrote an article about the most polite way to reject a threesome. Fair enough. I wouldn’t hire me, either.</p>\n<p>Although my hopes of becoming the Carrie Bradshaw of law school were dashed, I stayed because I was already there. Perhaps that’s not the best reason to commit three years of your life to something, but the rationale made sense in my 22-year-old mind. Also, Cosmo didn’t respond to my pathetic (or awesome —however you want to look at it) letter in which I pled for a job, a mailroom internship or anything that would get me out of law school and into the hallways of Hearst. So I finished law school. I graduated this past May and here I am, pleading with the editors of the Daily Nexus for the chance to write one more Wednesday Hump.</p>\n<p>To the three of you who are still reading, please, heed my advice: You have four (or three… or two… or one!) years to have innovative sex. Use them. As I’m sure your parents, siblings and older friends have told you, everything is better in college. Before your life becomes a clusterfuck of embarrassing job interviews, long-distance friendships and quarter-life crises, take pleasure — literally and figuratively — in your current state of freedom. Whether you’re in a relationship, playing the field, or enjoying a ‘complicated’ hook-up situation, make sure you partake in the things that become inappropriate the minute you graduate.</p>\n<p>Let me provide you with an example: My college boyfriend and I liked to break away from Friday night ragers to have sex on the stairs leading from the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive down to the beach. I’m sure we weren’t the only ones. In fact, there were nights the stairs were shared. I never considered it at the time, but those nights were fleeting. If I did that now, I would spend the entire night craning my neck to make sure nobody was watching. And if I attempted it in 10 years, I would probably break my neck.</p>\n<p>Aside from where you do it, embrace how you do it. My favorite Wednesday Hump research was for a column I wrote about ballcuzzis. Although the lucky guy and I later agreed that ballcuzzis sound better than they feel, sneaking into his parent’s kitchen to heat up a bowl of milk and find a straw was a novelty. If his parents had caught us then, they probably would have rolled their eyes. Now that we’re supposedly old enough to know better, both generations would be mortified.</p>\n<p>My point is this: Carpe diem.
