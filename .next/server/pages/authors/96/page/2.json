Zavala and Garcia presented their platforms and informed students about the office of the Student Advocate General, an A.S Executive office designed to help students with legal disputes, navigate casework and act as a liaison between students and UCSB Office of Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p>To begin the forum, the A.S moderator asked the two candidates what defined the role of the Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>Garcia said the primary responsibility of the Student Advocate General is to protect and uphold the rights of students.</p>\n<p>“The role of the Student Advocate General is to be a public defender,” Garcia said. “It’s to make advocating for students a primary concern, and make sure you spend time and effort on the struggles that students face in their everyday lives.”</p>\n<p>Zavala said the Student Advocate General serves to provide an unbiased space for students to voice their problems.</p>\n<p>“The role is to make sure students get their right for due process, whether it be through judicial affairs or the various other resources on campus,” Zavala said. “The Office of the Student Advocate General is supposed to have a staff with a non-partisan perspective that is there to provide students with the help they need.”</p>\n<p>Zavala said her experience working under three past student advocate generals and acting as unofficial student advocate general prepared her to actively take on the role. If elected, Zavala said she would implement a Gaucho safety app, legal observers for the office and residence hall accessibility spaces.</p>\n<p>“Working in the office, I’ve seen a huge gap in accessibility for students living in the residence halls,” said Zavala. “If elected it would be a primary concern to make sure the spaces in the residence halls like Santa Catalina and San Rafael are utilized to provide students with a way to get to resources without having to travel.”</p>\n<p>While acknowledging the differences between herself and Zavala, Garcia said she would also focus on making the Office of Student Advocate General readily available to students.</p>\n<p>“Although my experience level is different, my experience is crucial for the office to be successful,” Garcia said. “Having served as a co-chair for Student Commission on Racial Equality and the co-chair for United States Student Association, I know how to represent the student body, and I want to create an office that listens to the students.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Candidates also answered questions about police presence in Isla Vista and minority representation in A.S., as well as addressing scenarios in which students would request help from the student advocate general regarding legal issues.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">President’s Candidate Forum</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_62368\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62368\" data-attachment-id=\"62368\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-forum-brings-candidates-to-the-hub/president-panel-_-hari-patel-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428934699\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"President Panel _ Hari Patel-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62368\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62368\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A.S. Presidential candidates Jimmy Villarreal (left) and Jason Garshfield (right). <em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Candidates for presidency in the upcoming Associated Students election held a forum in the Hub in the University Center on Monday discussing goals and policies for their potential terms next year.</p>\n<p>Jason Garshfield is running for A.S. President with the party he founded — the Free Thinking Patriots party (FTP) — and Jimmy Villarreal is running for A.S. President with the Open People’s Party (OPP).</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Garshfield said the main focus of FTP is to represent students and their opinions.</p>\n<p>“Our party platform is fairly simple. It was designed to represent the students of this university in a way they are not currently being represented in this association,” Garshfield said.</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major Villarreal said OPP has many goals in mind for the next year pertaining to UCSB campus as well as Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Some of the things we really want to work on this year is varied areas such as academic excellence, fiscal responsibility, safety in Isla Vista, rolling back tuition and mental health,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he hopes to address police presence in Isla Vista as A.S. president.</p>\n<p>“If there has been a voice for civil liberties on the current A.S. board, I haven’t heard it,” Garshfield said. “Some students are happy with policing here, some aren’t. I’m going into politics so I can provide some sort of balance.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he believes the police presence in Isla Vista is too great, and I.V. should demonstrate the ability to function well without the current high levels of police occupation.</p>\n<p>“I want to work with the community and the police presence here,” Villarreal said. “I agree with Jason — there is too many police here and that is a natural response to what happened last year. But I think we need to show each other and the police presence here that we can take care of our own community and we can govern ourselves.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal also said funding mental health services is one of his top priorities to create a safe resource and community for mental health patients.</p>\n<p>“Mental health — that’s something I am very passionate about,” Villarreal said. “I am going to be working to bring a $125,000 federal grant so we can provide mental health first aid training to every student who would like it.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said freedom of speech is one of his main concerns and he is unsatisfied with UCSB’s current ranking provided by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is given a yellow light by F.I.R.E.,” Garshfield said. “I think that is unacceptable for a university of our caliber and as A.S. President I will work to modify speech codes so that they ban forms of harassment, forms of inappropriate behavior while allowing students the whole gamut of freedom of speech.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he hopes to assist students by expanding program such as the A.S. Food Bank, increasing grants and scholarship availability and communicating student opinion on a UC-wide level.</p>\n<p>“Some things we are going to do is to expand the A.S. Food Bank from three days a week to five days a week, as well as creating more scholarships and job opportunities for students,” Villareal said. “Finally, I am going to be working on a statewide level to bring every single students concerns to Janet Napolitano, to the Regents, to the state legislature.”</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, the self-governance issue in Isla Vista could be solved simply by opening more businesses in I.V., which would create competition as well as tax revenue to effectively convert I.V. into a city.</p>\n<p>“I think AB 3 doesn’t go far enough; I’d like to see Isla Vista become a city,” Garshfield said. “The reason that I’ve been told that that’s not feasible at this time is because of tax revenue. Bringing businesses into Isla Vista — I think that will bring down prices and that will bring up quality, and will help us become a city, and finally end this self-governance issue once and for all.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Collegiate Senator Candidate Forum</strong></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_62366\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62366\" data-attachment-id=\"62366\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-forum-brings-candidates-to-the-hub/collegiate-senator-panel_vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428924056\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"220\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Collegiate Senator Panel_Vivian Bui-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62366\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62366\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Six OPP members running for collegiate senator seats. <em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Six candidates running for positions as collegiate senators representing the College of Letters and Science (L&amp;S), the College of Creative Studies (CCS) and the College of Engineering spoke at a candidate’s forum in the Hub yesterday in preparation for the upcoming Associated Students elections.</p>\n<p>Four candidates will ultimately be elected to represent L&amp;S, one for CCS and one for Engineering as prescribed by the A.S. Legal Code. All six candidates at the forum are running with the Open People’s Party (OPP).</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, a second-year history of public policy major running for L&amp;S collegiate senator, said his past experience includes reforming police relations with the Isla Vista community and helping organize events such as Pizza with Police.</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked with police, primarily with Deltopia,” Minoiefar said. “Being an intermediary between the police and residents, letting them know of different ordinances that were in place, and letting them know if they were in violation of these ordinances.”</p>\n<p>According to Minoiefar, he is in constant contact with Lt. Rob Plastino of Isla Vista Foot Patrol to come up with solutions to safety issues for large-scale celebrations such as Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“Since Halloween I’ve been meeting weekly with Plastino and these meetings have resulted in many things,” Minoiefar said. “Primarily on the day of Deltopia we had the UCF program, like I mentioned is a volunteer program, and passed out over 5,000 water bottles.”</p>\n<p>Niki Elyasi, a second-year biopsychology major running for L&amp;S senator, said she hopes to create more resources for students on campus, such as greater numbers of campus study areas and a tutor service for students in majors in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).</p>\n<p>“I hope to establish a STEM mentor program as well as create more study spaces on campus,” Elyasi said. “Students don’t have to cram into the library or be uncomfortable throughout midterms or finals week.”</p>\n<p>According to Elyasi, she plans to communicate frequently with students and represent them effectively as a collegiate senator.</p>\n<p>“I hope that next year as senator this is something that I will be able to do very very well, to minimize the gap between students and their representatives,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<p>Dustin Larrazolo, a second-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major running for CCS senator, said he wants to work to increase diversity and representation in CCS programs.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to bring issues of diversity into CCS because it’s a fairly uniform program in the university that we see,” Larrazolo said. “A lot of students from underrepresented backgrounds aren’t really addressed with specific needs that need to be tailored to them.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said, as a queer student himself, he aims to make changes to CCS to ensure inclusivity towards people with different sexualities.</p>\n<p>“I want to also bring up the queer issues, as I am a gay student in CCS,” Larrazolo said. “There are a lot of students who are gay and lesbian or unidentified in CCS and I want to have their experiences be just as great as everyone else’s.”</p>\n<p>Heather Vest, a third-year biology major running for L&amp;S senator, said she is passionate about environmental issues and specifically wants to address the current drought and examine UCSB’s efforts to conserve water.</p>\n<p>“I hope to work on environmental issues across the campus including drought awareness,” Vest said. “We’re in a severe drought so I want to understand why our campus is so green compared to everywhere else in California.”</p>\n<p>Vest said she wants to provide specific resources including grants and on campus support groups to aid financially struggling students.</p>\n<p>“I also want to work with underprivileged students, like students with increasing hardships, especially financial hardships,” Vest said.</p>\n<p>Sara Maroofi, a third-year mechanical engineering major running for engineering collegiate senator, said there are programs available only on campus that students require, which she wants to make more accessible.</p>\n<p>“I would really like to help spread the software that a lot of engineers have used across the campus,” Maroofi said. “[The labs] often get crowded during midterms and finals so I’d really like to increase accessibility to labs for students on campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Maroofi, her position as a resident assistant with UCSB Housing and Residential Services allowed her to organize programs to integrate students and address diversity.</p>\n<p>“The first thing that comes up in a lot of people’s mind is race, however diversity also includes sexual orientation identity, race, class and gender,” Maroofi said. “Oftentimes these get forgotten and as an RA here at UCSB I’ve put on programs to help remind people of these issues.”</p>\n<p>Stevan Abdalmalik, a second-year history of public policy major running for L&amp;S collegiate senator, said he plans to actively work against UC tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>“Our state government has chosen to underfund your education,” Abdalmalik said. “Next year, your education will cost $500 more than it already does this year, and your financial aid will not be able to recover it, meaning you’ll have to take out more student loans.”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said he recently lobbied in Sacramento to increase funding and successfully got two bills endorsed by two different congressmen.</p>\n<p>“As a lobby trader, I’ve been up to Sacramento several times this year to lobby on behalf of our students to ask our state to fund us,” Abdalmalik said. “I was just in DC two weeks ago, asking our Congress to stop the raid on student aid and fund higher education.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Photographs published in his earlier book<em> Juvenile in Justice</em> have been on exhibit nationwide and used as a tool for advocates for juvenile justice system reform. Images from his new book are currently on display on the first floor of the library.</p>\n<p>Ross, who previously worked as a photographer for <em>Time Magazine</em>, <em>Newsweek</em> and the<em> New York Times</em>, said he wants his exhibits and books to spark change in the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“I’m not a judge; I’m not a probation officer. I’m an artist; I’m a human being,” Ross said. “I decided with my work I’m going to use art as a weapon.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids. – Art professor and photographer Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Ross, one of the underlying issues within the juvenile justice system is that “as a society, we bully kids.”</p>\n<p>“If you bully someone who is a person of color, you might get some pushback, you might be sued,” Ross said. “Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while there have been improvements made in the system since the publication of <em>Juvenile in Justice</em> three years ago, the situation for incarcerated girls has worsened.</p>\n<p>“The population of girls increases in relation to boys and girls have unique problems,” Ross said. “That’s why I published the book on girls to focus exactly on what’s going on with them.”</p>\n<p>Ross shared dozens of examples of his images, including one comparison between a detention cell in El Paso, Texas to one at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>“This holds the worst terrorist in the world.

It’s a terrible system and I hope Rikers gets better.”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, while solitary confinement is an issue of national importance, it also pervades the local justice system in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The state is supposed to act as the parent when the parent can’t,” Ross said. “But these are the closets that we put kids in. They’re under the guise of administrative segregation, time-out rooms and desensitization rooms. In Santa Barbara, I interviewed a kid that was in there for three weeks.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while visiting a detention center in Monterey Park, Calif., he came to understand that the large percentage of incarcerated youths are victims of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>“I asked the director what percentage of girls had been sexually abused when they come here,” Ross said. “He said ‘What percentage? Every one of them. All 88 girls in our custody have been sexually abused’ and then he said ‘and most of the boys.’ They’re all victims of abuse.”</p>\n<p>Jessica Sparks, an assistant with the Davidson Library Outreach Department and a third-year English and Renaissance studies major, said she was shocked by the sheer number of incarcerated youth that Ross’s project has revealed have been abused.</p>\n<p>“I thought it wasn’t that many, but hearing it was all of them it brings a whole new level of depth to the pictures downstairs,” Sparks said.</p>\n<p>According to Ross, many children in the juvenile justice system are suffering the consequences of their parents’ poor decisions.</p>\n<p>“A girl that was doing 35 years — she murdered somebody,” Ross said. “She was high on meth. Her mother gave her meth when she was seven. This girl has already served about ten years . . . she was sentenced at 14 and is going to serve until she’s 34.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community. These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result. – Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ross said one director of a detention center shared with him the difficulty of protecting transgender youth within the system.</p>\n<p>“Often they are thrown out of their family and have to respond with survival — sex to eat, to sleep, to live,” Ross said. “The director said [of a male to female transgender youth] ‘If I put her in with the girls, she’ll be hurt. If I put her in with the boys, she’ll be killed. I keep her in isolation, I know it’s against federal law . . . But she is not going to be killed on my watch.’”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, African American and Latino youths are at a higher risk of being tried as adults.</p>\n<p>“Latino youth are four time more likely to receive an adult sentence for the same crime as white children,” Ross said. “African American youth are nine times more likely.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and communication double major Alexis Lin, who took an art class with Ross last Spring quarter, said it is a glaring issue that the majority of the incarcerated are of color.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of youth get stereotyped into certain categories and that’s something that needs to be acknowledged,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>Ross said he often thought of the difference between his own children’s upbringing and that of incarcerated youth while visiting detention centers.</p>\n<p>“Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community,” Ross said. “These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Hector Sanchez Castaneda said he also thought of his family when he learned about the living conditions of incarcerated youth in America.</p>\n<p>“When I saw the pictures downstairs, on the first floor of the library, when I saw the little girl — she’s my sister’s age, eight-years-old,” Sanchez-Castaneda said. “It broke my heart to see a little girl like that with no family whatsoever to support her.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60469\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60469\" data-attachment-id=\"60469\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1065%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1065,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984014\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"170\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60469\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-682x1024.jpg?resize=270%2C405\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"270\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?w=1065&amp;ssl=1 1065w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art professor and photographer Richard Ross. <i>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to Ross, communities are better off when detention centers are closed and resources are invested elsewhere in the community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been closing down a lot of these mass incarceration institutes, especially for kids,” Ross said. “We’ve turned a corner and crime hasn’t gone up . . . the data proves that the more you release kids and give resources to the community, the better the outcomes for kids and communities remain safe.”</p>\n<p>Ross said there are still significant changes that need to be made in the juvenile justice system and hopes his photos will play a part in communicating the need for reform.</p>\n<p>“What’s the common visual vocabulary: that if somebody sees a picture, you think about it,” Ross said. “I want to create that.

During their open forum Saifuddin and Oved explained the student regent application process and discussed the responsibilities that accompany the position in order to reach out to a more diverse pool of applicants for the 2016-17 Student Regent application. Issues facing UC students were also discussed, including mental health, food security and the recently approved tuition increase plan.</p>\n<p>Saifuddin said the main issue facing UC students today, which she has focused on extensively during her term as a regent, is food security. According to Saifuddin, she is looking to address issues of food inaccessibility for students on campuses in which food prices tend to be high.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a problem that students have to make a decision between books and food,” Saifuddin said. “Students should never have to skip a meal. I’m working on creating a system-wide food security model that still has the flexibility for each of the campuses to adapt for their own culture and their own needs, but has some kind of coordinated response so that students don’t go hungry.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik, who attended the forum to learn about how students can mobilize to support student regents, Saifuddin and Oved are using a different recruitment approach this year, meeting with students across the system in an open forum, as well as forums specifically for African American, Asian Pacific American, Chicano/Latino, American Indian/Native American, Middle Eastern and undocumented student minority groups.</p>\n<p>“They are looking for a very diverse group of applicants this year and that’s the exact reason why they’re doing this tour … to talk with students that are on the ground, students that perhaps have not understood what this position entails and to get them interested,” Abdalmalik said. “I think that they have done a very good job of doing so, especially when talking to students that are normally underrepresented such as Middle Eastern students, undocumented students.”</p>\n<p>During the forum, Saifuddin said her experience as the only member of the Board of Regents outside of ex-officio members to vote “no” on the proposed tuition increase was difficult but necessary.</p>\n<p>“You’re kinda backed up against the wall when you’re a student regent,” Saifuddin said. “Students don’t need another tuition increase. It really puts a crunch on middle class students and our campuses really have a big chunk of middle class students.”</p>\n<p>According to Saifuddin, students from an upper-income level family could likely handle an increase of $600, which is approximately what the tuition increase would be annually, but that it puts unnecessary pressure on middle-income students.</p>\n<p>“It seems kinda affordable, but for middle-class students that’s like one month of rent and that’s a lot of hours of work,” Saifuddin said. “Work-study jobs do not make that much. It’s very rare to find a work study job that makes over $15 an hour, and that’s on the high end. It was kind of personal for me because I had gone through a tuition increase and I had to work. I felt that craziness, and really depression.”</p>\n<p>Saifuddin also said she is concerned by what she perceives as continued divestment in the UC by the state over the last 10 to 20 years.</p>\n<p>“The state is slowly dwindling the funds and increasing the budget for things like the Rainy Day Fund that the governor put another like $1.2 billion dollars into in the recent budgets, or prisons, which are really big, actually one of the things at the top,” Saifuddin said. “But when you work with students so intimately you understand what their personal struggle is and I just can’t support that.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Oved is currently working on addressing safety on UC campuses, an issue he said he tackled while working in student government at UCLA and will continue to focus on when he becomes the official Student Regent in July of this year.</p>\n<p>“One thing that we did is develop a mobile panic button safety application,” Oved said. “It was an idea I got from the UC [blue light] phone booths, but those aren’t practical. What we wanted to do was heighten safety resources at UCLA and make it more relevant so students are more equipped with resources. So in the event of an emergency they would be able to respond.”</p>\n<p>According to Oved, the mobile safety application was created in partnership with Circle of 6, a free app that aims to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. The application, according to Oved, “centralizes” emergency communication efforts with six friends that become informed of a person’s location via GPS if they press a button indicating they need help.</p>\n<p>Oved said the application also centralizes safety information with campus resources like Community Service Organization (CSO) and Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE).</p>\n<p>“It’s these resources that I was told by multiple students, ‘I wish I had that, that night, when I really needed it,’ ” Oved said. “I think it’s a really valuable tool and really starts the conversation about safety awareness as well. It also falls under the umbrella of [the UC] President’s task force on responding to and protecting students from sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>According to Saifuddin, the Board of Regents is also discussing how to address student mental health issues and how to make counseling and other resources more available to students struggling with mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“Right now students make appointments for mental health counselors or psychologists and what ends up happening is they have to wait four, or five or six weeks, and then it’s finals time and it’s like, ‘Okay well, good job, nothing happened, we weren’t able to help students,’ ” Saifuddin said. “Every year there is a suicide on campus, so it’s really, really critical that we deal with this problem.”</p>\n<p>Oved also said working one-on-one with UC President Janet Napolitano can be refreshing, because unlike some members of the Board of Regents she is very candid when communicating with Oved and Saifuddin.</p>\n<p>“When we have meeting with her she doesn’t sugar coat her answers,” Oved said. “She is very straight forward. ‘Yes I agree and we’ll support this’ or ‘No I don’t agree and this is why.’ ”</p>\n<p>According to Oved however, the Board’s straight-forward way of communicating can also be “frustrating.”</p>\n<p>“Oftentimes that’s also a really frustrating thing in the student regent position is that you want to do so well and to advocate and to make a dent in your term,” Oved said, “but oftentimes there are people within the democracy who don’t really necessarily want to jump on board with you.”</p>\n<p>Second year biopsychology major Niki Elyasi said she thought the student regents did a “fantastic job” during the forums and are commendable for reaching out to more students in order to allow for a more diverse student regent applicant pool.</p>\n<p>“Bringing people who haven’t been involved in student government, [like] undocumented students [and] Middle Eastern students — I think that is just really, really great,” Elyasi said. “I give them huge kudos for spearheading that and for taking so much time out of what they do to just to reach out to people and make them see that this is something that you can actually do.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59693\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59693\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/","id":2948,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2947,2946,2945],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Das Williams Introduces I.V.

The bill was authored by Williams, who grew up in I.V., an unincorporated area with 20,000 residents situated on less than one square mile.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill would be building off previously passed legislation that established I.V. as a CSD over 30 years ago and would provide more specificity as to the structure and operation of I.V. as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“We would have to spell it out more than that previous legislation did,” Williams said. “I think that it is in the interests of the people of Isla Vista … as well as the state of California … that provides balance.”</p>\n<p>In 1972, when the legislature authorized the establishment of the Isla Vista College Community Services District (IVCCSD), the resulting proposal establishing I.V. as a CSD went before the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which did not approve the authorization.</p>\n<p>Williams said having the legislature act to establish a CSD would provide more flexibility than the LAFCO process.</p>\n<p>“State legislation, unlike the LAFCO process, provides great latitude in spelling out the specific powers of the community services district,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said that if the bill passes, and is approved by the Senate and Governor Jerry Brown, a CSD could be established in I.V. with minimal input from LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“We could include some participation from LAFCO in the process,” Williams said. “However LAFCO is bound to only … approve or disprove a five member board that are all directly elected.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams’ office, the CSD would have the power to facilitate infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security and roads. The bill, however, does not specify how these community services will be funded, although Williams’ office has stated CSDs are commonly funded by revenue bonds or special taxes.</p>\n<p>Williams said the specifics of the CSD’s revenue will be determined through continued community dialogue.</p>\n<p>“There are many ideas for revenue, some are less controversial than others, and that is why we really need a stakeholder process to really talk about what is the right revenue sources for a community services district,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said he thinks a CSD will be more successful than previous attempts at self-governance.</p>\n<p>“We as a community can make that change but we shouldn’t be so naive as to think that we can do it . . . with what we have because what we have had before is not working,” Williams said. “When we had a municipal advisory committee before it did not work. Governance by the county alone, without the resources to do things particularly for I.V., has not worked.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the university supporting the creation of self-governance in I.V. is a positive sign and a key difference to note when comparing previous attempts at self-governance for I.V.</p>\n<p>“One thing that is really important that has changed since the previous attempts at local governance in I.V. is that the university, which was once an impediment to local governance in Isla Vista., is as an institution now arguing for local governance,” Williams said. “That is a change that everyone should have some hope in and it means that the aspirations of Isla Vista as a community may be able to be reached.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the establishment of some form of local governance must address the needs of the variety of residents in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Any local governance should provide a balance between the different residents of Isla Vista.,” Williams said. “Both what you could call the lower income ethnic communities of Isla Vista, the student population and the resident population concentrated out of the west end — there needs to be a balance between the interests of all of those parties.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, he and his staff will be asking for public comments from I.V. residents over the next two months to determine the specifics of the bill and said it is his “intention to continue the community dialogue that has already been taking place.”</p>\n<p>“We will be asking for input as to what powers will be included in this community services district and how many seats there are, what their terms are, that sort of thing,” Williams said. “The legislation … would continue how it is with the added detail that can only happen after we receive more comprehensive and more specific public comment.”</p>\n<p>Williams said that given the events that have occurred in I.V. in the last year, the time to act is now.</p>\n<p>“There is plenty of time for further public input and for the stakeholder process,” Williams said. “But that given, the amount of human pain that has been experienced in Isla Vista in the last year, I felt that action was necessary and that we needed to begin this process and begin it now.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

As a student, your interests are at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats vice president of events and fourth-year geology major Sam Goldman said although the university’s position as the number one university for voter registration is commendable, the achievement can be misleading.</p>\n<p>“You want to make sure that voter registration turns into actual voting,” Goldman said. “It is obviously really awesome, and it does reflect a campus that is active and concerned with what’s going on around us. But hopefully the momentum from this event will get people excited and will carry over to election day.”<br>\nCapps said that students have a significant impact on the outcome of her race.</p>\n<p>“It’s a concentration of votes that I appreciate for my race because this race is really a tough one and so it might give me the margin of victory,” Capps said. “My husband won a congressional seat and he won by the margin of the number of students who voted in Isla Vista and at UCSB. I always try to share that with students about the importance of student votes.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, students play a large role in deciding whether or not future cyclic steam injection, acidizing or fracking will occur in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara is regarded in many places as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and that is an important legacy,” Williams said. “We had hundreds of applications in the last year [for drilling new wells] and many would be with the most dangerous, the most water intensive and the highest carbon emissions of techniques that are out there.”</p>\n<p>According to Campus Democrats President and fourth-year chemistry major Krishna Hammond, as election day grows closer Campus Democrats will continue to promote the importance of voting to students and Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>For the “I’ve got a big clock counting down in my head ‘til election day,” Hammond said. “We’re going to be knocking on doors, calling people, going around the neighborhood, waving signs at people; basically everything you possibly can to get people to come out.”</p>\n<p>Newsom said he believes Campus Democrats’ efforts are important to help “reconcile the apathy that exists with young folks in the electoral process at all levels.”</p>\n<p>“We have an obligation to be active citizens,” Newsom said. “Young folks have the capacity to amplify their voices in a way that is unique in this generation. There are a lot of young folks that have the absolute ability to change things radically, but only if they exercise their voice and are more participatory in the life of their campus.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, October 30, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57648\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/prominent-politicians-visit-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57648\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/prominent-politicians-visit-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/prominent-politicians-visit-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/prominent-politicians-visit-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/prominent-politicians-visit-campus/","id":2990,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2989,2988,2987],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Alum Helps Restore Ranch House","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Monday, the university announced that alumna Linda Duttenhaver donated $2 million towards the restoration of a 1950s ranch house on Sedgwick Reserve which accommodates affiliated researchers from h...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57282\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57282\" data-attachment-id=\"57282\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/field_stations_0/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/field_stations_0.jpg?fit=1275%2C825&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1275,825\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"field_stations_0\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/field_stations_0.jpg?fit=250%2C162&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/field_stations_0.jpg?fit=888%2C575&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57282\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/field_stations_0-1024x662.jpg?resize=500%2C324\" alt=\"This map shows the approximate layout of buildings on the Sedgwick reserve property.

Map courtesy of <em>sedgwick.nrs.ucsb.edu</em></p></div>\n<p>On Monday, the university announced that alumna Linda Duttenhaver donated $2 million towards the restoration of a 1950s ranch house on Sedgwick Reserve which accommodates affiliated researchers from half of the approximately 40 projects on the reserve.</p>\n<p>The donation will go towards bringing the Sedgwick ranch house up-to-date with fire and building codes, followed by renovating the facility to make it more comfortable and functional for residents. The Sedgwick Reserve is located 40 miles north of campus in the Santa Ynez Valley and is one of seven reserves managed by the university’s Natural Reserve System (NRS), a branch of the greater UC Natural Reserve System which oversees 39 reserves in total throughout the state.</p>\n<p>According to Sedgwick Reserve Resident Director Kate McCurdy, the money may be used to update specific parts of the house.</p>\n<p>“We hope to modernize the really funky old 1950s kitchen, to make it useful for people to cook,” McCurdy said. “Right now the house is set up in a dorm style with lots of bunk beds so we’re also going to replace the bunk beds with double beds.”</p>\n<p>Patricia Holden, professor of environmental microbiology in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management and director of the Natural Reserve System, said the mission of the UC NRS is to “support broadly university level research, education and public outreach.”</p>\n<p>According to Holden, all UC NRS projects are “approached with the lens of sustainability,” and make energy and water conservation an important criteria throughout the design process.</p>\n<p>“We currently produce our own energy here with solar panels,” McCurdy said. “Now we want to replace the windows and possibly do rainwater capture off the roof, and also replace the heating system so it is more energy efficient.”</p>\n<p>McCurdy said Duttenhaver is “one of those rare gem alumni,” who has made significant contributions to Sedgwick Reserve over the last few years.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important to her to see students use what they’re learning in the classroom out in the field,” McCurdy said. “She definitely recognizes that having a decent place to stay when you’re out on the edge of wilderness is very important. For students and faculty to really be inspired by the place they’re working at, they need to be comfortable and safe.”</p>\n<p>McCurdy also said some of Duttenhaver’s past donations have aided the renovation of the ranch’s historic barn, as well as the development of an outreach program.</p>\n<p>“That barn was so close to falling over and it was pretty scary to be in there on a windy day because you could see the whole thing moving,” McCurdy said. “So she really did save that from the brink of collapse. Then our outreach program allows us to have public hikes and a lecture series. So without her help it would be pretty quiet out here.”</p>\n<p>NRS Business Officer Donna Moore said the NRS provides researchers and students a protected environment for their studies.</p>\n<p>“Researchers can come and set up an experiment or classes can come and get involved in a project and they know that it won’t be disturbed,” said Moore. “It also protects the area, keeping them as restored to their original condition as they could possibly be, and gives researchers a place to stay and keep their equipment.”</p>\n<p>Various research efforts are pursued at the reserve within fields including botany, archaeology, microbiology and geology. According to McCurdy, native plants and animals thrive in an undisturbed habitat. Additionally, a telescope is also being used at the Sedgwick Reserve by the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Network, a nonprofit network of robotic telescopes used for science and education.</p>\n<p>“We are sort of at the southern end of the Transverse Range and we have a unique soil type that is high in turpentine that invasive plants don’t do very well in, so we have a lot of native plants that aren’t found elsewhere,” McCurdy said.</p>\n<p>McCurdy also said a grant has been submitted to gain funding for the construction of a 24-bed dormitory adjacent to the ranch house, with a groundbreaking set for 2016.</p>\n<p>“Classes will then be able to use the dorm and researchers and people who are staying longer will be able to use the ranch house,” McCurdy said.</p>\n<p>According to McCurdy, Sedgwick Reserve is “a little national park” and a place where “you will never know what you’re going to encounter.” McCurdy also said the reserve offers visitors many surprises and a natural habitat worth protecting.</p>\n<p>“What amazes me about this property is how enormous and rich it is,” McCurdy said. “You can see deer and bears and eagles, or you may see animal tracks or a freshly killed deer that a mountain lion just killed. So there’s evidence of just how biologically important this place is. This really is the perfect place to have a reserve.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57255\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57255\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/ucsb-alum-helps-restore-ranch-house/","id":2981,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2980,2979,2978],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/96"}},"__N_SSG":true}
