My eyes jumped to the blue lights on the stage and quickly skimmed the rows for an open seat.</p>\n<p>The lecture hall quickly reached max capacity, and people were redirected to Buchanan to watch a live stream of the lecture done by Bryan Stevenson, an extremely influential and inspirational lawyer who spends his life working to bring justice to those least likely to receive it. He founded the Equal Justice Initiative to defend the poor and has spent a lot of time working with clients on death row. He is also the author of <em>Just Mercy</em>, this year’s UCSB Reads book.</p>\n<p>The excitement and anticipation in the air were tangible, much louder in presence than the jazz music playing as people filed into their seats.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Stevenson’s signature quote, “The opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice,” was scrawled across the lecture screen next to a picture of a shattered blue ceramic mockingbird. The University librarian spoke, and then came the moment everyone was waiting for: Bryan Stevenson came out on stage.</p>\n<p>Stevenson said he wanted to talk about how he thinks we can change the world. He went on to explain the current prison and incarceration statistics, finishing with the daunting statistic that said one in three black baby boys born in the U.S. would go to jail in his lifetime.</p>\n<p>The first thing he said we could do to change the world is get proximate to poverty in the community. He said that you cannot change the world from a distance, and only in proximity will you find power.</p>\n<p>As Stevenson’s speech grew more fervent with emotion, the crowd responded more enthusiastically and dramatically to his remarks. People called out praise to him and were in agreement with his words.</p>\n<p>The next thing he said that we could do to change the world is change the narratives. He argued that we need to change these narratives in order to change the problems that they cause. He said we especially need to change the narrative of racism in this country. We need to confront the fact that our history is rooted in genocide and do what we must as a country to heal from that.</p>\n<p>He made a dramatic claim that as the Germans had marked the locations of the Holocaust in respect, we should mark the spots of lynching in this country so the ghosts of racism are visible to us.</p>\n<p>The third thing he said we could do to change the world is be hopeful. Hope is essential to change the world. Losing hope is what condemns us to remain where we are.</p>\n<p>Fourth and finally, he said we must be willing to do uncomfortable things. Many times his job has put him in pain or made him uncomfortable, but he persevered. He has realized that the reason why he does what he does it because he is a broken person; he works for broken people, and yet he is broken himself. Sometimes being broken gives us the edge we need to fight back.</p>\n<p>He finished off his inspiring speech by saying that we should never doubt our capacity to change the world; neither our grades nor our income represent a measure of our capacity to bring about change. Our capacity to change the world is measured by our willingness to do the things that have to be done.</p>\n<p>Many people stood to ask him questions. A student spoke of how he was moved to tears more by Bryan Stevenson than by the death of his family; people stood to talk of their hardships or to question the hypocrisy of the UC system in working with Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p>When he finished speaking, there was an awe-filled moment of silence before the massive crowd rose as one in a thunderous standing ovation.</p>\n<div

classes to immerse themselves in creative alternatives.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind the hiatus is Laurel Beckman, professor of art, who says the event is intended to create a “communal environment” within the art department. Alaia/Paipo surfboard making, silk scarf dyeing and a trip to the Getty Center Museum in L.A. are among the activities planned this week to replace the regular humdrum of university life.</p>\n<p>Beckman said the idea for the interlude came together quickly because of cooperation from faculty and students. Students are “agents of their own interests,” Beckman said, explaining that they will be leading several of the week’s activities.</p>\n<p>“One of the really important parts of the interlude is that everybody’s participating: students, staff, faculty, grad students, undergrads, everybody,” Beckman said. “Other than classes and working by yourself in the studio, we don’t have a lot of community activities, and I wanted to do [an interlude] so people could choose … what they participated in.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69768\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69768\" data-attachment-id=\"69768\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-arts-department-takes-interlude-to-build-community-expand-creativity/arts-building-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Arts Building\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69768\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69768\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Kip Fulbeck, professor of art, said recently that students had not been producing with the same “drive and fervor” that he is used to, and the arts faculty had also become complacent.</p>\n<p>“We were becoming stagnant and needed to shake things up,” Fulbeck said in an email. “I’m hoping to re-ignite our creative drives, excitement, passion for making art and experiencing life. You learn more outside the classroom than in it.”</p>\n<p>Graduate students found out about the interlude late last quarter and were highly encouraged to direct activities or to create ideas for alternative classes.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Rose Briccetti, who has organized a butterfly pinning event, said the interlude will be an interesting outlet for creativity.</p>\n<p>“[The interlude] seemed like a fun kind of unique way to get people thinking about art outside the confines of just painting or printmaking or sculpture or the materials and ways of making we kind of generally adhere to,” Briccetti said.</p>\n<p>According to graduate student Emily Baker, the arts department is lacking a critical element of preparation for a career in arts: a tight-knit community. Baker said she pushes students to go to art events every quarter so they can talk about their work and have contacts to “bounce ideas off of.”</p>\n<p>“As an artist, networking is my work. It’s my job, you know? Like the whole ‘wine and cheese’ art event thing, that’s work,” Baker said. “And I did feel that lack of community in the arts department … so I think this will help perpetuate that community a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>Students and professors alike are unsure at the moment whether they will carry the interlude into the future, but at least a few, like Briccetti, are very interested in seeing it continue as a department tradition.
