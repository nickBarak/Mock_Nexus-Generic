During a goat yoga class, goats interact with participants by jumping on participants’ backs or snuggling on the yoga mat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goat yoga class in I.V. will be held at the Santa Barbara Hillel this upcoming Saturday, Dec. 2, at 11 a.m. A maximum of 50 people are allowed in the class, and the class will cost $40 per participant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eli Bahar, a second-year undeclared major and host of the event, said goat yoga is more beneficial than regular yoga because the interaction with goats releases endorphins, which stimulates a positive feeling in the body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It connects you to the people around you and provides a friendly atmosphere,” Bahar said. “It is more than zen and more of an experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar grew up in Los Angeles and said he discovered goat yoga last August. He was on a waitlist for three months before he could participate because there is only one studio in Los Angeles that offers the unique yoga class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was an amazing experience and a crazy wild adrenaline rush. You are just surrounded by people having a good time,” Bahar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar said he wanted to bring goat yoga to I.V. because UCSB students “stress out and don’t find time for themselves.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar contacted a farm in Sun Valley, Calif. that brings certified goats to yoga events. It is “fairly expensive” to bring this experience to Isla Vista, Bahar said, but he expects a good turnout at the class.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat yoga was created by Lainey Morse, a goat owner from Albany, Oreg. Morse was encouraged by a local yoga instructor to connect her love of goats with the practice of yoga. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat yoga is animal-assisted therapy, according to Morse’s </span><a href=\"https://goatyoga.net/about/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and is an “unbelievable distraction” from work, politics or sickness.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not Bahar’s first time helping students destress before finals. He also started a business called Party Ice which delivers ice cream sandwiches to residents in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall the week before midterms and finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Goat yoga is a step above Party Ice and is still a way to help people destress,” Bahar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those interested in signing up for goat yoga can email Bahar at </span><em><a href=\"mailto:ivgoatyoga@gmail.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ivgoatyoga@gmail.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Users also have the option to attach a large umbrella to the back of the chair.</p>\n<p>Beachgoers can access the chair free of charge at the Adventure Program’s Campus Point Rentals center or through the Rec Cen.</p>\n<p>Cathy Czuleger, senior associate director for programming, information technology and development for the Department of Recreation, said the Rec Cen first purchased the beach wheelchair with funding from the Adapted Recreation Program 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>The Adapted Recreation Program is a Santa Barbara organization that provides outdoor services to community members with special needs.</p>\n<p>She said when the program ended, the wheelchair became “rusty and unusable” so the Rec Cen contacted CF to fund a new chair.</p>\n<p>The Rec Cen proposed the project to CF and applied for funding during winter 2016, said Peter Min, outreach coordinator for CF.</p>\n<p>“The program ended, and the wheelchair was not maintained or easily available for use during the past 10 years,” Min said.</p>\n<p>Czuleger said she decided to write a proposal to CF requesting money to purchase a new chair and said she was happy with the organization’s “generous” funding allocation.</p>\n<p>According to Min, CF accepts proposals for research, projects and internships every quarter and critically reviews them to see if they are compatible with the organization’s mission statement, the student community and their goal to preserve the shoreline and marine life.</p>\n<p>CF receives funds from all UCSB students through a lock-in student fee every quarter. Each undergraduate student contributes $5.75 per quarter and each graduate student contributes $3.00 per quarter.</p>\n<p>CF provides over $350,000 each year to preserve UCSB’s beaches and has distributed over $3 million locally since the fall of 1999.</p>\n<p>If students wish to earn funding for their own group or organization, they can participate in CF’s restoration projects and beach clean-ups.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The current psychology and brain sciences faculty are experts in the biological side of psychology, so the university won’t need to hire new professors.</p>\n<p>Some first-year students, however, are wary of the changes.</p>\n<p>Kellie Stahlhuth, a first-year undeclared major, said she planned to get a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology at UCSB and pursue a career in psychology after graduation, but is now unsure if the offered Bachelor of Science degree is the best way to achieve her goals.</p>\n<p>“The other UC campuses and most other universities in California still have a psychology B.A., in addition to the fact that it was a popular degree [at UCSB],” she said.</p>\n<p>However, Carly Wilcox, a fourth-year psychology major, said as she nears the end of her time at UCSB, she would have appreciated a Bachelor of Science degree to diversify her classes.</p>\n<p>“I would have liked the B.S. when I was an incoming freshman personally… but it might be nice if the department offered both,” Wilcox said. “I took Statistics and Math 34A, but other than that the classes for my major have been strictly psych classes.”</p>\n<p>When the old degree was still in effect, the department received approximately 300 applications per year from incoming freshmen seeking a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology.</p>\n<p>This past fall, there were approximately 200 freshman applicants to the new Bachelor of Science degree.</p>\n<p>Mackie recommends all psychology majors, even those who may not be as S.T.E.M.-oriented as others, to still pursue the Bachelor of Science degree because they will receive a more well-rounded psychology education.</p>\n<p>Mackie said students planning on pursuing a career in clinical psychology are given the education they need, while also benefiting students seeking work in medical and research fields.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/","id":2744,"author":{"id":177,"name":"Kayla Larson"},"related":[2743,2742,2741],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/177"}},"__N_SSG":true}
