He graduated from UCSB last year with a degree in history.</p>\n<p>At his Tuesday showing, which marked a year since he took over as the Trivia Night host, it was clear King’s evenhandedness has earned him respect — and even admiration.</p>\n<p>One team name on Tuesday was, “Robbie is a Tender Lover.” Another dubbed itself, “Leave Robbie Alone!”</p>\n<p>“People won’t believe that I’ll actually say that over the microphone,” King laughed.</p>\n<p>Unlike I.V.’s other evening draws, like the discounted premium beer at Woodstock’s Wednesday pint nights, Trivia Night gives Isla Vistans something to do. There are endless pitchers of beer sold during the event, but the evening’s lure isn’t rooted in drinking alcohol for its own sake.</p>\n<p>There’s also no politeness among strangers here; adjacent booths become fast enemies and tables break into conspiratorial huddles.</p>\n<p>“It’s a part of I.V. culture that isn’t just drinking,” King said. “Sure, there’s plenty of drinking, but it’s all about interactions people are having. It’s competition — friendly, most of the time. I really love doing it because I have a good energy about it and people come in here with a good energy about it.”</p>\n<p>Themed events generate the biggest crowds. One night saw all of the questions styled around the television series “The Office.” So many showed up that some groups scurried onto the floor while participants leaned in over the patio rail. Another five-week derby went, decade by decade, from the 1960s through the 2000s. I.V. packed the house, even during UCSB’s Dead Week.</p>\n<p>But the bare-bones, general-knowledge questions are the real challenge, especially when King reaches for topics just out of the average attendee’s grasp.</p>\n<p>One of his favorite questions from the event’s history? “What do you call a female sheep?’” he said. The subject seems banal, but the answer would elude many: an “ewe.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of people thought they should know that but didn’t, so I got like several, ‘This question sucks,’ ‘Fuck this question,’ ‘I can’t believe you asked this,’” King recalled. “I didn’t realize the ewes generate so much controversy.”</p>\n<p>King deep-dives into Wikipedia each week to come up with a balanced spread of head-scratchers. What drew him toward the event as a freshman, he said, was the element of “mental prowess.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a funny sort of knowledge, really,” he said. “I get like a lot of little tiny details about things.”</p>\n<p>In a year of running the show, King has absorbed his fair share of trivia. In fact, he can now tell you which team appeared in the most Super Bowls during the 1990s.</p>\n<p>“How useful is that? I don’t know, but now I have that filed away.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.6 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

Shut it down!” <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recently elected 69th A.S. Senate abruptly ended its inaugural meeting after a group of about 60 people stormed the Hub screaming, “Shut it down!” in what the group called an act of “civil disobedience.” The students stomped onto the stage and grabbed microphones away from the sitting senators, who had hastily begun their meeting when 11 senators and Internal Vice President-Elect Steven Ho failed to show up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In similar fashion, 15 senators and proxies didn’t show up to the final 68th Senate meeting earlier that evening. Those who boycotted the meeting did so in an apparent protest of the 12 who </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">didn’t return to last week’s meeting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the dust settled, it was another instance — the fifth time in six years — in which divestment failed to pass at UC Santa Barbara, which remains the only undergraduate UC campus not to have passed the resolution.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The divestment resolution calls for the UC to withdraw investments from companies that profit from alleged human rights violations in Israel and Palestine. While proponents cite violence in the region as a reason to divest, opponents, largely from the Jewish community, believe the resolution singles out Israel and draws its contents from the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which they deem to be anti-Semitic.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wednesday evening was intended to include both the final meeting of the 68th Senate and the first session of the 69th, along with the swearing-in of the elected A.S. executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final meeting of the 68th was supposed to pick up right where it left off — at the conclusion of last week’s meeting, where 12 senators and proxies didn’t return from a recess because the other 13 wouldn’t approve the agenda. The Senate was split over how to categorize the resolution, a distinction that would have significantly altered the necessary voting threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to accept the agenda, to discuss this issue,” said Off-Campus Senator Kristen Armellini. “To say that we didn’t want to discuss it is false.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83282\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83282\" data-attachment-id=\"83282\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/judicial-council-seats-will-be-unfilled-until-at-least-week-9/img_3217/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3217\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83282 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83282\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Outgoing A.S.

The senators rapidly chose Mordi Shadpour to be the first pro-tempore and Lea Toubian as the second pro-tempore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the only reason why they were chosen is because… they were the only two people that applied for that position that were the senators that were sitting there,” said Off-Campus Senator Carla Cernat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shadpour and Toubian then took the lead, directing the 69th Senate as they ratified the 2018 A.S. Elections results and approved Ali Suebert, the current A.S. attorney general, to serve another year-long term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Shadpour attempted to lead the meeting, outgoing A.S. representatives, including IVP Sandhu, stood in front of the stage, mouthing directions to the new senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incoming A.S. President Brooke Kopel was the only executive candidate to be sworn in after elections results were ratified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho found out through a text message from fellow Senator Andrea Reyes that the 69th senate had appointed pro-tempores in his absence, according to his statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This angered me because I chose my pro-temps based who I see would work best with me and be the best assets to the office and will help me fulfill my role as the presiding officer of senate,” he wrote. “I was literally sitting in the corner trying to breath while all of this was happening. I think it was really disrespectful for the senate to do all of that and take advantage of the state I was in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho stood in the Hub as the 11 senators absent at the start of the meeting walked in at approximately 8:40 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sandhu, outgoing senators Sophia Dycaico and Grayson Hernandez and outgoing Student Advocate General Jack Tannenbaum could be seen urging the 69th Senate to speed up the process of passing the motions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once all the senators were seated, Marquez took to the microphone to request that the senators who were already sworn in call for a recess to allow their peers to be officially sworn in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the senators could consider the motion, chants of “Shut it down!

after 12 senators left — and never came back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The controversial “divestment” resolution was brought to the table for the fifth time in six years on

of the resolution, one that would have altered the number of “yes” votes needed for the resolution to pass. Following a prolonged standoff that divided the Senate nearly in half, the meeting abruptly ended just after 5:00 a.m., when Internal Vice President (IVP) Jasmine Sandhu announced that there were no longer enough senators to vote on the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our constituents were still here when people decided to leave,” Senator Grecia Martinez told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the meeting. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83178\" style=\"width: 682px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83178\" data-attachment-id=\"83178\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/divestment3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?fit=672%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"672,480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"divestment3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?fit=672%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83178 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?resize=672%2C480\" alt=\"\" width=\"672\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?w=672&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83178\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some of the senators sent proxies, or substitutes, to attend Wednesday’s meeting. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution calls on UC Santa Barbara, the A.S. Investment Advisory Committee, the UC Treasury and the UC Regents to withdraw investments from companies “that provide military support to the occupation of Palestinian territories.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in companies like General Electric, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which sell military equipment to Israel, shows “implicit support” for the killing of Palestinian civilians, the resolution states.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eighty-nine speakers took the podium at public forum on Wednesday, the vast majority of them speaking about the issue of divestment and the Israel-Palestine conflict at large. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the Senate never got to an actual discussion about the conflict. Instead, the senators fell into a disagreement after Ali Suebert, the A.S. attorney general, told the Senate at public forum that the resolution would be a “positional” and not “directional” piece of legislation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positional resolution “endorses, sponsors, or supports a group’s actions or events,” according to A.S. Legal Code. Typically, the Senate uses these resolutions to adopt an official stance on an issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A directional resolution, meanwhile, “directs members of A.S. Personnel, Boards, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committees, and/or the Senate to specific duties” and usually moves to create an actual effect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suebert pointed to individual parts of the resolution’s language, including a phrase about companies “profiting from human rights violations,” to justify her judgment that the resolution called for adopting a position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key difference between the two comes down to voting thresholds. While a positional resolution needs a two-thirds majority to pass, a directional resolution needs only a 50 percent plus one vote majority to be approved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That margin mattered to the divestment vote. Throughout the night, various votes to move the meeting forward stalled at 13-12. As a result, the Senate wound up discussing only the nature of the resolution itself and not its contents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, 13 senators did not want to approve the agenda, which would have codified the resolution as positional. Seeing that they wouldn’t budge, the other 12 senators did not come back from a recess, which forced an early end to the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Brandon Mora and Vanessa Maldonado co-authored the resolution, and students Naia Al-Anbar and Edan Tessema co-sponsored it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was intended to be directional, Maldonado said at the meeting. She emphasized she and Mora did not want the Senate to assume a position on the political or moral issue at the core of divestment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copies of the resolution provided by A.S. at the meeting stated that the resolution was directional. Sandhu, who chairs the Senate and has the authority to adjust resolutions, later changed it to be positional. Suebert, the A.S. attorney general, deemed it both directional and positional when she spoke at public forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution will now be pushed either to next week’s meeting, an emergency meeting or an email vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Alexandra Gessesse and third-year global studies major Justice Dumlao, who substituted for Sophia Uemura, cited language used in past directional resolutions, such as a resolution to support last week’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/afscme-strike-comes-to-an-end-a-s-passes-resolution-in-support/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as having set a precedent for how directional resolutions should be written. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, you see the senators that came back to the table willing to have the conversation that was necessary to make sure the authors got due diligence, that the communities got due diligence and both sides on UCSB’s campus and all students involved got due diligence,” Gessesse told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gessesse added that she felt the walkout disrespected Sandhu as the Senate chair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was disappointing to see people who I would think are committed to this campus, especially in terms of their commitments next year, to not be committed to working through student issues when I’m obviously committed to working on these student issues,” Dumlao said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators who were approached for comment after walking out of the meeting asked to be contacted later in the day on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Mineiro, Sanya Kamidi and Maura Fox contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of the graphic in this story listed Adnan Mansur as Sami Kaayal’s proxy.

will open in the near future. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">212F Hotpot, which for months has sported a storefront sign at 6533 Trigo Road, will open by the end of May at the latest, owner David Chen told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The restaurant will be the first personal hot pot restaurant in the area. While the cuisine is Chinese, the theme is not to be confused with regular Chinese hot pot, which provides patrons with a family-style pot at the middle of the table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, 212F Hotpot will give each restaurant-goer a personal pot of boiling soup, so customers can dine individually. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the menu items will be soup-based – broths of beef, seafood and the like will be available to order in a semi-sit-down format. Chen is toying with the idea of takeout, but the idea is to give I.V. residents a spot to sit down and enjoy their dinner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen hasn’t decided the restaurant’s hours of operation. After opening, it will stay open until 10 or 11 p.m., but he might decide to close earlier or later depending on the restaurant’s initial popularity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If customers want to come, we’ll serve them any time,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be Chen’s third eatery in the area. He also owns PokeMee, a poke restaurant, and Choppa Rollin’ Ice Cream, a Thai rolled ice cream store, both of which are found on Hollister Avenue in Goleta. The two shops offer niche products in an area mostly bereft of non-generic Asian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen will change the name of PokeMee to Choppa Poke in the near future, due to a name dispute with a poke restaurant in Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal hot pot will provide a “whole new concept” of hot pot cuisine to the community, Chen highlighted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many restaurants in I.V. are staples, some close down quickly after opening. A number of joints have shut down shop in the past few years, including Otaco, El Sitio, La Cantina, Santa Ynez Burrito and Kol’s Cafe — the last of which is the predecessor to 212F Hotpot’s location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the problem is the food itself, some is the type of food,” Chen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re hoping to be a staple,” added manager Will Groman, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara just last quarter. Groman worked at PokeMee before Chen hired him to be a part of 212F Hotpot from the ground up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In I.V. there aren’t many places where you can sit down for 30 minutes,” Groman said. “You order and take it to go home. It’d be nice to have an atmosphere where people can come, sit down and be lively.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chen moved to Santa Barbara County in 2016 after noticing that the area had no poke restaurants. He used money from his existing e-commerce company to fund the startup costs. Since then, he has launched several restaurants, 212F Hotpot being the third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming months, he said, he plans to open a State Street shop that sells both poke and Thai ice cream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a background in sales, Chen stressed there is no one good way to pitch people on the hot pot joint. Instead, he offered a catch-all line to interested consumers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s new, so come try it out,” he said. </span></p><div

district member” on the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which oversees special districts in the county. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Conflict-of-interest rules state that a public official has a “disqualifying conflict of interest” in a government decision if it is “foreseeable” that the official could be financially impacted by the decision.</p>\n<p>If a public official might be financially affected by a decision, they must recuse themselves from the vote in order to avoid bias, according to the rules, which come from the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC).</p>\n<p>There are exemptions, but none of them appear to apply to Tuesday’s vote, which took place at the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The position Bertrand is running for is the “alternate special district member” on the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which oversees special districts in the county.</p>\n<p>As people move into cities, the LAFCO makes sure spaces remain open and resources are protected. An alternate member takes part in LAFCO affairs when the regular members cannot be present or need to recuse themselves. For each meeting attended, the member makes $150 without benefits.</p>\n<p>Bertrand secured the nomination with four “yes” votes, one “no” vote and two abstentions.</p>\n<p>If Bertrand had not voted for himself and instead abstained, he would not have received the nomination.</p>\n<p>The FPPC didn’t offer a direct opinion on the matter since “only an investigation determines whether violations have occurred.”</p>\n<p>“Generally speaking, the responsibility is on public officials to avoid conflicts,” Jay Wierenga, the FPPC communications director, said in an email. He went on to say officials are recommended by law to avoid “even the appearance” of conflicts.</p>\n<p>David Seymour, another nominee for the LAFCO position, did recuse himself when his special district, the Santa Ynez CSD, voted to nominate him. Seymour, a 14-year veteran of the Santa Ynez CSD, left the room while the vote took place.</p>\n<p>“I had to leave, I left, I recused myself,” Seymour told the <em>Nexus.</em> “I can’t vote for myself. By going to LAFCO, there’s financial conditions and so you can’t do that. That’s against the law.”</p>\n<p>At Tuesday’s CSD meeting, Bertrand introduced his intent to run for the vacant position on the Santa Barbara LAFCO. While fellow directors Robert Geis and George Thurlow immediately mentioned and seconded a motion to place him in the position, Bertrand faced hesitation from director Jay Freeman.</p>\n<p>Freeman told the board it should throw its support behind Seymour, citing Seymour’s experience in and around LAFCO through the years.</p>\n<p>To that end, Freeman noted LAFCO’s emphasis on nitty gritty aspects of the larger county and said it would look bad if the I.V. CSD nominated someone who hadn’t attended enough LAFCO meetings.</p>\n<p>Going for this position would spread Bertrand too thin, Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“I like that you’re excited to do this, but it seems like a stretch given all you’re doing here,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand defended his qualifications, saying the LAFCO needs more younger folks and people of color in the way of diversity.</p>\n<p>He later told the <em>Nexus</em> that he has attended “quite a few” LAFCO meetings “over the past couple of years.”</p>\n<p>Thurlow stepped in, telling Bertrand to step down from facilitating the discussion since he had a direct interest in the outcome.</p>\n<p>Particularly, Thurlow said Bertrand should recuse himself from running the meeting, but “not necessarily from voting.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Bertrand stood by his decision to vote on the matter.</p>\n<p>“I still believe that what I did was within my rights and responsibilities,” he told the <em>Nexus</em>. “I’m still comfortable with it.”</p>\n<p>He directed the<em> Nexus</em> to the CSD’s legal counsel for further questions. G.

Loudon is running with Campus United and Morales with the Isla Vista Party, both of which push for mostly progressive political ideals.</p>\n<p>The External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) serves as the official Associated Students representative of student engagement at state and national levels. In past years, the EVPSA has been the focal point of organizing student lobbying trips and making statements to the community about local, state and national political issues.</p>\n<p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS:</strong></p>\n<p>Loudon, a second-year history of public policy major, spoke about fighting with state legislators for better higher education funding and mentioned food insecurity as one of her largest concerns. She referred to her experience as the co-chair of Lobby Corps and her time served working as a policy analyst for the current EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>“As someone who’s first worked in politics and focused on legislation, I’ve found the office to be a really easy home to have here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Morales, a fourth-year global studies and Chicanx studies major, spoke to the same ideas, adding that funding for public education should extend to all grade levels and not just the university level. She spoke to her own experience lobbying and her credentials as a lead organizer for the Student Activist Network.</p>\n<p>Morales’ relationships with public officials like Assemblywoman Monique Limón, she said, make her qualified to work with politicians to alleviate problems like student food insecurity. She spent time lobbying for bills, including one that would make it possible for students to receive the Cal Grant during summer sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>FIRST ACTION IN OFFICE:</strong></p>\n<p>Securing “state investment” would be Loudon’s top priority if elected. That doesn’t apply to simply fighting tuition hikes, she said, but rather getting the State of California to invest in all issues affecting students. She mentioned her own connections to local politicians, including State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson of Santa Barbara, as a route to getting UCSB students to the state government’s ear.</p>\n<p>In March, the UC Regents approved a 3.5 percent tuition hike for nonresident students. Morales attended the meeting where the decision was laid down, she said, and was confronted by a police officer while protesting peacefully.</p>\n<p>Loudon noted voter registration as another top priority of hers. She’s worked on getting students from “across the UC system” registered to vote. Strengthening programs like the United States Students Association would be crucial to making sure students stay active and represented in politics, she said.</p>\n<p><strong>ON-CAMPUS EFFORTS:</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>After working personally with the past two EVPSA offices, Loudon said she wants to increase education surrounding mental health — not just regarding the problem itself, but how students can utilize existing resources to improve their own circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of work focused on expanding resources, which is very necessary,” Loudon said. “But I’ve had so many conversations with students on our campus who aren’t aware of existing programs that already benefit them from the federal government.”</p>\n<p>Morales hasn’t worked directly in the EVPSA office, but said she has high praise for it.</p>\n<p>“I fell in love with the EVPSA office two or three years ago when Moshin [Mirza] was in office,” she said. “He was able to incorporate lobbying and organizing tactics into the office.”</p>\n<p>If she’s elected, she said, she would bring those efforts back. In addition, she wants to add an office liaison to communicate with labor workers on campus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

unkind to his residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand, the president of the I.V.

His friend recorded the video, which was shared widely on the internet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">District Attorney Joyce Dudley </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/isla-vista-landlord-charged-with-criminal-complaint-after-yelling-homophobic-slurs-at-csd-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indicted Gelb on a misdemeanor charge of “disturbing the peace”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November.

Gelb was not present in court for the arraignment and has not appeared at any previous hearings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griselda Carreon, associate attorney for Lynn &amp; O’Brien, LLP, argued in court to have the case dismissed, citing reasons that included Gelb’s right to free speech and the notion that the specific offensive language in question had not been specified by the prosecution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prosecutor Carl Barnes noted that other crimes, like battery, do not specify the precise nature of the harm committed. He pointed to the online video as a clear representation of the words used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Superior Court Judge Raimundo Montes De Oca pointed out a line in the California penal code, which states, “offensive words in a public place which are inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction” can be designated as a crime against public peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carreon argued the language was not likely to provoke violence, referring to Bertrand having told police that he had sought to de-escalate the situation and was a person who believed in nonviolence. She also said the video was “unauthenticated” and “may have been clipped.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said Bertrand and “his buddy” had “laughed, smirked and continued to taunt Mr. Gelb.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montes De Oca denied the demurrer, a request to dismiss the lawsuit, on the basis that the police report offered clear discovery of the crime Gelb was being accused of, as well as a shortage in facts that are necessary to compel a case dismissal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montes De Oca set a pre-trial conference date for June 4. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unfortunate to see the various excuses for horrible behavior that have come up during this process,” Bertrand told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in response to the notion that he had “taunted” Gelb. “But I continue to believe that people must be held accountable for their actions against the LGBTQ community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand, who has attended every hearing since Gelb’s first arraignment date, praised the “many community leaders” who have made statements in support of the LGBTQ+ community in the aftermath of the incident.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gelb’s attorneys from Lynn &amp; O’Brien have not responded to requests for comment. Barnes also declined to comment after the arraignment.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Bertrand used the word “unfortunate,” not “unfair.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

For instance, the fee for the last UCen expansion, voted through in 1994, hasn’t risen from an initial figure of $20.42. <em>Stephany Rubio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business (F&amp;B) committee voted on Feb. 26 to reallocate an existing fund for a new A.S. Bike Shop building toward a Bike Shop in the University Center (Ucen) instead. In late March, the Office of Budget and Planning provided updated calculations for the UCen fees.</p>\n<p>Students voted to approve a new bike shop building fund back in 2006. The building has never been built and students continue to use the existing Bike Shop building to repair their bicycles.</p>\n<p>F&amp;B Chair Kian Maalizadeh obtained updated calculations of how potential UCen student fees would look.</p>\n<p>With the Bike Shop funding now going toward the UCen renovation, the two student fees for the UCen project would decrease. The fees will be voted upon on the spring A.S. elections ballot.</p>\n<p>The first $21.42 fee is now $20.40 and will still be in effect from 2018 to 2022. The second $99.61 fee is now $96.06 and students will pay it from 2022 to 2052.</p>\n<p>Both fees will take effect if students vote to pass the UCen project later this month.</p>\n<p>In the 12 years since the fund was created, students have paid the resulting $5.50 quarterly student fee and voted to reaffirm it every two years. The fee has generated over $2 million in revenue in the process, Maalizadeh said.</p>\n<p>“We have this fee that’s being voted on every two years and that’s just sitting there to be used for a new Bike Shop,” Maalizadeh said. “[The UCen project] is the only plan that’s actually been proposed to use those student fees.”</p>\n<p>After the Bike Shop is built in the UCen, the lock-in fee associated with it would expire. The current Bike Shop building, located next to Parking Lot 29 on campus, would be demolished.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Bike Shop is housed in a 40-year-old cargo container that is “not meant for human occupation,” the official F&amp;B reallocation ballot language reads.</p>\n<p>“There are no bathrooms, the floors are rotting and it is a hazard to the students occupying the space,” the language reads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCen fee rises with inflation rates</strong></p>\n<p>While the UCen ballot petition language referred to two successive student fees, the second fee is not fixed. Instead, the fee will climb each year, roughly alongside inflation rates, according to a fee referendum document obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Before the 30-year fee was adjusted for the Bike Shop reallocation, it stood at $99.61. But with inflation rates, the fee rises each year by a rate that ranges between just under 0.7 percent to about 1.17 percent.</p>\n<p>As a result, the $99.61 fee increases to about $129.46 in 2052, the final year the fee would be in effect. That would push the total revenue generated from student fees to a number much higher than the $193 million the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">reported</a> in early March.</p>\n<p>Now, the $99.61 fee has been offset to $96.06, but inflation will still apply to the reduced fee, and the total amount of money raised from student fees will be much higher than $48 million, which is what officials say is the total cost of the project.</p>\n<p>It is unclear at this time how exactly the new projected fees would be affected by inflation.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Hieu Le did not confirm that the new amounts will rise by the same rates because no one has run the numbers yet, he said.</p>\n<p>“Those figures haven’t been calculated yet for these new numbers,” Le said. “But we do know, with this new $2 million in place, what the initial figures are.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Inflation estimates inconsistent across fees</strong></p>\n<p>Not many other student fees at UCSB appear to be affected by inflation. For instance, the fee for the last UCen expansion, voted through in 1994, hasn’t risen from an initial figure of $20.42.</p>\n<p>The inflated costs are lower than what real inflation rates will look like over the next 34 years, UCSB economics professor Peter Rupert told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“Realistic inflation is going to be more like 2 percent,” said Rupert, who also directs the local Economic Forecast Project. “Right now it’s incredibly low, it’s the lowest it’s ever been.”</p>\n<p>The UCen renovation, dubbed the “NewCen” initiative, was first proposed by Le in January. It would provide expanded office space to student services like Food Bank, Counseling and Psychological Services and Campus Learning Assistance Services. In addition, a renovated UCen would provide a 24/7 study space and a campus pub.</p>\n<p>With the F&amp;B’s reallocation, the finished UCen will also include a new A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>Students can vote to approve the initiative with 50 percent plus one “yes” vote on the spring A.S. elections ballot.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the

Currently, the machine is the only bitcoin ATM in Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blaufuss co-founded the bitcoin ATM company Coind LLC with a hometown friend. They funded the startup costs themselves, confident that the ATMs would provide a steady cash flow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, it has proven noticeable. I.V. Deli Mart customers frequently stop to examine it, mostly out of curiosity, said Deli Mart owner Michael Hassan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people come in and look at it and say, ‘Oh look, bitcoin!’” Hassan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But not too many I.V. residents have actually bought in. Blaufuss estimated the machine gets about two to three purchases a day — each worth about $300. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its invention in 2009, bitcoin’s popularity has steadily climbed through internet word-of-mouth. Its major selling point is that transactions are encrypted and decentralized, which means it can’t be easily stolen and central banks can’t track the exchanges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATMs provide another platform for people to obtain the currency, complementing online exchanges like Coinbase. The ATM in I.V. allows only purchases; withdrawals must be carried out online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is valued at more than $7,000 per coin as of Saturday, but the amount is strikingly volatile and can sharply rise or decline from day to day. The currency is so speculative that even a single piece of bad news can lead to bitcoin owners dumping and ditching their share of the market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In just the past four months, the value has plummeted from a </span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-hits-new-record-high-as-warnings-grow-louder-idUSKBN1E919T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record high</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of nearly $18,000, after news broke that foreign governments are attempting to </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/05/bitcoin-drops-more-than-14-percent-to-below-7000.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">add regulations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cryptocurrency transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even Blaufuss has sold all of his bitcoins, though he noted that the value may rebound just as quickly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The market right now is just trash,” he said. “Everything is in the gutter. I’ve sold everything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But it’s a good time to buy right now, because everything is so cheap,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ATMs have picked up steam after a slow start, said James Forshaw, Blaufuss’ friend and company co-founder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“College students are a lot more aware of bitcoin and how to use it,” Forshaw said. He and Blaufuss have set up another ATM in Agoura Hills and plan to place one in Oxnard in the near future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATM customers don’t have to buy one whole coin every time — since the currency is digital, it can be broken down into fractional amounts that run as many as eight decimal places.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporters laud the currency as a future competition to the dollar, given how little encryption and how much oversight currently exists for dollar transactions. But critics have dismissed the currency, calling its popularity a </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/bitcoin-bubble/547952/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get-rich-quick bubble</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and comparing it unfavorably with more stable cryptocurrencies like ethereum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blaufuss noted in a Facebook post earlier this month that his company would consider adding ethereum to the ATM’s selections.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The enthusiasm behind cryptocurrency is buoyed by a faith that society will one day value encrypted transactions as a serious alternative to trading legal tender. Blaufuss didn’t commit to a philosophical stance, but he does believe the ATM will be successful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make it as quick, easy and painless as possible,” Blaufuss said. “And you won’t have to worry about giving your credit card information to companies that can later be hacked. It’s the safest way possible.”    </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82164\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/student-sets-up-bitcoin-atm-at-i-v-deli-mart/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82164\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/student-sets-up-bitcoin-atm-at-i-v-deli-mart/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/student-sets-up-bitcoin-atm-at-i-v-deli-mart/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/student-sets-up-bitcoin-atm-at-i-v-deli-mart/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-02/student-sets-up-bitcoin-atm-at-i-v-deli-mart/","id":4305,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4304,4303,4302],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Landlord Gelb’s Arraignment Repeatedly Postponed","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-03-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6119.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6119.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gelb's hearing is now scheduled for April 19.

His controversial, often profane communications with his residents are frequently caught on video and published on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, Gelb was charged with a misdemeanor after he was filmed hurling a barrage of homophobic slurs at I.V. Community Services District President Ethan Bertrand on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The video shows Gelb repeatedly calling Bertrand a “fag” and making lewd references to anal sex after Bertrand had told him that he treats his residents poorly. Bertrand, who is openly gay, serves on the I.V.

Gelb issued a statement in response, attributing his lack of filter to Asperger’s Syndrome and accusing Bertrand of calling him a “pedophile” and a “felon” before the video began — a claim Bertrand has since denied.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Days later, Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley announced the county would charge Gelb with one count of disturbing the peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Gelb’s arraignment has been continually delayed.

Even with outside donations, the amount students would pay in fees still far exceeds the $48 million total that officials have mentioned.</p>\n<p>If the bill were passed, only part of the student fees would go toward renovating and maintaining the UCen. A much larger portion would go toward paying off loans that the university would take out to finish the job in just four years. The university would need 30 more years to pay off those loans, plus interest.</p>\n<p>The fees would also include administrative costs, which would go to A.S., UCSB administration and financial aid distribution.</p>\n<p>The “NewCen” project, which Le first introduced in late January, would bring the UCen a 24-hour study space, a project laboratory, expanded office space for campus organizations and a central pub.</p>\n<p>Le contends that the time is ripe to “revitalize” the facilities because the UCen was last renovated back in 1994, when UCSB held 8,000 fewer students.</p>\n<p>“The revitalized complex is envisioned as the heart of campus by the UCSB lagoon where students can congregate, eat, socialize, study, work, debate and collaborate,” the petition reads.</p>\n<p>If Le can secure 3,116 valid signatures by March 16 and the UC Office of the President gives approval, the NewCen will be placed on the Associated Students elections ballot this April. Then, students could vote to pass the fee by a threshold of 50 percent plus one voter. The fee would take effect in the 2018-19 school year.</p>\n<p>If passed, the renovation would require a $21.42 quarterly student fee until 2022, after which students would pay a $99.61 quarterly fee through 2052.</p>\n<p>The earlier, $21.42 fee is for students who would never see the results of a UCen renovation. Over the following 30 years, UCSB students would continue paying for the renovated building, which would be finished by 2022.</p>\n<p>At Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Le said that it is still “entirely uncertain” if student fees will be needed to pay for the project at all. He mentioned that he may have a “unique opportunity” to work with “big donors” who could offset the total cost of the project.</p>\n<p>First-year history major James Ferraro, who has followed the project’s early development, also estimated a $190 million cost for the project when he spoke at the Senate public forum.</p>\n<p>While the UCSB Office of Development could contribute to the funding, there is a cap to the amount the office could give, Ferraro told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>In the “best-case scenario,” the office would put $35 million toward funding the renovation, Ferraro said, citing Le’s own estimation at a recent organization meeting. Realistically, the office may contribute between $15 and $35 million.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/","id":2302,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[2301,2300,2299],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Illes was taken to the hospital after the attack, where she underwent surgery and eight blood transfusions. Cyrus Rocky McClain was arrested for the assault. <em>Alex Gorman / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lauren Illes, 24, lost nearly half of her blood and needed eight blood transfusions to survive the incident, she said. She is now on the way to a full recovery.</p>\n<p>Police arrested Cyrus Rocky McClain, 19, on Saturday. McClain was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and infliction of bodily harm while committing a felony. He is being held in Santa Barbara County Jail on a $500,000 bail.</p>\n<p>McClain was a part-time Santa Barbara City College student in the fall, but he was no longer enrolled at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p>Illes spoke to the <em>Nexus </em>about fighting off her attacker and nearly dying from her injuries. She offered both praise and criticism of law enforcement’s response, taking issue with a Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) press release that referred to her injuries as “not life threatening.”</p>\n<p>SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover clarified that Illes’s injuries were not life threatening at the time of the suspect’s arrest. Hoover, who wrote the release, said she was not trying to trivialize Illes’s injuries, but rather assure the community that Illes was no longer at risk of dying. Still, multiple news outlets erroneously reported that the stab wound itself did not endanger Illes’s life.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, Illes stood with her boyfriend on the driveway of her Del Playa Drive home, watching police break up a party across the street. Illes, a third-year environmental studies major, transferred to UCSB in the fall.</p>\n<p>She saw groups of friends pass by until she noticed a man, dressed in all black, walking around in circles by himself. She had never seen him before, she told the <em>Nexus</em> on Monday.</p>\n<p>“He was looking into my house, and he had gone past my driveway into the back part of my patio, so he had crossed into my property,” Illes said.</p>\n<p>Her boyfriend pressured the unknown man to leave, and he eventually complied, she said.</p>\n<p>All was calm for about 15 minutes. Then, out of nowhere, the man jumped on her and began pounding her with his fists, she said.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know that I had been stabbed, and so I was actually trying to fight back,” she said. “I was punching him and chasing him. And then I got really, really light-headed.”</p>\n<p>“I looked down and there was just so much blood all over me, and it just kind of kept pouring out. I was really confused because I didn’t know what happened, and then I just kind of collapsed over there in my driveway.”</p>\n<p>While Illes lay in the driveway, her boyfriend began chasing her assailant, she said. During the chase, he started shouting at officers to attend to Illes. Before that moment, the officers across the street had been busy detaining a partygoer, Hoover told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>After law enforcement responded, Illes was transported to the hospital. By the time she arrived, she had lost nearly half of her blood, and her bladder was plainly visible. The knife had also severed her iliac vein, which drains blood from the pelvis.</p>\n<p>Surgeons operated on Illes for over three hours. She received eight blood transfusions and nearly lost her life during the surgery, she said. When she woke up in a hospital bed with 11 staples in her body, she felt a lot of things — but mostly lucky to be alive.</p>\n<p>“I felt extreme gratitude,” she said. “The hospital and the care that I’ve gotten is really amazing.” She was especially grateful for one of the responding cops, whom she said was trained in dealing with on-site trauma injuries.</p>\n<p>Within 24 hours, law enforcement had arrested a suspect for the crime.</p>\n<p>McClain was arrested and booked into the county jail after law enforcement brought him in for questioning. Illes said she and her boyfriend both identified McClain in a photo line-up, not knowing police had already arrested him.</p>\n<p>Illes praised law enforcement for the quick turnaround, saying she was “grateful they spent the whole night trying to find the guy.”</p>\n<p>But in an anonymous <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/8052yw/stabbing_ucsb_student_update/\">Reddit post</a> on Saturday, Illes’s boyfriend criticized the police’s initial response.</p>\n<p>“I chased the attacker away right passed [sic] them yelling and they absolutely did nothing,” he wrote. “Additionally, only one police officer on the scene was trained in trauma injuries. This is disturbing given their perceived preparedness in situations like this only a couple years after the shooting.”</p>\n<p>“They watched the attacker run away as I’m screaming the situation at them – he could have been easily caught,” he added. Illes’s boyfriend, who wished to remain anonymous, verified his identity to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Hoover, speaking for the SBSO, refuted his statements.</p>\n<p>“Any inference that the deputies didn’t react quickly is simply not the case,” she said. “In fact, deputies acted immediately when they learned that a stabbing had occurred, and they worked along with detectives throughout the night to locate and arrest the individual. They immediately cared for the victim and their actions are what helped save her.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another thing stuck out to Illes. On Friday night, as she slouched onto a telephone pole, dozens of people walked by her and did nothing to help, she said. Some passersby even took photos of her.</p>\n<p>“The world doesn’t make a whole lot of sense anymore,” she said. “I would just like people to try and regain a little bit of their humanity because the fact that I had to lie there, thinking that I was dying, and having people go, ‘Oh my god, look at this!’ and take pictures — that was so disgusting to me. That bothers me almost more than anything.”</p>\n<p>Illes will take time off from UCSB as she recovers from her injuries. Barring infection or damaged tendons, she is on the path to a full recovery. But she still has no explanation for why she was attacked and firmly denies knowing the suspect before the assault.</p>\n<p>“There’s something that you can expect and you see coming, but this just seems so wildly unprovoked, so out of nowhere,” she said. “There’s no way to really explain it, other than [that] it’s just really sad.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of the story said Illes slouched onto a telephone pole “with a knife inside her body.” There is not yet evidence to indicate the knife was still in her body. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the March 1, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/i-v-stabbing-victim-recounts-attack/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/i-v-stabbing-victim-recounts-attack/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/i-v-stabbing-victim-recounts-attack/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/i-v-stabbing-victim-recounts-attack/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/i-v-stabbing-victim-recounts-attack/","id":4327,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4326,4325,4324],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/28"}},"__N_SSG":true}
