I thought we accomplished that. Sometimes when you get ahead it’s easy to let down, [and] just sort of play sloppy.

Despite entering on a four-match winning streak, Whittier’s losses to San Jose State and UCSB lands the Poets at 11-9 overall. La Verne’s slump extended to four matches, handing the Leopards a record of 2-13.</p>\n<p>Excluding its 10-7 loss to No. 1 UCLA on Thursday, Santa Barbara has not allowed an opponent to score within double-digits. Also, the pair of wins transcends the Gauchos’ home record of 3-3 last season as they improved to 5-1 as host at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>Facing both programs for the first time since 2013, UCSB sustained its undefeated records against the two schools with improved all-time records of 11-0 against the Leopards and 9-0 against the Poets.</p>\n<p>UCSB established its savviness on offense from the gates in its matchup against Whittier with a 3-0 scoring run to start the first period. At the center of the Gauchos’ scoring surge in the first half was freshman utility Ivan Gvozdanovic. He registered a match-high four goals, tallying a hat trick in the first two periods of the game to contribute to the team’s 9-2 lead at the half.</p>\n<p>Scores by senior two-meter Wedge Molthen and freshman lefty Andrew Breeden were the only goals of the game for Whittier as the Gauchos held them scoreless in the entirety of the second half.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s scoring pace remained consistent to open the second half with goals by senior attacker Thomas Martinho and senior utility Reed Cotterill less than a minute into the third quarter. Martinho finished with a hat trick of three scores while Cotterill ended with two goals.</p>\n<p>It was at the 4:27 mark of the fourth quarter that UCSB called a timeout to begin sending substitutions into the game. A final goal by sophomore defender Max Schaum with seven seconds remaining in the game secured UCSB’s 16-2 victory.</p>\n<p>Igniting UCSB’s momentous performance against the Poets was its victory over La Verne earlier in the morning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos displayed diligence on offense with nine goals in the first half, embarking on an 8-0 scoring stretch through the majority of the first half. UCSB’s streak was ended when the Leopards’ junior driver Joshua Vega scored La Verne’s first goal to trim UCSB’s lead to 9-1 going into the hall.</p>\n<p>A total of seven different Gauchos scored during the run with Cotterill notching two goals. UCSB’s efficiency when attacking resulted in a .417 shooting percentage on 36 shots. UCSB continued its dominance with six goals in the second half, leading to its 15-3 win.</p>\n<p>While enduring five games in four days is a daunting task for any team, the results of the Gauchos’ intense conditioning during “Hell Month” has been beneficial in their string of matches.</p>\n<p>“They train hard. A month before school starts we’re here training every day,” said Wigo. “Depending on the day, [we train] six to eight hours. Guys are physically; they’re prepared for this. When we go to big tournaments you have to play one hard game after another. These two days, we played in a lot of games, but we were able to make a lot of substitutions, rest and keep the tempo up.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will end its five-game stretch at No. 3 USC this Sunday, Oct. 16 at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In the 1983-84 season, however, Wilson simply needed a break from his coaching duties of 80-hour work weeks and returned to his alma mater Cal and became the program’s aquatic director.</p>\n<p>Despite returning to his former university, there was a void within Wilson, and his love for the game eventually drew him back to UCSB. However, his return to the pool deck would eventually change with an increase in duties.</p>\n<p>“What I realized was I missed the stimulation of the student-athlete, the challenges that presented themselves here [at UCSB],” Wilson said. “They decided during my absence to merge the men’s and women’s teams. They invited me back [as the] aquatic director [and] head coach and that started the programs together. It exceeded my expectations; I had to learn a lot. I went down to working 60-70 hours a week and everything really took off. It was an experiment for the department. It worked so well that they merged the men’s and women’s track programs and that was right at the beginning of a lot of programs across the country merging men and women together.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72857\" style=\"width: 236px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72857\" data-attachment-id=\"72857\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/retirement-celebration-for-ucsbs-aquatic-legend-gregg-wilson-this-saturday/gregg-by-jenny-luo-online-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gregg-by-jenny-luo-online-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72857\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=226%2C339\" alt=\"gregg-by-jenny-luo-online-6\" width=\"226\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72857\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gregg Wilson was UCSB’s head swim coach for the past 40 years. He saw two of his athletes win Olympic gold medals. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The merge of both the men’s and women’s programs marked Wilson’s return to UCSB for the 1985-86 season. From that point on, he became the pioneer of a new and improved culture at UCSB that fostered a generational growth for the next 40 years.</p>\n<p>A mastermind of the complexities within swim, the veteran coach accumulated a myriad of accolades that comfortably rank atop the Gaucho record book.</p>\n<p>Wilson retired with a total of 36 Big West titles and was appreciated for his prominence within the conference, winning 27 Big West Coach of the Year awards in addition to earning two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) Coach of the Year honors.</p>\n<p>Defined by longevity, it is surprising that he initially was signed on a short-term contract for five years, but the terms were eventually eliminated.</p>\n<p>The extension of Wilson’s time at UCSB may serve as one of the program’s most beneficial decisions, as his guidance helped enhance the skills of various talented swimmers. Throughout Wilson’s tenure, approximately 72 swimmers were rewarded with All-American status. Most notably, his prevalence in national competition ascended as well, as he coached three Olympians, including former Gauchos and Team USA gold medalists Richard Schroeder and Jason Lezak.</p>\n<p>Although the extensive list of milestones were well-deserved achievements, Wilson’s never allowed his reputable coaching status to outshine the true importance of maintaining a commitment to his student-athletes.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have a lot of scholarship money, so I set the goal of [seeing] what I could do with raw material,” Wilson explained. “[My mindset was] come here for very little or nothing and let’s see what we can do. Probably the best example of that are the two gold medal winners that we have.”</p>\n<p>Schroeder walked on to the UCSB swim program out of the junior college ranks and worked his way into representing the United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics, excelling and earning gold. Following Schroeder nearly two decades later was Lezak, who Wilson explained was a good swimmer coming out of high school but reached his pinnacle at the collegiate level, becoming an All-American and eventual gold medalist as well.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the fact that UCSB may not have ever been considered an elite swimming program, Wilson’s commitment to teaching student-athletes the true craft of swim fueled his long-term stay in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, those student-athletes appreciated this passion, as his lasting impression remains evident.</p>\n<p>“He represented a great legacy for 40 years,” senior Meghan Bicomong said. “Gregg’s really personal with the Gaucho family. Everyone is connected together [which helped] build team comradery and that really hits home for me because he’s super personal and that’s what kind of helped me to get into this school and helped me decide on going here.”</p>\n<p>Certainly, Wilson possessed a competitive edge when coaching, but it was his hospitable nature that provided a sense of balance that attracted the likes of so many players.</p>\n<p>“I played water polo for the most of my life so I didn’t think I was going to be much of a swimmer,” senior Matt Drum explained. “My high school season ended, then I got this call from Gregg and he’s like, ‘Hey, do you want to come swim at UC Santa Barbara?’ I didn’t do so well my last year [of high school] but Gregg somehow still believed in me to come here, so I owe him a lot for that.”</p>\n<p>Well-deserving of his recognition for the mark he has left on the UCSB campus and swimming program, Wilson’s efforts expand to the Santa Barbara community as a whole with the establishment of Wilson Swimming. The community swimming program offers swimming camps and lessons here at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>While Wilson’s impact will remain unmatched, UCSB has shown great appreciation for the former coach with the creation of the Gregg and Carol Wilson Swimming Enhancement Fund. The fund will aid and support the swimming program’s operational budget.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Gregg Wilson’s retirement party will take place this Saturday, Oct. 8 from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion.

USC was a Pac-12 champion a year ago,” said Macedo. “Having some men out of the meet [Saturday] was disappointing and difficult for us. Swimming that meet against that caliber of competition with 11 guys: It was challenging, but I’m proud of the way they swam.”</p>\n<p>Missing from UCSB’s intended 12-man lineup for the day was junior transfer from University of Indiana and IM/breaststroke swimmer Jonathan Panchak, who suffered a neck injury.</p>\n<p>Of the 14 events that took place on Saturday, 11 of which were individual races, UCSB managed to finish in first place twice.</p>\n<p>Emerging for the Gauchos’ first victory of the meet was senior Yoessef Tibazi with a time of 48.88 seconds in the 100-yard butterfly. USC senior Michael Domagala narrowly trailed him with a clock-in time of 49.35 seconds.</p>\n<p>Following right after Tibazi with a win in the 100-yard IM was sophomore backstroke/IM swimmer Douglas Nogueira. He collected the first-place finish in 52.41 seconds, just ahead of two fellow Gauchos, Tibazi and sophomore butterfly/IM swimmer Javier Lopez. Tibazi placed second with a time of 53.70 seconds while Lopez was registered at 54.33 seconds.</p>\n<p>Certainly the victories of Tibazi and Nogueira elicited a sigh of relief from the Gauchos, but it was evident the team’s lack of players — due to suspension and the women’s team not having a scheduled meet — took its toll on the players who competed Saturday.</p>\n<p>“They [didn’t] have the women to separate and give them more time in between races,” said Macedo. “Some of those boys had to go from one event directly into another and that’s a really hard way to go into that meet. We’ve got some work to do; we looked a little sloppy in some areas, but at the same time we know what we need to improve.”</p>\n<p>Sure enough, USC took advantage of the Gauchos’ shortcomings and ended Saturday’s meet with a total of nine first-place swimmers.</p>\n<p>Leading the Trojans with two first-place wins was junior Dylan Carter. He established his presence early in the third event of the meet, winning in the 200-yard freestyle at 1:37.90. Finishing with a time nearly four seconds quicker than the second-place finisher, Carter’s imprint on the meet surfaced early.</p>\n<p>But the competition became more intense as the Trojans’ top swimmer participated in the 100-yard freestyle, which also included the Gauchos’ prominent Tibazi. Carter prevailed and continued his dominance with victory at a time of 45.47 while Tibazi swam closely behind at 46.09 seconds.</p>\n<p>Surely the Gauchos’ lack of depth should be of consideration when analyzing the results of Saturday’s meet, but much work is to be done if they plan on helping their first-year coach obtain immediate success.</p>\n<p>Although Macedo is in his first season as head coach at UCSB, it is his third year with the program. While he’s still working to figure things out inside the pool, Macedo doesn’t have to change his vision too much, as most of the pieces he’s been working with since day one are still in place.</p>\n<p>“What I want to do is continue a very strong culture of hard work and academic success,” said Macedo. “I want to put my own twist on that; we’ve got a new staff this year [and] Gregg is still around volunteering, [which] is a real resource of mine to have him to bounce ideas off of and [see how did he] handle this in the past.”</p>\n<p>Next for both the UCSB men’s and women’s teams is the program’s annual Intrasquad and Alumni games. The pair of exhibition matchups with take place on Saturday, Oct. 8 with the Intrasquad game starting the morning off at 9 a.m., followed by the Alumni match at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p>Both games will be hosted at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72802\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72802\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/","id":1776,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1775,1774,1773],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Hall of Fame Nominees Announced; Top 3 RBs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After the recent release of the NFL Hall of Fame's Class of 2017 nominations, Sports Editor Sean White keys in on the running back position specifically and forms a Top 3 list of ball carriers that sh...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the last few years of NFL football, we have watched the depreciation of the running back position.

He ranks as the Bolts all-time leader in career rush attempts (2,880), yards (12,490), and touchdowns (138).</p>\n<p><strong>Terrell Davis, Denver Broncos, 8 seasons (1995-2002)</strong></p>\n<p>A career deflated by injury proneness and an extreme knee injury during the 1999 season that marked his drastic decline and eventual retirement in 2002, the legend of Terrell Davis remains a tale of what could have been.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yy-lnbMfhNg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>One of seven running backs in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in a single-season and crowned the 1998 NFL MVP after rushing for 2,008 yards and an all-time sixth ranking 21 touchdowns on 392 carries; Davis was destined to etch his name amongst the greatest in the league’s record books but unfortunately was plagued with injuries after putting up some of the best stats by a rusher in his first four years in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Helping lead Denver to back-to-back Super Bowl rings in 1997 and 1998, the Broncos’ all-time career rushing leader accumulated 6,413 rushing yards and 56 rushing touchdowns in his first four seasons.</p>\n<p>Via Kevin Patra of <em>nfl.com</em>, Davis owns the highest career playoff rushing average at 5.59 yards per attempt and is tied with Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith for most playoff 100-yard rushing games at seven but distinguishes himself by completing this feat in seven-straight postseason matchups. Nonetheless, he is one of 12 players in NFL history to win Super Bowl MVP and AP NFL MVP (Patra, <em>nfl.com</em>). While his statistics will forever be admired, the mind will only continue to wonder how Davis’ career would have ultimately ended if healthy.</p>\n<p><strong>Eddie George, Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans/Dallas Cowboys, 9 seasons</strong></p>\n<p>A hardnosed bruiser at 6-3, 235 pounds complemented by his speed and agility to cut in and out of gaps, Eddie George was like a created player in a video game when on the field.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72714\" style=\"width: 452px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72714\" data-attachment-id=\"72714\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/72713/footballhalloffame/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?fit=3000%2C3000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,3000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"footballhalloffame\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72714\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=442%2C442\" alt=\"Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus \" width=\"442\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footballhalloffame.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72714\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>His impact in the backfield was immediate as he won the 1996 NFL AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award after rushing for 1,368 yards and eight rushing touchdowns off of 335 rushing attempts.

The Golden Bears will look to improve upon their 11-1 record.</p>\n<p>However, for UCSB, overcoming its 12-year winning drought vs. Cal will be no easy feat. In what will be the only regular season matchup between the two programs this year, the anticipation surrounding the Gaucho-Golden Bear showdown has certainly increased after meeting each other a total of four times last season.</p>\n<p>Entering Saturday with an advantage will be Cal as it won each of the four matches.</p>\n<p>Despite already experiencing a loss to the Golden Bears last Saturday, the Gauchos remain confident in their capabilities to overcome their hump but know they must sustain consistency against Cal’s ongoing attack.</p>\n<p>“[Last Saturday it was] 9-8 in the third quarter. [We] gave up a couple of sloppy goals,” Asssitant Coach Ryan McMillen said. “It’s a four quarter game. We had three good quarters, [so] we’re working towards having four solid quarters on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Still, the Gauchos’ potential to upset the Golden Bears remains probable behind the recent play of senior utility Reed Cotterill. A transfer from Golden West College, Cotterill is emerging as one of Santa Barbara’s top players after playing in 28 games, scoring 25 goals and tallying seven assists in his first season at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Cotterill leads the Gauchos in scoring with 15 goals and recently helped Santa Barbara get back on a winning track with a hat trick performance against No. 14 Princeton last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Aiding Cotterill has been the play of junior attacker Shane Hauschild. A Santa Barbara native, Hauschild finds himself second on the team in goals with 14 and is the team’s leader in shots and assists.</p>\n<p>While much time remains on the Gauchos’ schedule to develop as a team, Hauschild understands his role when in the pool and is looking to establish himself more as a team leader.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a new role for me this year,” Hauschild said. “In my first two years I scored a lot because I was the young kid that other teams thought they could leave me and let me try to beat them by myself. This year, me and Reed are getting more of that attention because we’re the older players. [Teams] kind of know who we are are so that’s opening things up for a lot of other guys on our team. I think this year will be a lot more balance scoring wise between everyone as opposed to one or two guys having way more goals than everyone else.”</p>\n<p>As UCSB will hope to establish balance on offense, it will need to ensure it does the same on defense as it prepares to face one of the nation’s best players.</p>\n<p>A pivotal asset within the Golden Bears’ success over the Gauchos all last season and currently having a strong 2016 campaign thus far is sophomore attacker Johnny Hooper.</p>\n<p>Building off an excellent freshman year in which he was crowned the 2015 MPSF Newcomer of the Year, Hooper’s current team-high of 37 goals ranks atop the conference in scoring along with his league-leading 3.08 goals per game.</p>\n<p>While Hooper serves as the Golden Bears primary attacker on offense, Cal possesses an arsenal of scorers that can emerge during any period of the game. Overall, the Golden Bears offense has accumulated a conference-high 192 team goals in 12 games played and lead the MPSF with 16.0 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Even without Hooper included, six other Golden Bears have recorded double-digit goal totals. Following Hooper’s team-high at 15 goals apiece are redshirt freshman Jordan Hoover and true freshman Safak Simsek.</p>\n<p>Set to face one of the most lethal offenses in the nation, it’s inevitable that the Gauchos’ defense will be tested. Cal is one of three teams this season that has reached UCSB’s season-high of 15 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>While no team can truly put the Golden Bears’ offense to a halt, Santa Barbara did return to the drawing board in pursuit of different results come Saturday. But it may take more than a week’s worth of practice for the Gauchos to reach their final form as a team as they have been doing double the work out of the pool.</p>\n<p>“It’s early in the seaosn for us,” McMillen said. “We just got done with our hell month. Most other school weren’t going through that, they were through two hard weeks. We were going eight hours a day for the first four weeks with a day off each week. Now school just started, we’ve done a little bit of a taper and we’re only going about two and a half hours a day.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal’s matchup will begin at noon this Saturday, Oct. 1, at Spieker Aquatics Complex.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 29, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/","id":5479,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5478,5477,5476],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Upset On the Road At Texas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-09-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo3-web1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo3-web1.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"Despite achieving the second best start in UCSB history, going 8-0, the UCSB women's soccer team had its streak ended in a 2-1 defeat to Texas on Sunday.

Receiving a deflected ball after attempting to make a pass to a teammate ahead, Hintzen sent a strike from about 25 yards out that managed to enter the net sailing right over Rogers’ hands.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite no other goal being scored in the first half, both teams continued to test each other’s defense as the end of the first half concluded with eight shots for UCSB and nine for Texas. In total, UCSB finished with 13 shots while the Longhorns finished with 14. Both programs remained persistent with their shot attempts in the second half as well with a total of five apiece.</p>\n<p>After allowing an early goal in the first half, UCSB responded with a quick goal of its own just 1:53 into the second half. Putting UCSB on the scoreboard was none other than junior forward Amanda Ball. Ranking second in the Big West in goals with eight, Ball was able to score off of an assisted pass from sophomore midfielder Sydney Magnin.</p>\n<p>Initially setting up the play was freshman forward/midfielder Shaelan Murison passing the ball to Magnin on a cross into the 18-yard box who then passed it to Ball for the shot on goal and score to tie the Longhorns 1-1.</p>\n<p>The stalemate nearly lasted for 20 minutes but was ended with a goal by Texas. Leading the charge in a 1 vs. 3 situation was freshman forward Tecora Turner for her first career goal.</p>\n<p>Despite playing just 21 minutes as a sub off the bench, Turner managed to score the game-winning goal off an assist from sophomore forward Alexa Adams in the 64th minute. Her late game heroics can be accredited for her earning the Big 12 Freshman of the Week award on Monday.</p>\n<p>Recording a total of seven corner kicks on Sunday, two in the second half, UCSB was unable to capitalize on any of its opportunities to possibly send Sunday’s match into overtime.</p>\n<p>Two road matches remain on UCSB’s schedule before it begins its Big West Conference schedule. Despite being 8-1 overall, the Gauchos must not overlook their final two non-conference matches in order to sustain momentum heading into conference play as Big West counterparts Hawaii (7-1) and UC Irvine (8-2) seem like they  will be strong contenders for the league title as well.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s final two non-conference matches will take place at Pacific LMU on Thursday, Sept 22 at 5 p.m. and at LMU on Sunday, Sept. 25 at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72500\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-19/gauchos-upset-on-the-road-at-texas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72500\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-19/gauchos-upset-on-the-road-at-texas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-19/gauchos-upset-on-the-road-at-texas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-19/gauchos-upset-on-the-road-at-texas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-19/gauchos-upset-on-the-road-at-texas/","id":1430,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1429,1428,1427],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lakers Finalize Training Camp Site at UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-09-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lakeshow.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lakeshow.jpg?resize=756%2C440&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will welcome Laker Nation to its campus for the team's training camp scheduled to take place from Sept. 27-Oct. 2.

With the talent of players such as Jordan Clarkson, D’angelo Russell and their selection of Brandon Ingram with the No. 2 pick in this year’s draft, the Lakers’ next franchise player is no guarantee but could surface in due time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Ingram seemingly poised to become the face of the L.A. franchise, the buzz surrounding the rookie has many convinced that he could eventually carry the torch after potentially being the No. 1 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting and playing in five summer league games, Ingram averaged 12.2 points per game while shooting 41.2 percent from the field and 25 percent from behind the three-point line. He also averaged 4.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game in addition to playing 27.4 minutes per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certainly summer league play is no true predictor of how a player will pan out in the long run, especially at the young age of 19 years old, but Ingram displayed some glimpses on the court that could lead to him flourishing within the NBA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately for Russell, last year was more of an underwhelming season. In addition to former Head Coach Byron Antom Scott placing Russell in and out of the starting lineup, finding the guard’s role on the team became a little difficult as to whether or not he would play the one or two position while alongside Clarkson in the backcourt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Scott’s coaching scheme seemed to stray away from Russell’s strengths, one can only predict that Walton will be able to conquer the puzzle of Russell and Clarkson after helping coach the NBA’s top backcourt duo in Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Nonetheless, Russell had his spurts in which he showcased his ability to produce when on the court whether scoring or assisting. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72441\" style=\"width: 409px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72441\" data-attachment-id=\"72441\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-17/lakers-finalize-training-camp-site-at-ucsb/russell-ice-veins/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?fit=800%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,553\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"russell-ice-veins\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?fit=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?fit=800%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72441\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?resize=399%2C276\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of deadspin.com\" width=\"399\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?resize=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?resize=768%2C531&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of deadspin.com</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, the Lakers must focus on training camp and their task of acclimating free agent additions Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng.

Currently in his 18th season, Vom Steeg has helped lift UCSB’s program to new heights since his debut season in 1999.</p>\n<p>Guiding Santa Barbara to its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 2002, the veteran coach has created a winning environment that has resulted in two national championship appearances in 2004 and 2006 in which the Gauchos defeated UCLA 2-1 for the title in their second trip.</p>\n<p>With longevity and the accolades to back it up, the all-around growth UCSB has made in nearly the last two decades illustrates a standard of consistency that Vom Steeg has helped create within the Gauchos’ program.</p>\n<p>“[It’s] been what I’m most proud of,” Vom Steeg explained. “I think the fact that we’ve made 13 trips to the postseason out of 17 years that shows that we’ve been able to do the right thing more often than not. To do that you need the right players, coaching staff and the right support networks, especially from our community.</p>\n<p>When you add it all up, you at least give yourself a chance to compete first for the Big West Championship, then a national championship.”</p>\n<p>The journey to championship games are always a tough mountain to climb but overcoming some of these obstacles is made much easier with the presence of senior forward Nick DePuy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72217\" style=\"width: 160px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72217\" data-attachment-id=\"72217\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/welcome-to-soccer-heaven/depuy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DePuy.jpg?fit=150%2C210&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"150,210\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DePuy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DePuy.jpg?fit=150%2C210&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DePuy.jpg?fit=150%2C210&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72217 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DePuy.jpg?resize=150%2C210\" alt=\"DePuy\" width=\"150\" height=\"210\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72217\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Senior forward Nick DePuy</p></div>\n<p>The reigning Big West Player of the Year for the past two seasons, DePuy is entering his final year as one of the most highly touted players in the nation.</p>\n<p>He finished with an NCAA leading 15 regular season and eight game-winning goals.</p>\n<p>“Nick is obviously a big success story for us,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s far exceeded any of our expectations. Now he goes into his senior year as probably one of the top three strikers in the country. But, I do think this that this year is a big challenge because I think he surprised people the last couple years, but he’s not going to surprise anybody this year. He will be the one player [teams] circle whenever anybody is scouting UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Although DePuy has excelled individually, it is not without the help of his teammates that has contributed to his growth as a player, especially since making the transition from being a midfielder to forward during his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>“Nick is not by himself creating his own opportunities,” Vom Steeg said. “He is the player that will finish the goal but it has to come off a lot of good things from other players. It’s really incumbent on the players that we put out on the field that they create opportunities for Nick. Fortunately for Nick, I feel like we have our best players returning to our offense and consequently Nick won’t have to do more than what he needs to do.”</p>\n<p>Despite winning the Big West North Division last season, the Gauchos fell short in the Big West Championship game affecting their chase for home field in the postseason. The Gauchos were able to advance to the Sweet 16 due in large part to being at home and having a great home crowd cheer them on. When having the advantage of a home field and fan base such as Harder Stadium, it could have only been most beneficial in pursuit of the national championship.</p>\n<p>“If your goal at the end of the season is to be playing home games at Harder Stadium then you cannot take any game for granted,” Vom Steeg said. “Our goal of course will be to put ourselves in that opportunity to win playoff games. Our players know that every single game we play equal the same [magnitude], we have to approach it the same way.”</p>\n<p>Thus far UCSB has looked exceptionally well, defeating Westmont 3-0 in its exhibition opener. DePuy finished with one goal in the Gauchos’ victory over the Warriors.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will officially begin its regular season on Friday, August 26 vs. Oakland at Ohio State.</p>\n<h3>Following is the remainder of the Gauchos’ 2016 schedule:</h3>\n<h3>August</h3>\n<p>Sat. 20<br>\nWestmont W, 3-0 Final<br>\nFri. 26<br>\nvs. Oakland @ Ohio St. 1:00 PM</p>\n<p>Sun. 28<br>\nat Ohio St. 4:00 PM</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>\nSeptember</h3>\n<p>Fri. 2<br>\nSan Diego 7:30 PM</p>\n<p>Sun. 4<br>\nSt. Mary’s (Cal.) 7:05 PM</p>\n<p>Sat. 10<br>\nvs. Butler @ Akron, Ohio 1:30 PM</p>\n<p>Mon. 12<br>\nat Akron 4:30 PM</p>\n<p>Sat. 17<br>\nUCLA 7:05 PM</p>\n<p>Wed. 21<br>\nLoyola Marymount 7:05 PM</p>\n<p>Sat. 24<br>\nCal 7:05 PM</p>\n<p>Thu. 29<br>\nat UC Riverside * 7:00 PM</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>\nOctober</h3>\n<p>Sat. 1<br>\nat Cal State Fullerton * 7:00 PM</p>\n<p>Thu. 6<br>\nUC Irvine * 7:30 PM</p>\n<p>Sat. 8<br>\nCal State Northridge * 7:05 PM</p>\n<p>Wed. 12<br>\nSacramento State * 7:05 PM</p>\n<p>Sat. 15<br>\nat Cal Poly * 7:00 PM</p>\n<p>Wed. 19<br>\nat UC Davis * 3:00 PM</p>\n<p>Sat. 22<br>\nCal Poly * 8:00 PM</p>\n<p>Wed. 26<br>\nat Sacramento State * 3:00 PM</p>\n<p>Sun. 30<br>\nUC Davis * 2:00 PM</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72319\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/welcome-to-soccer-heaven/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72319\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/welcome-to-soccer-heaven/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/welcome-to-soccer-heaven/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/welcome-to-soccer-heaven/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/welcome-to-soccer-heaven/","id":1443,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1442,1441,1440],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 13 Gauchos Gear Up for Beginning of Season, Host Westmont","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Despite being a No. 15 seed in the NCAA Tournament, the UCSB men's soccer team managed to reach the Sweet 16 for the seventh time in program history and for the first time since 2011.

Despite experiencing a 1-0 defeat to Cal State Fullerton in the Big West Championship, UCSB has been predicted to finish atop the Big West North Division standings for the fourth consecutive time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westmont is hoping to improve upon a 9-6-2 overall, 6-3-1 Golden State Athletic Conference record in 2015. It was a productive offseason for the Warriors as they added a total of nine recruits, one transfer and eight freshmen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although not included in the 2016 NAIA men’s soccer coaches’ preseason top 25 poll, the Warriors may not be too far from ascending into the rankings at some point this season. Their 6-3-1 conference record landed them tied for third place in the standings in addition to four of their players being named to the All-GSAC Team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While expectations are high for the Gauchos to be the premiere team in the Big West North Division, the anticipation for the senior campaign of forward Nick DePuy is at an all-time high after a milestone-filled breakout junior season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowned the Big West Conference Player of the Year for the second consecutive year, DePuy led the nation in game-winning goals with eight and regular season goals amongst all NCAA players with 15. His impact when on the field for UCSB is inevitable as the Gauchos are 16-0-4 all-time when DePuy scores at least one goal in a match. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both statistical totals led the Big West along with him being the conference leader in points (31) and shots (80). Becoming the fifth Big West player ever to be selected as a NSCAA All-American last season, DePuy was selected to the College Soccer News Preseason All-America First Team. His candidacy on the MAC Hermann Trophy Watch List tops off the fourth-year player’s list of accolades and nominations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside DePuy on the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team are junior forward Ahinga Selemani and junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, tying the Gauchos with Cal Poly for the most preseason selections at three players. Despite missing some time due to injury throughout the season, Selemani ranked second on the team in shots with a total of 57 while Feucht finished second on the team in goals with six.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66388\" style=\"width: 282px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66388\" data-attachment-id=\"66388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/mens_soccer_ucd_111115_eric_swenson_006-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Ahinga Selemani crosses the ball in for an unsuccessful attempt on goal.

Known for his coaching legacy of 11 championships with the help of NBA greats such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, Jackson is hoping to return a sense of hope to the New York basketball scene at Madison Square Garden.</p>\n<p>Although the suggestion of New York being a “superteam” after its offseason additions by newly acquired former MVP Derrick Rose is far-fetched, the Knicks seem prone to make a postseason return with its roster improvements.</p>\n<p>In addition to receiving Rose, Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round draft pick in a trade with the Chicago Bulls for Robin Lopez, Jerian Grant and Jose Calderon, the Knicks most notable additions included Joakim Noah, Courtney Lee and Brandon Jennings within their total of seven signees along with two re-signees.</p>\n<p>While New York has revamped its starting lineup and added a little depth to its bench, its most important move was hiring new Head Coach Jeff Hornacek.</p>\n<p>Possessing a 101-112 overall coaching record after three seasons with the Phoenix Suns, Hornacek presents a refreshing change to the “in-house” approach Jackson has pursued in New York with ties to time spent with the Los Angeles Lakers in the hire of Derrick Fisher and the promotion of interim replacement Kurt Rambis.</p>\n<p>Certainly it will take time for the Knicks’ new talent to mesh together, but it’s the players’ potential to thrive in a system other than the “triangle offense” that Jackson has forced coaches to implement since his arrival.</p>\n<p>Able to return from a knee injury last season, Carmelo Anthony is preparing to enter his 14th NBA season in hopes of making a final push for a championship ring in the tail end of his career.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72012\" style=\"width: 218px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72012\" data-attachment-id=\"72012\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-29/knicks-offseason-moves-may-remedy-recent-decline/new-york-knicks-vs-portland-trailblazers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=1808%2C1205&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1808,1205\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New York Knicks vs Portland Trailblazers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72012\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=208%2C138\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of slamonline.com\" width=\"208\" height=\"138\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?w=1808&amp;ssl=1 1808w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of slamonline.com</p></div>\n<p>Just once in Anthony’s career has he advanced further than the first round of the NBA Playoffs, enduring a 4-2 series loss in the 2009 Western Conference Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers while with the Denver Nuggets.</p>\n<p>A ball-dominant volume shooter, it is no question that Anthony will remain the team’s primary offensive scorer. Yet his role will have to adjust a bit as he prepares to play with players such as Rose, a slashing and driving point guard, along with accommodating the growth of Porzingis in his second year.</p>\n<p>With a renovated starting lineup intact, concerns still remain toward New York’s reserves on the bench. Jennings and Lee should be expected to carry the load as Jennings possesses an unpredictable scoring edge and Lee is a decent two-way player.</p>\n<p>With few impactful options available to come off the bench, the Knicks remaining alternatives can be considered a work in progress with players such as Mindaugas Kuzminskas, Maurice Ndour, Marshall Plumlee and Guillermo Hernangomez.</p>\n<p>With no draft pick in this year’s NBA Draft after including its 2016 first-round pick in its trade with the Toronto Raptors for Andrea Bargnani back in 2013, the questionability of New York’s bench only increases as it gets no return after trading away last year’s first-round pick in Grant.</p>\n<p>No, the Knicks aren’t sudden title contenders. Inevitably, the Knicks decline in the past three seasons has resulted in their inability to persuade a superstar free agent to join their team and make them a top contender.</p>\n<p>But this offseason was the most productive pursuit of uplifting the lifeless franchise since the acquisition of Anthony in 2010. Nonetheless, it has become possible again for the Knicks to land in the middle of the pack of the Eastern Conference standings in hopes of bringing back the New York allure that has been absent in most recent years.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72004\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-29/knicks-offseason-moves-may-remedy-recent-decline/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72004\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-29/knicks-offseason-moves-may-remedy-recent-decline/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-29/knicks-offseason-moves-may-remedy-recent-decline/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-29/knicks-offseason-moves-may-remedy-recent-decline/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-29/knicks-offseason-moves-may-remedy-recent-decline/","id":3322,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3321,3320,3319],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Witnessing The “King” Prevail","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bron-bron.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bron-bron.jpg?resize=750%2C500&ssl=1","description":"Despite facing a 3-1 deficit, LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers managed to fulfill what no other team in NBA history has ever achieved by winning the series 4-3.

While it has not always been this way, the “King” has been under a microscope of the public eye since his freshman year at St. Vincent-St. Mary’s High School in Akron, Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a “Kid from Akron,” it was history we witnessed Sunday night as LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers won the franchise’s first NBA title and became the first team ever to win an NBA Finals series despite trailing 3-1. Most notably, the Cavs’ title victory ended the city of Cleveland’s 52-year championship drought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the forefront of Cleveland’s comeback was the NBA’s best player: LeBron James.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzcUmtu_Hs8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winning his third championship title and Finals MVP, James successfully defended his throne as champion of the underdogs against a team that many considered to the best ever in the Golden State Warriors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When doubted most, the league’s best produced when it mattered, becoming the first player in NBA Finals history to lead all players in total points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals and 2.3 blocks per game in this year’s NBA Finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, the addition of another ring has ignited the ongoing debate with regard to where James ranks amongst NBA greats Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. While he trails Jordan (6) and Bryant (5) in rings, it’s plausible to believe that James could possibly become a member of the notorious ring-holders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An answer to this debate won’t prevail until James retires. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my book, Jordan reigns supreme as basketball’s greatest of all time. With a player like Bryant who modeled his game after “His Airness” and with James paving his own lane with a form of athleticism and versatility that we had never seen, it’s a debate that will still cause dispute when all is said and done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Sunday night marked the end of his 13th</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NBA season, James’ chance to further etch his name as one of the game’s greatest is optimal as much more basketball lies ahead in his career. Whether that extra time entails more championship rings will be most enticing in helping judge the King’s legacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of how James’ career ends, I’m sure we can all agree that we have never experienced a player with such a universal effect both on and off the court. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the weight of the state of Ohio on his shoulders, James delivered in the most dire time which was reflected with tears at the end of a Game 7 victory;

A four-year member of the varsity team, Allen also played for Santa Barbara Club Volleyball.</p>\n<p>Boasting a .362 hitting percentage at the end of her senior year, Rice presents a dual-threat skillset that can be productive both on the offensive and defensive sides of the net. Hailing from Redondo Union High School, she posted 32 kills and six blocks in a regional semifinals match this past postseason.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping her team win a Division IAA Championship her sophomore season, Rice’s high school career also includes a Third-Team AVCA All-America selection, 2015 Conference I Player of the Year honors and more.</p>\n<p>With a total of three middle blockers on its current 2016 spring roster, much intrigue has been directed towards the additions of Ennis and Robinson who both play the position as well.</p>\n<p>Preparing to make the trek from Virginia to Santa Barbara, Ennis attended First Colonial High School, where she put together an illustrious career with a program-record 1,340 kills. She is another proven winner added to the Gauchos’ roster, helping the Patriots win back-to-back Conference I Championships in 2013 and 2014. Ennis topped off her time spent playing in high school as an Honorable Mention AVCA Under Armour All-America recipient.</p>\n<p>Selected as one of the nation’s top 150 players in the nation in <em>Prepvolleyball’s</em> “Senior Aces” list, Robinson will enter UCSB next season after time spent with one of California’s best programs at Marymount High School of Palisades, Calif. Prior to the start of her senior season earlier this year, Robinson was ranked 16th amongst current players in the state in total kills.</p>\n<p>Helping ensure that plays and rotations go as planned will be the additions of libero Maxine Burke and Wisconsin transfer setter Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>Hoping to complement the play of sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi, a member of the Big West All-Freshman Team, Burke will be added to another impacted position as the Gauchos currently have three liberos aboard their team.</p>\n<p>Coming out of JSerra Catholic High School, Burke also played for Tstreet Volleyball Club. She was a Trinity League Second-Team selection in her senior season.</p>\n<p>The only player of this year’s recruiting class to participate on UCSB’s spring team, as other recruits wait to graduate, Juley will not have to redshirt in her first year with the Gauchos after redshirting her freshman year with the Badgers.</p>\n<p>Averaging 11.4 assists and 2.6 digs per match her senior year of high school, she helped Lyons Township High School earn a West Suburban Silver Championship. From LaGrange, Ill., Juley was an AVCA First-Team All-American in 2015 along with other accolades as she finished with 1,590 assists and 523 digs in her high school career.</p>\n<p>Assisting Coach Lantagne-Welch prepare this year’s team will be the hiring of Chad Gatzlaff as an assistant coach. He spent the last three seasons at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>\n<p>Along with Petrachi, another Big West All-Conference selection will be looking to have another productive year in senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt. For the second time in her career, Grunt was named a Big West Honorable Mention after ranking third in the conference in hitting percentage with a .335 average.</p>\n<p>Thus far, UCSB has played in three matches this spring. Beginning with its alumni match on April 9, Santa Barbara has faced Loyola Marymount and UCLA over the past two months.</p>\n<p>Although the preseason predictions of the Big West Media Poll are not always accurate in where teams will end up by the end of the season, last year’s third-place expectation may have been too much for the Gauchos, who declined after a 4-1 start to the season before enduring an 11-match losing streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 2016 regular season schedule has yet to be revealed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 26, 2016’s print edition

Thunder forward Kevin Durant’s step back dagger of a jump shot with 30.7 seconds remaining was a silent reminder of who reigns supreme in the team’s coveted 1-2 punch made up of himself and Russell Westbrook.</p>\n<p>Despite a 10-30 shooting night, going 2-11 in the fourth quarter, KD stayed committed to what each and every generation of shooters and scorers are told: KEEP SHOOTING.</p>\n<p>Surpassing LeBron James as the NBA’s best player in some fans’ player rankings just a few years back, it seems as if many have forgotten about the former 2013-14 MVP, four-time scoring champion and seven-time All-Star in lieu of Westbrook’s breakout seasons over the past year and a half.</p>\n<p>Ruled out indefinitely after playing in 27 games last season due to a Jones stress fracture in his right foot which required three surgeries, Durant’s hype gradually faded away as his body of work was slightly overshadowed by the championship run of Curry and the Warriors, LeBron’s return to Cleveland and the post All-Star break outburst of his teammate Westbrook who ended the 2014-15 season with eleven triple-doubles.</p>\n<p>With Westbrook tying NBA legend Erving ‘Magic’ Johnson’s all-time single-season record of 18 triple-doubles this season, notions of Durant as the Thunder’s secondary option became more convincing than ever.</p>\n<p>While the glitz and glamor of triple-doubles can be mesmerizing, has anyone taken the time to acknowledge the expense Westbrook’s success has come with?</p>\n<p>Sure, Westbrook led the league in scoring last season with an average of 28.1 points per game, yet he led the NBA in turnovers per game with 4.4 and nearly replicated these results this season, finishing just behind James Harden with 4.3 turnovers per game.</p>\n<p>Although Westbrook missed 15 games last season due to injury, which hindered OKC’s pursuit of securing the eight-seed, he was one of the most inefficient players during clutch periods of games in the regular season.</p>\n<p>According to <em>82games.com</em>, “clutch’ is defined as the period of the fourth quarter or overtime with less than five minutes left and neither team is ahead by more than five points. Westbrook’s volume of shots in late game situations display the ball dominance that occasionally detracts from the point guard’s impact on the court.</p>\n<p>Based on production per 48 minutes of clutch time, Westbrook averaged 51.2 total points, a scoring total that ranked third in the league. The five-time NBA All-Star was insufficient with his shot selection, taking 49.9 field goal attempts while shooting just 38.3 percent from the field and an abysmal 0.87 from beyond the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As expected with the return of Durant, Westbrook’s shot attempts in clutch time have endured a substantial decrease, which has served to his own benefit. Prior to the beginning of the NBA Playoffs, Russ concluded the season 14th in points with a 39.3 average on 32.1 field goal attempts in addition to shooting 38.9 percent despite a subpar 20.0 three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>Aside from three-point percentage, KD has actually been more efficient in his return this season than his 2013-14 MVP campaign.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71133\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71133\" data-attachment-id=\"71133\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/fullsizerender3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?fit=566%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,165\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender(3)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?fit=250%2C73&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?fit=566%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71133\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?resize=566%2C165\" alt=\"Statistics courtesy of 82games.com\" width=\"566\" height=\"165\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?w=566&amp;ssl=1 566w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?resize=250%2C73&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71133\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Statistics courtesy of 82games.com</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71134\" style=\"width: 581px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71134\" data-attachment-id=\"71134\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/fullsizerender4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?fit=571%2C195&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"571,195\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender(4)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?fit=250%2C85&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?fit=571%2C195&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71134\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?resize=571%2C195\" alt=\"Statistics courtesy of 82games.com\" width=\"571\" height=\"195\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?w=571&amp;ssl=1 571w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?resize=250%2C85&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Statistics courtesy of 82games.com</p></div>\n<p>Certainly one must consider the major constraints of OKC’s roster last season; he lost some of its scoring with the trade of Reggie Jackson to the Detroit Pistons and had to acclimate the role of Enes Kanter into the lineup after receiving him from the Utah Jazz in a three-team trade including the New Orleans Pelicans and lost Serge Ibaka for 18 games due to injury. It’s easy to argue that Westbrook had no choice but do to it all on his own.</p>\n<p>However, the team went 7-4 in the 11 games in which the Thunder’s floor general recorded a triple-double. Nonetheless, Oklahoma City endured two losing streaks of two or more games during his scoring, rebounding and assisting run. Nonetheless, the team finished 2-9 when Westbrook scored 40 or more points last year.</p>\n<p>Yet in his eighth season it has been a milestone season for Westbrook. Along with tying Magic’s triple-double record, Westbrook set a career-high in assists per game with a 10.4 average, his first time in double-figures.</p>\n<p>Arguably one of the NBA’s top five players, the aim was never to degrade the outstanding talent and determination of Westbrook but rather to remind those that KD is the driving force in Oklahoma City potentially becoming the next world champions.</p>\n<p>Currently third all-time in career points per game with a 27.4 average, Durant was the first introduction of many NBA fans of our generation to the hybrid, big-man-with-finesse playing style that is commonly witnessed today.</p>\n<p>Not one sign of regression appears in KD’s game thus far, surpassing the Black Mamba’s streak of consecutive games with 20-plus points at 67 games.</p>\n<p>In comparison to who many consider today as the NBA’s best player in Steph Curry, KD finished with a comfortable difference against the back-to-back MVP who had a scoring stretch of 20-plus for just 14 games earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>Both 27 years old and in their primes, inevitably the Durant-Westbrook duo will go down as one of the best player combinations in NBA history. Yet while KD’s game on the court may not be the most illustrious to the eye, the label as the league’s best could be most fitting with the “Darantula” in years to come.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71131\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71131\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/","id":3306,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3305,3304,3303],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Earns First Conf.

A Second-Team All-Big West selection last season, Murphy was named the tournament MVP.</p>\n<p>Enabling UCSB to reach the championship round was the fourth-year player’s game-winning goal in the second sudden victory period of the game following two overtime periods and one sudden victory session.</p>\n<p>“Sam really stepped it up this weekend. She was on the outside, inside, in transition, I mean she was everywhere,” Kay explained. “She’s co-captain with Lauren so she holds a big leadership role on the team. Additionally, she’s Big West scholar of the year, she’s got a 4.0 GPA. She’s the whole package.”</p>\n<p>Complementing the productive weekend performance of Murphy was UCSB’s attentive defense as it held each of its opponents to six or less goals, nearly two goals below its average allowance of 8.07 entering its contest versus the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ defense was most effective in the first half of Sunday’s matchup as they shutout Hawaii in the second period following their allowance of just one goal in the opening quarter of the game. Senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw recorded a total of seven saves.</p>\n<p>Although Murphy would go on to tally her third hat trick in the second half of Sunday’s game, the scoring contributions of redshirt center Lauren Martin with a first half hat trick, senior attacker Bryn Hudson, and junior utility Taylor Shore helped UCSB earn a 5-1 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Although the Rainbow Wahine managed to limit the Gauchos to one goal in the third period, Hawaii was unable to transform its defense into offense as freshman attacker Hannah Thompson was the lone goal scorer in the playing frame, which didn’t have much of a toll of the tam’s deficit as it still trailed 6-2.</p>\n<p>Despite scoring three goals in the game’s final period, Hawaii’s inconsistencies on defense hindered its comeback attempt as UCSB responded with five goals of its own to secure its championship victory.</p>\n<p>Included within UCSB’s championship run was an 8-4 win over No. 24 Cal State Northridge and its 7-6 sudden victory over No. 7 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>As a winner of three national championships in her four seasons as a starter at UCLA from 1996-2000, Coach Kay is hoping to integrate her extensive postseason experience along with her coaching abilities in preparing the Gauchos for their first NCAA appearance.</p>\n<p>“Something I learned as a player and throughout my coaching years going to the ‘Big Dance,’ it’s important to keep things in perspective,” Kay said. “We got here because of our hard work, team defense, and paying attention to the details and that’s what makes the difference. From my UCLA days, [according to a] John Wooden quote — ‘Little things makes big things happen,’ and that’s what we focused on this year and it worked.”</p>\n<p>The NCAA Tournament will be held at the UCLA Spieker Aquatics Center from Friday, May 13 through Sunday, May 15. The tournament’s selection show concerning team seedings and matchups will take place tonight beginning at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/","id":4996,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[4995,4994,4993],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":5,"highestPage":12,"route":"/authors/45"}},"__N_SSG":true}
