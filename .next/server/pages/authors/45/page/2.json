But his good deed was prevented from happening as liability concerns during the T-Dome’s after hours prohibited entrance aside from Gordon and his crew.</p>\n<p>But fans waiting in the night managed to get something in return as Gordon’s persistent plea to at least let fans in the gym to take photos was permitted prior to him beginning his workout.</p>\n<p>Although not in attendance, UCSB men’s basketball Head Coach Joe Pasternack’s presence was still felt as Gordon’s appearance was a reminder of the new coach’s aim to reestablish fun and excitement into the Gaucho program.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has shown love. Since I’ve been in Santa Barbara, [I figured] I’d peek through here, come through and get workouts in, they’ve always shown love,” Gordon said. “Now that Joe Pasternack is here, he’s shown love to me since I was on the Oakland Soldiers, playing with Archbishop Mitty [High School]. It’s just good to have a friend out here, he gets us in the gym. I wish I could have got everybody in [the Thunderdome], but you know there’s rules and regulations. It’s good to have Joe here, he’s really going to help the program out a lot.”</p>\n<p>During Pasternack’s tenure with the University of Arizona from 2011-2016, Gordon was a “one and done” player for the Wildcats in their 2013-14 season. He is one of many players, including former Wildcat and current Detroit Pistons forward Stanley Johnson who was training in the Thunderdome two weeks ago, that Pasternack played a significant role in when recruiting and developing the two All-American talents.</p>\n<p>Entering his fourth NBA season, Gordon is coming off a career year in which he started in 72 of 80 games and recorded a career-high 12.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>The former No. 4 pick of the 2014 NBA Draft is focused on the well-being of his body going into next season after a foot injury gave him trouble entering the All-Star break, which was evident in his underwhelming performance in the 2017 Slam Dunk Contest.</p>\n<p>“That’s the biggest thing, to get healthy. Find a rhythm, get healthy. As long as I’m healthy, everything ‘s going to be golden. I’ma do what I love to do,” Gordon said.</p>\n<p>With many aware of his freakish athleticism, Gordon has his sight set on taking his game further. Speculation as to whether or not he fits best at the small forward or power forward position had been up for debate throughout the majority of the season. No permanent answer has emerged regarding Gordon’s placement, but he flourished throughout the season.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4Subr0F21k?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>When asked about the area of his game that he is focusing on this offseason, Gordon kept it straightforward – “shooting threes.”</p>\n<p>With that being said, he seems to remain motivated to fill the hybrid/stretch role that Orlando is hoping for him to be. If health can work in his favor, anticipating a breakout season for Gordon may not be too far-fetched.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Dangerous. Untamed.</p>\n<p>These are the common misconceptions about life here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Overcoming, this false illusion has always been difficult, but the tragedy that occurred on May 23, 2014, was an unfortunate yet compelling reminder of the love and unity that reside within the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>Prior to this date, preparing to graduate from St. Mary’s High School in Stockton, Calif., and having already verbally committed to the UCSB men’s basketball team back in Aug. 2013, current junior shooting guard Gabe Vincent seemed to have everything figured out.</p>\n<p>But he, too, once shared uncertainty before this decision, yet his perspective was corrected as he was gradually integrated into the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>“When I was in high school and people would bring up [UCSB], it started to get a bad reputation. Everybody knew it was a party school, but that’s kind of a two-sided coin. People like to party and have fun and go to school, but some people are discouraged by that,” Vincent explained. “I for sure was at first. When you think of UCSB, most of the time that’s what you think of. Yes, you get a great education, but that party scene over there might be too wild. [But] the more I came out and got involved with the community and saw what they were about and got more comfortable here, [I saw] that people are in the library 24/7, people are grinding, taking classes, and that’s just a way for them to let loose. The community is so small that people are all together; it allows everyone to enjoy life together, which is awesome because not many places can have that.”</p>\n<p>As someone who had confirmed his love for basketball in the sixth grade and who was determined to put his all into the sport once he started playing at the AAU level, Vincent saw the advantages of UCSB’s location, beautiful women and Division I status, which seemed to provide an opportunity any prospective student-athlete would desire to seize.</p>\n<p>But the potential to be the university’s next star player with such incentives at his fingertips took a backseat during his realization of UCSB’s ability to bond and unite after the tragic loss of innocent lives just a year before his official enrollment at the school.</p>\n<p>“I came out here a lot, I took a few unofficial [visits] just to come see the guys practice. I had been out in I.V. and had seen that culture and kind of got accustomed to it to a point that it already felt like home. That was a big thing for me coming here because you have to be able to live somewhere when you’re not playing basketball, too,” Vincent said. “So when I heard the news about the shooting, that’s something that, even if you’re not attached to the school emotionally or physically, when you read that kind of tragedy, that hits your heart because that’s something that should never happen and is terrible to read or hear.”</p>\n<p>“When you are attached to it, like we are now, and I kind of was in a way then, it definitely hit home. It was sad to hear; I remember I came out the following weekend because I was coming up on another unofficial [visit] to see the guys practice, and even they were down,” Vincent said. “Looking out to the streets of I.V., they were dead quiet, nobody was out. The whole community was mourning what had happened. That was eye-opening because it’s not just everybody out here for themselves. Even though there are cliques or groups, we are still one strong community. The way people came together for that was inspiring.”</p>\n<p>Rather than be deterred from his choice to attend UCSB after such a horrific moment that made headlines nationwide, Vincent’s empathy influenced his newfound interpretation of such a unique community.</p>\n<p>The foundation for this compassion comes from Vincent’s parents, Cynthia and Franklyn, who are both psychologists. Once quoted saying his upbringing was “different,” Vincent holds a perspective of this three-year anniversary that only he can understand.</p>\n<p>“To me, honestly, psychology, even though there’s many facets of it, a lot of the times it’s just being able to read in-between the lines. A lot of people are going to put on a front or show this or that, but that might not be what they’re really feeling or showing,” Vincent said. “I think that plays a big role in terms of relating to people and being able to talk to them and gauge how a conversation will flow [to see if] they’re upset or figure out what they want to talk about; you can use [psychology] in so many different ways.”</p>\n<p>“Seeing the guys and the community in that way, you could see it was genuine grief. People were really going through it and it was a struggle for everyone. Naturally, when that happens, you start thinking about yourself and how you could’ve done better. Even though you might have not been directly in the situation, you start to think, ‘Man, I could have done that differently,’ and that could’ve changed somebody else’s life in a positive way.Unfortunately it had to happen in that way, but I think it was eye-opening and some people made some changes.”</p>\n<p>As a leader on this season’s team that included only one senior, the impact of the tragedy isn’t as evident. But, the fact that this year’s graduating class will be the last of the UCSB and Isla Vista communities that were in the areas during the incident is still very prevalent.</p>\n<p>“I think there has been an unbelievable amount of support, with the blue lights and the awareness around campus. But I feel like as one generation comes and goes and [with] this senior class being the last [group] that were really here for it, I think that plays a major role in it kind of [being] forgotten, which I hope it doesn’t because I hope that community can stay strong,” Vincent said. “A lot of universities have four years in, four years out, and it’s almost like a new culture or new tradition. I hope that’s something that can stay alive, and hopefully, through the different support systems on campus, they can keep the community strong together and let them know that things can happen, it doesn’t matter where you are. There’s been many other instances at universities, and I think that it’s important to not keep these things relevant but on your mind.”</p>\n<p>Whether or not time heals all wounds can only be determined by the individual. While the pain and disbelief of what took place on May 23, 2014, still causes grief for many, the recovery from this tragedy is still taking place and can be sustained with a communal effort.</p>\n<p>“I think Isla Vista is a special place. It’s right on the beach, it’s right next to campus. It’s a great diverse group, and I think it’s important to keep in mind, especially with this class leaving, and we have some younger guys on the team [who are like] ‘It’s the anniversary of what?’ and you can already kind of see it becoming forgotten,” Vincent said. “I don’t think it’s anything to run away from, the history of that [event], because you can’t change time. [Embracing] that and keeping the discussion open, be willing to talk about it and let people know what happened. Obviously you don’t want history to repeat itself; that’s the last thing this community could need or want.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78079\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78079\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/","id":1890,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1889,1888,1887],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ball Is Life.

However, various sports news leaders continue to give LaVar a platform to utilize. Whether it be him defending the $495 price tag of Lonzo’s signature shoe or him making comparisons to Steph Curry or LeBron James, headlines have constantly played into LaVar’s ploy.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, the “Big Baller Brand” head honcho has done a good job of utilizing the exposure he has received. He’s been the mastermind of a publicity stunt that has enabled him to put the “BBB” brand on a pedestal that some support or hate.</p>\n<p>While the pricing for the “ZO2” signature shoe is too high, I respect the vision of the family business. The plan to invest in yourself is genius. Why not have complete creative control over how you mold and develop your own brand?</p>\n<p>Some may consider it costly considering that Nike, Under Armour and Adidas each decided not to sign Lonzo to a shoe deal. But self-investment is something no other player has done, with the closest being LeBron James and his lifetime deal with Nike.</p>\n<p>The vision is clear, but the logistics behind the brand will have to be altered in order for it to grow in the years to come. How to do so isn’t exactly clear at the moment due to the fact that Lonzo has yet to be drafted and even play a game in the NBA.</p>\n<p>After a decision that likely included the input of LaVar for Lonzo to not participate in the NBA Combine, it is no surprise that Lonzo will only work out for the Lakers prior to the NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>These are the circumstances that have left me with mixed emotions regarding LaVar’s role in Lonzo’s transition to the NBA.</p>\n<p>Although LaVar’s intentions surely aren’t meant to devalue his son’s talents, he has steadily added pressure to the already daunting expectations Lonzo is entering the league with, especially if he ends up going to the Lakers, who are looking to solidify a franchise player who will end their decline of the past three years.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s unfair that people make claims in hopes of Lonzo being a bust or having an underwhelming career due to the actions of his father. Many presume that Lonzo’s laidback demeanor is a sign of submissiveness to his father or that of a kid who never had any say regarding his basketball career.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s the case or not cannot be determined.

His power hitting was responsible for seven of the Gauchos’ 18 runs over the span of the four contests. His current mark of 14 homeruns leads the Big West and surpassed his former career-high of 11 last season. Collectively, the Gauchos rank second in the conference with 41 homers.</p>\n<p>Although Bush has managed to carry the offensive load for UCSB as of late, the Gauchos’ pitching core has been the victim of allowing a slew of runs during games in which they started off well but could not sustain their play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s last three losses have included at least three allowed runs in a single inning. In the final game of its series against the Titans, UCSB allowed eight runs in the third, and in its weekday matchup against St. Mary’s it conceded nine runs in the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>The inconsistencies on the mound should be a cause of concern for the Gauchos as they prepare to face a Cal Poly team that thrives at the plate as it leads the conference in hits at 469 and is second in batting average with a .274 clip, on par with UCSB’s average.</p>\n<p>Hoping to capitalize on UCSB’s disappointing 5.15 ERA is the Mustangs’ sophomore outfielder Alex McKenna.</p>\n<p>Named to the Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American Team by <em>Collegiate Baseball Newspaper</em> in his freshman season, McKenna’s .357 hitting average ranks second-best in the Big West. Able to apply pressure when batting, he also is a threat when on-base as he is fifth in the conference with 12 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>What could be the most significant aspect of how the rivaled series will play out this weekend is the performance of the Mustangs’ pitching staff. More specifically, Cal Poly’s ability to not give up homeruns will be pivotal.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Mustangs have allowed a league-low 17 dingers and have been even more efficient during conference play with just four homeruns allowed.</p>\n<p>Setting the foundation to such a small allowance is Cal Poly’s heat on the mound as it sits atop the Big West with 410 strikeouts. Leading the Mustangs is the pitching duo of sophomore Spencer Howard and junior Erich Uelmen. Both rank second and third in the conference in strikeouts per nine innings as Howard averages 9.71 and Uelmen at 8.85, respectively.</p>\n<p>This past Saturday, Howard tallied Cal Poly’s first complete game of the season in a 5-2 win over CSUN. He threw 118 pitches, allowed seven hits, two earned runs and finished with 10 strikeouts. Uelmen has consistently held up his end as he has struck out 80 batters thus far, ranking third in the conference.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos possess the firepower to go hit-for-hit against Cal Poly, their fate ultimately comes down to how well they can challenge the Mustangs’ pitching.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry series will begin this Friday, May 19, at 3 p.m. The start time for Saturday’s game is 2 p.m., while Sunday’s closing game will begin at noon. All games will be played at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

\r\n</script> \n<p>Each celebratory scenario serves as a microcosm of the array of past and current African-American MLB players who have contributed to baseball becoming more inclusive and diverse.</p>\n<p>Although widely known for their legacies left on the baseball field, each of the aforementioned former black MLB players were integral influences in black communities nationwide, helping pave the way for African Americans and people of color both on and off the field by confirming that they belonged within “America’s game.”</p>\n<p>This season’s opening day rosters and disabled lists included a league-wide 8 percent of African American players, accounting for a total of 69 black players (via Bob Nightengale, <em>USA Today Sports</em>).</p>\n<p>Helping carry the torch within today’s cohort of black MLB players is Baltimore Orioles All-star center fielder Adam Jones, who has been known to use his social platform to express his thoughts on racial and social injustices.</p>\n<p>For instance, he stated that “baseball is a white man’s sport,” when referring to the MLB’s lack of support during ex-San Francisco 49ers’ quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s protest of the national anthem this past NFL season.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Jones shared his distraught emotions concerning the taunting of racial slurs, which he experienced when he was called the “n-word” and had a bag of peanuts thrown at him in game one of the Orioles-Red Sox series at Fenway Park.</p>\n<p>Since then, various apologies were issued to Jones by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, the Boston Red Sox organization and others in attempt to reduce the uproar caused by the select Boston fans who attacked Jones Monday night.</p>\n<p>The incident has ignited much speculation regarding the debate as to whether or not all cities are racist or if it is just certain citizens who hold discriminatory and unjust perceptions of minorities.</p>\n<p>Yet rather than seek a solution to this question, the biggest concern is how citizens, fans, the media and players will rationalize the hatred spewed toward Jones.</p>\n<p>The individuals responsible for their ill-advised behavior will rightly face consequences, but the issue at stake goes beyond just placing the blame upon a few “ignorant” or “uneducated” people.</p>\n<p>Jones’s experience was a reminder of the systemic racism that remains ingrained within society, impacting the sports realm as well.</p>\n<p>People critique this institutional structure and question, for example, “Well, if institutionalized racism exists, then why have these players been able to achieve such success and make it to the MLB?”</p>\n<p>That’s just the masking of the root issue at hand. Whether in society, sports, housing, education, jobs or any other industry, institutional racism must be acknowledged. A mutual understanding must be reached regarding the fact that there’s no single, concrete solution to a system that includes centuries of oppression.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, progress in sport has been made since the breaking of the color barrier, but that feat alone was and still is not the final verdict to racism in sports.</p>\n<p>The possibility to combat its systemic presence is plausible and is a work in progress. Both Boston fans and the Red Sox organization deserve credit for applauding Jones in his first at-bat appearance in Tuesday night’s game, while news surfaced on Wednesday that a fan was banned from Fenway Park for using a racial slur against another fan during Tuesday’s game.</p>\n<p>Understanding that this week’s incident won’t be the last of a minority athlete being racially discriminated against is frustrating and somewhat numbing as it is expected. However, it is important for each of us to keep the goal of achieving social justice at the forefront of our societal priorities.</p>\n<p>It begins with each of us individually, yet it evolves when combined with the influence of sports.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77591\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77591\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/","id":1886,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1885,1884,1883],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Gears Up for Summer Basketball Camps","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ucsb-mens-bball-camps.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ucsb-mens-bball-camps.jpg?resize=692%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Hoping to reestablish a winning culture both ona dn off the court, the UCSB men's basketball program revealed the significance of putting on events such as its upcoming summer camps.

Each camp day is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Adding incentive to the camps are the scheduled appearances of NBA guest speakers — current Detroit Pistons forward Stanley Johnson and Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon — who were both former University of Arizona stars during Pasternack’s tenure with the program.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to link Coach Pasternack’s former players at Arizona that have had a bunch of success,” Miller said. “Also, to show the community that those are the type of players that we’re looking to bring here: high quality, character kids that are successful on and off the court. It will be good for them to speak to the kids and let them know about basketball but also about taking care of business in the classroom and community.”</p>\n<p>The city of Santa Barbara is no stranger to NBA presence as it has developed into a basketball hub over the years.</p>\n<p>With teams such as the Sacramento Kings, Memphis Grizzlies, Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Lakers electing to have their training and minicamps at UCSB, Santa Barbara’s mellow, relaxing atmosphere has become a popular commodity amongst teams looking to work hard and develop genuine bonding.</p>\n<p>The P3 Sports Performance facility, located near the beach on the American Riviera, serves as one of the main offseason attractions to many players and teams relocating to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Defined as the “Peak Performance Project,” P3 has served as home for training and performance enhancement to an array of professional, amateur and out-of-state athletes.</p>\n<p>“With P3 being here, it’s huge for us because, NBA guys in general, we want them to come work out on our campus; we want them to come play in the gym. We want to bridge that gap,” Miller explained. “They’re all here and training, [which] is perfect because we’re less than 10 minutes away from P3. It’ll be good to be able to get NBA players to [UCSB], especially if they have time to come speak to the campers.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has even become home to the likes of Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan as the hosting location to each of their youth basketball camps.</p>\n<p>With plans to reinvent the culture of UCSB men’s basketball, the team’s staff is committed to taking the program beyond the court by establishing a universal influence amongst its supporters.</p>\n<p>“We want everyone here to see what Coach Pasternack is about,” Miller said. “He’s a big guy with the kids; his own son is going to be here, so he’ll be a camper, too. He really wants to show the community that it’s not just about winning games; there’s a bigger picture. If we can get the whole community involved, that’s great. That’s what we want to do, especially with these camps so [people] can get to know him and our staff.”</p>\n<p>Determined to utilize its resourceful platform at hand, the UCSB men’s basketball coaching staff is focused on reinventing Gaucho basketball with one primary influence: a love for the game.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77377\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77377\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-gears-up-for-summer-basketball-camps/","id":528,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[527,526,525],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Not Defined By the Dime: The Transformation of the 1","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=299%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=299%2C409&ssl=1","description":"The role of the point guard has managed to evolve heavily throughout the past decade leaving Sports Editor Sean White to examine those changes and how it has affected the NBA landscape.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As players evolve, so do the qualifications of their respective positions and roles.

What should be taken into full account when evaluating and labeling a point guard with what has become such an unpredictable status? Is it assists? Points? Plus/minus value? Postseason success/experience?</p>\n<p>No clear-cut answer prevails, and there’s no guarantee as to whether or not there will ever be one. Yet, the time is now to acknowledge and appreciate the mounting progression of the point guard earning more stardom in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The traditional approach of being a pass-first, low-scoring point no longer defines the coveted floor general. Although the fundamentals of being able to run and orchestrate the offense from the top of the key are still staples, the “one” has transformed into a more versatile entity within itself.</p>\n<p>While various elements, including the type of offensive/defensive systems implemented, player roles, scouting, coaching and executive responsibilities, each have an influence on player performance, point guards are reaching a new pinnacle of significance.</p>\n<p>NBA history has been rewritten following the milestones of point guards over the years.</p>\n<p>From Derrick Rose becoming the youngest NBA MVP ever to Steph Curry becoming the first ever unanimous NBA MVP in his second-straight winning of the award to Russell Westbrook breaking Oscar Robertson’s record by setting the new single-season triple-double record at 42, the NBA’s longtime “Where Amazing Happens” campaign seems to be most fittingly applied to today’s arsenal of point guards.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the 2017 NBA Draft — set to take place on June 22, 2017 — the point guard position is set to be the most coveted cohort of players on the board in the early portion of the first round.</p>\n<p>It is possible that five point guards — Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina — could be selected in the lottery, which would be the most since 1999.</p>\n<p>While the upcoming class of point guards will anticipate adding their own style to the game, the diverse makeup of today’s offensive leaders include a nostalgic nature as well.</p>\n<p>Reminiscent with the likes of legends Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Oscar Robertson, the notion of the “point forward” is even more relevant in the NBA today with the emergence of the aforementioned Antetokounmpo and James or the 76ers’ decision that Ben Simmons will run the point in his debut next season.</p>\n<p>Likely to be judged as oversized or too uncoordinated for the point position if viewed by the standards of the ABA or NBA’s early years, the developing trend of bigger, stronger and massively built players has changed the prototypical state of the point guard for the better.</p>\n<p>Just look at the hype and frenzy we all went into when then prospect 7-footer Thon Maker’s basketball highlight tape went viral on social media, with him coming up the court and performing AND-1 like, ankle-breaking crossovers while pulling up for shots from just about anywhere on the court.</p>\n<p>Surely there’s no way anyone could discredit the heart and talent of current playmakers like Chris Paul or Isaiah Thomas, who are on the shorter side of the height spectrum, but the existence of the “Space Jam” Monstars build (for lack of a better word) of players transitioning into point guards is fascinating and fun to watch.</p>\n<p>Despite the contrast in build and body frame, this same transition applies with players like James Harden, who was named the Houston Rockets’ point guard after the hiring of Mike D’Antoni and has exceled since then. He finished the 2016-17 NBA regular season with career highs in points per game, assists (11.2) and rebounds (8.1), leaving many in favor of him winning the NBA MVP award.</p>\n<p>With an ability to create his own shot and drain it from either short or long-range distances and drive and kill defenders off with his signature Euro-step or draw fouls, Harden’s skillset has been enhanced most by his improved vision on the court when scoring or finding open teammates.</p>\n<p>But the dynamic of the point guard doesn’t end with size, athleticism, scoring or passing ability; it also includes the slashing and aggressive nature of players such as potential NBA MVP Russell Westbrook and John Wall.</p>\n<p>Although everyone is entitled to and possesses their own liking for each style, the NBA point guard has become somewhat atypical due to the fact that it’s a position constantly redefining itself.</p>\n<p>With the NBA playoffs in full effect, all of the league’s top point guards are performing on the game’s biggest stage. It is time for us all to delay the “elite” discussion and appreciate what’s available at the moment before it’s too late, and all that’s remaining are game highlights and jerseys in the rafters.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77108\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77108\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/","id":1911,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1910,1909,1908],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Drug Policy Aims to Enhance and Cater to the Student Athlete Experience","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"According to the university’s intercollegiate athletics handbook, “The goal of UCSB’s Drug Education, Prevention and Testing Program is to promote a drug- and alcohol-free environment for the in...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>According to the university’s intercollegiate athletics handbook, “The goal of UCSB’s Drug Education, Prevention and Testing Program is to promote a drug- and alcohol-free environment for the intercollegiate competitive program.”</p>\n<p>While headlines and breaking news segments of substance abuse or other drug-related violations tend to have a negative connotation, there are various components that contribute to the formation and current state of athletic drug policies and procedures here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Something helpful to understand is that there is both NCAA drug testing policies and procedures, and there’s also institutional drug policies and procedures,” Deputy Athletics Director and Senior Woman Administrator Kelly Barsky explained. “In most cases they’re very much alike.

I think the NCAA put [the rules] in place for competitive equity [to] make sure there’s not drug use that then potentially enhances performance, which creates an inequity [on] the playing field,” Barsky said. “The institutional drug policies and procedures may provide some of that, but it’s also to provide support for student-athlete health and wellness.”</p>\n<p>It is this dimension of health and wellness that has distinguished the foundation of UCSB’s drug policies and procedures, aiding their emphasis on not leaving student-athletes in the position to come to conclusions through trial and error, but rather with “drug education, prevention and testing.”</p>\n<p>Although the Intercollegiate Athletics (ICA) building serves as most UCSB student-athletes’ sanctuary for their needs, ensuring that they are also aware of the multitude of on-campus resources is one of the primary components on Barsky’s agenda.</p>\n<p>“My primary function is to provide oversight and support to a lot of our internal components within the [athletics] department,” Barsky said. “[This includes] sports medicine, sport performance, our collaboration with academic services, NCAA compliance [and] student advisory council. Anything pertaining to providing internal support or collaboration with the student athlete experience.”</p>\n<p>Busy with practice, games, traveling, courses and catching up on homework to remain eligible for play all while trying to maintain a social life, the student-athlete experience includes an intensified form of the typical student’s yearn for balance and time for self.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77179\" style=\"width: 341px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=77179\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77179\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77179\" data-attachment-id=\"77179\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/drug-policty/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?fit=1583%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1583,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"drug policty\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?fit=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77179\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty-792x1024.jpg?resize=331%2C428\" alt=\"\" width=\"331\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 792w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?w=1583&amp;ssl=1 1583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The array of responsibilities can be overwhelmingly stressful, especially with the prevalence of peer pressure or the temptations that exist within Isla Vista that sometimes lead to violations and misconduct.</p>\n<p>An awareness of these temptations is necessary as student-athletes are provided with no timetable concerning the frequency of drug testing throughout the regular or off seasons.</p>\n<p>“The NCAA as well as the institutional drug policy has random testing dates,” Barsky said. “There’s no schedule or schedule per sport. We can be notified or student-athletes can be notified anytime that there will be a test within a 24-hour period. The [athletics] department works with Drug Free Sport, which is the same company that administers drug testing for the NCAA.”</p>\n<p>Although the NCAA lays out the foundation for institutions to follow, UCSB’s drug policy prides itself on providing student-athletes with resources that are not only primarily concerned with performance but the overall mental and physical health as well.</p>\n<p>“I think the institutional structure provides a little more support. Again, you’re still [subject to] year-round random selection, but if you’re selected and there’s a positive test, there’s a process for support and potentially rehabilitation,” Barsky said. “Your first sanction is to follow the process of working with the alcohol and drug program. A second positive [or more] will lead to sanctions within your playing season, but it’s also to provide and use counseling services. The NCAA doesn’t have those supports in place like we have as an institution.”</p>\n<p>“We use the drug testing policy as well as a lot of resources. Services such as student health, the alcohol and drug program and C.A.P.S. We try to use our resources to provide the best education to student-athletes about drugs, alcohol and choices in general. The policy is an accountability method to ensure that they are following and complying with the NCAA rules and mandates it takes to be a student-athlete.”</p>\n<p>Although Barsky and her staff cannot monitor student-athletes’ every choice and action, instilling drug policies and procedures that are educational and relying applicable information is significant to them considering the longevity of their health both now and in the future.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s intercollegiate athletics handbook concerning student-athlete drug policies and procedures can be found here:<em> http://ucsb.prestosports.com/general/2016-17/files/2016_17_UCSB_ICA_Drug_Education_and_Prevention_Program_Policy_and_Procedures_Final.pdf</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77178\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77178\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/","id":1908,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1907,1906,1905],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Nearly Have Game-Winner Sink, Suffer 56-55 Loss to LBSU in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-4-17_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-4-17_7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The quest for its 15th Big West title for the UCSB women's basketball team was ended over the weekend as the Gauchos were edged in their loss to Long Beach State.

Helping steer the 49ers’ scoring was senior point guard Anna Kim with four points during the stretch.</p>\n<p>Kim finished with a team-high 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting along with four rebounds, three assists, and one steal.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s lethargic start simply stemmed from its shots not falling. Although it managed to chip away at Long Beach’s lead as the game progressed, UCSB ended shooting 35.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Scoring the first basket for UCSB was redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman with a layup in the post. Despite outrebounding LBSU 41-28, Santa Barbara still had to counter the 49ers’ attempt to shut down the paint.</p>\n<p>Edelman recorded her ninth double-double of the season, her second of the Big West Tournament, with 14 points and tied her career-high of 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Getting down low was a challenge as UCSB went 3-of-14 from the field (21.4 percent) with Porter netting the final two scores from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Long Beach State’s defensive press was successful in disrupting UCSB’s pace on offense as the 49ers held the Gauchos scoreless for 4:36 of the final five minutes of the first quarter, allowing the Beach to take a 18-8 lead.</p>\n<p>A 10-4 run to open the second period sustained the 49ers’ double-figure lead, increasing it to 28-12 following a made jumpshot by senior guard Raven Benton to jumpstart the string of points. Benton had 12 points while going 5-of-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>With the momentum shifting in favor of Long Beach State, UCSB looked to trim its deficit after calling a timeout with 4:55 remaining before halftime.</p>\n<p>Providing the first step toward cutting the lead was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez with a long range make. On the Gauchos’ next possession, it was redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler with the defensive rebound and drive on the other end of the court for a layup that reduced UCSB’s deficit to 17-28.</p>\n<p>Another layup by Toler helped bring UCSB within a 10-point margin, but free-throws and a jumpshot by the 49ers’ Gigi Hascheff gave LBSU a 33-19 lead at the half.</p>\n<p>Giving LBSU its largest lead of 19 points was Kim with a make from behind the perimeter as the 49ers went up 38-19.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB remained focused and had a 16-2 scoring outburst that catapulted the team to possibly achieve the come from behind victory.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 36.4 percent and 25 percent from behind the three-point line in the quarter, UCSB’s defense helped to produce on the offensive side of the ball.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara held Long Beach State to just nine points as the 49ers went 3-of-16 (18.8 percent) and 1-of-6 from long range (16.7 percent).</p>\n<p>“It had to start with our defense,” Henrickson said. “We were active. I think we had more deflections in a five minute stretch than we did in the whole first half. That’s who we need to be consistently. We made the run because we started to guard.”</p>\n<p>The run included a 7-of-8 performance at the free-throw line, in which Toler knocked down her pair to ignite UCSB.</p>\n<p>Uplifting the Gauchos’ spirit was a made three-pointer by Porter to finally trim LBSU’s lead to single figures at 40-31.</p>\n<p>Both a pair of made free-throws by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and a make from three-point range by Hernandez led to UCSB’s deficit being 35-40. A trip to the free-throw line for LBSU’s Benton allowed the 49ers to take a 42-35 lead going into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to outscore the 49ers 20-14, the clutch emergence of senior forward Madison Montgomery for LBSU was pivotal to the game’s final result.</p>\n<p>Montgomery scored 10 of her 14 points in the final period, six of which came from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>But it was the best scoring quarter for UCSB who had a 63.6 field goal percentage and was able to gain a 51-49 lead with 2:27 remaining in regulation after a three-point make by Toler, who had nine of her game-high 16 points in the game’s last 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>However, responding with baskets after losing the lead twice was Montgomery with a layup and eventual three-pointer that led to a 54-53 lead for LBSU. Extending the lead to 56-53 was a layup by senior guard/forward Jewelyn Sawyer.</p>\n<p>Two trips to the free-throw line ended with Toler making 1-of-2 attempts at the line before UCSB was in the position of having the game’s final possession while facing a 55-56 deficit.</p>\n<p>Able to draw up a play following a replay review, UCSB made sure it got the ball to its ‘go-to’ player in Porter, whose shot didn’t fall just seconds before the final play clock buzzed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-12/gauchos-nearly-have-game-winner-sink-endure-56-55-loss-to-lbsu-in-big-west-championship/","id":530,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[529,528,527],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Pulls Off Upset Over No. 1 Seed UC Davis, Face LBSU on Saturday in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-12-at-1.15.38-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-12-at-1.15.38-PM.png?resize=804%2C470&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team continues to inch closer to claiming its 15th Big West title after defeating UC Davis.

It’s been a long road so to just have the opportunity to play in the championship is mind blowing. I never pictured we would be here, but here we are,” senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe said.</p>\n<p>Following the career performance their teammate Sarah Porter the previous night, both Jemerigbe and redshirt junior guard Drea Toler emerged as the Gauchos’ leading scorers en route to their win over the conference title favorite.</p>\n<p>The backcourt duo combined for 44 points. Jemerigbe recorded a new career-high in points with 21. Toler’s 23 points was also a new career-high as she was responsible for all 23 of UCSB’s bench points, helping the Gauchos outscore UC Davis 23-2 in the statistical category. Her 10 made field goal off 17 shot attempts also is a career best mark.</p>\n<p>“The energy Drea and Onome provided us on the defensive end and how much they attacked and got to the rim was the difference offensively, “Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson explained.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 10-for-10 shooting performance in the third quarter was the game’s deciding factor, forcing the Aggies to play catch-up against a streaking Gauchos team. Santa Barbara ended Friday with a 50 percent field goal percentage (27-of-54) and 42.9 three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>After earning a bye in the first two rounds of the Big West Tournament, UC Davis came out of the gates looking like a team that was possibly on its way to a blowout victory. It gained a 7-0 lead through nearly three and a half minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Helping create the early lead was both junior guard Rachel Nagel and redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch. As one of the topm post players in the Big West, Bertsch scored the Aggies’ first basket. The scoring stretch also included a three-pointer by the team’s sharpshooter in Nagel, who finished with a team-high 18 points.</p>\n<p>Despite allowing the Aggies to shoot 42. 9 percent, UCSB held their star play in Bertsch to just 12 points on 4-of-9 shooting before eventually fouling out in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>“We just felt like we needed to defend in transition, because Bertsch rim runs as well as anybody,” Henrickson said. “Even though we lost to them earlier, we felt confident if we could get another shot and defend them in transition we would at least give ourselves a shot to be successful. That was much better for us tonight.”</p>\n<p>Coming out of a timeout, UCSB managed to recuperate along with the help of subbing in Toler, who scored four-straight points off go-ahead layups. Knotting the score at seven apiece was Porter with a three-pointer.</p>\n<p>Joining Toler was Jemerigbe with drives to the paint to give the Gauchos their first lead of the game at 11-9. Back and forth scoring between the two teams led to a 15-13 lead for UC Davis after a made jump shot by Nagel.</p>\n<p>The pace of play would slow down with both teams exchanging scores as ties and lead changes occurred. A three-point differential was the largest margin between the two.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 seconds remaining, Porter knocked down a shot from beyond the arc to put UCSB up 29-27. But a made halfcourt shot to beat the buzzer by Nagel gave UC Davis a 30-29 lead going into the half.</p>\n<p>With both teams vying for momentum, the third quarter worked in favor of UCSB outscoring UC Davis 23-15.</p>\n<p>A 7-0 run with contributions from Toler, redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman, and capped off by a made three-pointer by Jemerigbe propelled UCSB to a 40-34 lead. Edelman finished scored nine of her 12 points in the quarter as she concluded with a 4-of-7 shooting and four rebound night.</p>\n<p>Complementing Edelman was Jemerigbe with 10 of her 21 points in the period. The senior scored the team’s only two three-pointers during the quarter and ended it with a layup that increased UCSB’s lead to 52-45 heading into the final 10 minutes of regulation.</p>\n<p>A three-pointer by junior guard/forward Dani Nafekh cut the Gauchos’ lead to 59-54, bringing Davis within its smallest deficit of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Yet, an 8-2 scoring stretch sparked by a long range make by Toler which ended with a three-pointer by sophomore guard Coco Miller led to a 67-56 UCSB lead with 2:50 remaining.</p>\n<p>It would not be enough time for an Aggie comeback as a steal and go-ahead layup by Toler provided the finishing touch to UCSB securing its semifinal victory before closing with Porter at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Long Beach State will play Saturday, March 11 at 4 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim. The game will be nationally televised on Fox Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-11/ucsb-pulls-off-upset-over-no-1-seed-uc-davis-face-lbsu-on-saturday-in-big-west-championship/","id":529,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[528,527,526],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Porter Etches Name in UCSB and Big West History in UCSB Quarterfinal Win Over UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-1.48.07-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-1.48.07-PM.png?resize=798%2C402&ssl=1","description":"Big-time player show up in big-time games.

Whether when coming off screens, off the dribble or even contested, Porter’s hot shooting hand was consistent as she made 6-of-6 three-pointers and two free-throws in the game’s first 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Balancing Porter’s three-point shooting was redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman with a dominant performance in the paint. For a third time this season, Edelman tied her career-high of 22 points. Also, Edelman’s game-high 14 rebounds led to her tallying her eighth double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Signs of Porter’s career night began with her scoring the game’s first basket form long range. From that point on, both teams exchanged scores. Responding on UCR’s behalf was Malou Thiebaut De Kergret with a made three-pointer to give the Highlanders a 10-8 lead. The sophomore forward had 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting before fouling out later on.</p>\n<p>The one-point deficit was the last time UCSB trailed before responding with a 15-0 run. Sparking the run was Porter with her third-straight three-pointer at the 4:53 mark of the first. The Gauchos’ lead increased from a layup by redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler to 23-10, leading to UCR calling a timeout as it had been held scoreless for a little over five minutes.</p>\n<p>Toler concluded Wednesday night with 13 points, eight assists, and two steals.</p>\n<p>Breaking the Highlanders’ scoring slump was a jumpshot by junior guard Michelle Curry. Junior guard Lauren Holt scored on UCR’s next possession to cut their deficit to single digits at 14-23.</p>\n<p>But another three-pointer by Porter in the final five second of the first quarter gave UCSB a 26-14 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite being down to start the second quarter, Curry took matters into her own hands, embarking on an individual 8-2 run that cut UCSB’s lead to 28-22. She scored 11 of her team-high 22 points in the period.</p>\n<p>Although Riverside managed to contain Porter’s perimeter shooting during the quarter, holding her to just one missed shot attempt, UCSB responded with a 7-2 run of its own. The scoring stretch built its lead to 35-24.</p>\n<p>UCR cut the Gaucho’s lead to a five-point deficit three times during the period as a made free-throw by Curry left the Highlanders down 37-42 entering halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the game with a 40-26 advantage in both rebounds and points in the paint. The outcome of both values led to Edelman’s big night, which picked up at the start of the second half as she scored the Gauchos first six points of the third.</p>\n<p>Still, the Highlanders continued to claw away at Santa Barbara’s lead. After Curry’s jumpshot brought UCR within three at 48-51 before a layup by UCSB’s Toler, Kergret knocked down a three-pointer on Riverside’s next possession that resulted in a 51-53 deficit with 4:49 remaining in the third.</p>\n<p>As UCSB was in a position of possibly losing its lead, emerging was Porter from beyond the arc to give it a 56-51 lead. Igniting the Gaucho’s 11-4 run to end the period was a three-pointer by freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez. Toler scored the team’s last field goal with a layup, helping UCSB enter the fourth with a 67-59 lead.</p>\n<p>Similar to how the game began, Edelman and Porter scored UCSB’s first points in the game’s final period to put the Gauchos up 72-61.</p>\n<p>Porter scored her coveted ninth three-pointer of the game with 5:18 remaining, giving UCSB a 77-63 lead. Both teams would end up trading baskets and taking trips to the free-throw line with Edelman scoring the Gauchos’ last field goal of the game to eventually lock up their victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Davis this Friday, March 10 in the semifinal round of the Big West Tournament at noon. ESPN3 will provide coverage of the game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76385\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-10/porter-arches-name-in-ucsb-and-big-west-history-in-ucsb-quarterfinal-win-over-ucr/","id":517,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[516,515,514],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Uncharted Destiny: Toler & Porter Find Best Fit in UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-17-at-1.53.31-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-17-at-1.53.31-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Any amount of time spent away from a sport is one of the most difficult experiences a student-athlete can endure.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Despite being California natives, Toler from Inglewood and Porter from San Diego, the decision to pack things up and come to Santa Barbara was not a simple sign-and-release process.</p>\n<p>As roommates and members of the Gauchos’ backcourt, Toler and Porter both sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules.</p>\n<p>According to <em>ncaa.org</em>, “Under the basic transfer regulations, you must spend an academic year in residence at the school to which you are transferring.”</p>\n<p>Both players redshirted last season, giving Toler her current redshirt junior status while Porter still has two years remaining as a redshirt sophomore.</p>\n<p>Toler transferred from the University of Oregon, while Porter spent her first year of her collegiate career at the University of Mississippi, but this doesn’t tell all about their past experiences.</p>\n<p>Although both could participate in team practices and dress for play, the regulation prohibited the two from playing during the regular season and postseason, leaving them anxious and eager on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Toler expressed that it “was beneficial in being able to learn, but tough in being limited to only cheering for teammates and not being able to actually play.”</p>\n<p>Expressing similar sentiments to her teammate, Porter assured that although it was a learning experience it was also “bittersweet because of the inability to play the game I love.”</p>\n<p>Before making the transition to UCSB, the start to each of their careers was not a structured beginning when looking back at their recruiting experiences.</p>\n<p>The recruiting process can be one full of clouded judgment as the constant phone calls, visits and promises can either enhance or deter one from making the most suitable decision.</p>\n<p>The current state of the recruitment process has been shifted over the years as out-of-state universities now make more of an effort to recruit student athletes from all over the country. The response to the search has been kind as players are intrigued by the thought of a change in scenery.</p>\n<p>Even so, this change hasn’t always warranted a promising outcome. It tends to only scratch the surface, showing what’s most appealing to the eye, sometimes leading student athletes to make questionable decisions.</p>\n<p>Although Toler ended up staying on the West Coast for her first two years of college, the journey to becoming a duck wasn’t a pre-determined destination.</p>\n<p>“Coming out of high school was hard. When I first came out, I actually committed to Sarah’s school, Ole Miss. It was the first school I went to and I just committed without knowing too much about it. I feel like that was more of a freshman thing to do.”</p>\n<p>The period of uncertainty led to Toler’s eventual commitment to Oregon. A change in head coaches between her freshman and sophomore seasons, however, influenced her decision to leave the school.</p>\n<p>Despite her undersized frame, Toler’s speed, ability to drive and court vision were each areas of her game which she believed UCSB catered to, making this the next best school for her.</p>\n<p>“Once I came [to UCSB], it was different because I knew what to look for [regarding] the coaching, type of system and what the school offered academic-wise,” Toler said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a coveted high school career helped build up Porter’s reputation, who became well-known for her scoring ability, as she left Horizon Christian Academy as a member of its 1,000-point club with 1,292 points.</p>\n<p>“I actually originally committed to Fresno State coming out of high school, but the coaches left, so I reopened my recruiting process,” Porter explained. “Ole Miss sounded amazing to me, [but] I kind of went blind into the situation because I didn’t know the coaches that well, which is why it ended up not working out.”</p>\n<p>In the cases of Toler and Porter, it is plausible that the prestige of each of their former universities being within Power Five conferences set the stage for where they thought their future resided.</p>\n<p>After beginning the season on the bench, Porter’s consistency as the Gauchos’ go-to shooter helped land her within the starting lineup as a stretch guard/forward.</p>\n<p>“The third time around, I knew what I wanted to look for,” Porter said. “I wanted to come to a school where I felt comfortable with the coaching staff, the academics were good and they had everything they needed to offer me.”</p>\n<p>Following the end of last season, in which only three seniors graduated, it was a wonder as to how exactly either player would fit into a team with four of its starters returning.</p>\n<p>Understanding that there are no guarantees, especially pertaining to the court, Toler and Porter have certainly answered any concerns prior to entering this season.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping UCSB capture the No. 4 seed and a first-round bye in the Big West Tournament, each player confirmed the anticipation that surrounded them following their redshirt seasons.</p>\n<p>Toler ended the regular season tied for the conference lead in assists per game with a 4.4 average. Primarily coming off the bench, Toler finished atop the Big West in assists per 40 minutes at 8.3 as well. She also ranked second-best on the team in scoring in conference games at 10.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Porter was another valuable piece as her three-point shooting led to her being one of the top perimeter shooters in the Big West. Her 38.1 three-point percentage during the regular season ranked seventh. Most notably, she placed third in the conference in total three-pointers made with 61, which currently ranks sixth most in a single-season in UCSB history.</p>\n<p>It was unfortunate that the two were forced to sit out during the hype of the hiring of Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson.

It’s all or nothing now, the momentum we have from this game will hopefully roll over to the next.”</p>\n<p>In one of the game’s most critical moments, it was Jemerigbe’s made three-pointer with nearly six minutes left in the game that prevented a surging Cal Poly team from possibly completing a comeback.</p>\n<p>Along with Jemerigbe, both senior forward Mi’Chael Wright and senior center Melissa Maragnes were celebrated for Senior Night.</p>\n<p>Shifting the game in Santa Barbara’s advantage were runs to close the first half and open the second before Cal Poly embarked on its fourth quarter comeback, cutting the Gauchos lead to six before coming up short.</p>\n<p>It was a highly energized atmosphere inside the Thunderdome with conference tournament seeding at stake. Nonetheless, both teams traded baskets in reflection of the game’s intense pace.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead which included a basket by junior guard Lynn Leaupepe, who scored a game-high 24 points but could never establish any consistency as she shot 9-of-22 and 4-of-10 from long range.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struck with a balanced attack, first going to redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman in the paint, then from behind the three-point line with redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter for a 5-4 lead. It was a start that led to a 15-3 run that before Lynn Leaupepe scored five-straight points to end the quarter as Cal Poly trailed 15-12.</p>\n<p>Porter continued to warm up from deep with two three-pointers in the first to minutes of the second quarter. The Gauchos’ shooter scored eight of the team’s first 10 points.</p>\n<p>It was Porter’s most productive period as she tallied 10 of her 13 points during the period, and ended the game 4-of-7 from the field and 3-of-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Yet, tying the game at 25 apiece with a three-pointer was junior guard/forward Mary Kate Evans for her only field goal off the bench.</p>\n<p>The tie wouldn’t last long once UCSB put together its 12-3 run before halftime. Half of the Gauchos points were scored at the free-throw line. Also responsible for half of the points lodged was Jemerigbe as her two made free-throws handed UCSB a 37-28 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>With momentum already going UCSB’s way, the opening minutes of the third quarter belonged solely to the Gauchos as they constructed a 16-6 run.</p>\n<p>The scoring stretch began with the draining of a three-pointer by Jemerigbe to give UCSB its first double-figure lead of the game at 40-30.</p>\n<p>Helping Cal Poly chip at the Gauchos’ lead was senior forward Hannah Gilbert as she scored seven points and went a perfect 3-of-3 from the field in the quarter. Overall, Gilbert shot 50 percent (5-of-10) and ended the game with 12 points, four rebounds, one block, and one steal.</p>\n<p>But Santa Barbara’s scoring outburst proved to be too much as its bench emerged as well. The combination of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler’s drive and kick ability along with freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez’ perimeter shooting helped run up the score on UCSB’s end.</p>\n<p>The two scored six apiece, and it was Hernandez’ made three-pointer at the 4:17 mark of the third that gave UCSB a 53-34 lead as it seemed destined to route its Blue-Green rival.</p>\n<p>Toler finished with 15 points and a game-high seven assists, while Hernandez ended with six points.</p>\n<p>Despite its 19-point deficit, Cal Poly still showed signs trying to curtail UCSB’s growing lead. Junior guard Dynn Leaupepe complemented her sister’s scoring with seven-straight points during the third quarter but it would not be enough still. Her final results to the game were 16 points and five rebounds while going 7-of-16, 2-of-4 from long distance.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s ability to hold the sisters to inefficient shooting nights was key in its defense holding Cal Poly to percentages of 38.5 from the field and 35 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>“We held them to 40, they had 55 last time. Good heavens they’re good. There’s not much you can do with a midrange game,” Henrickson explained. “We tried to keep them on one side of the floor. [On Friday] we played some things live, which we don’t normally a lot. Every assistant had a stat. What are their numbers, percentages, zone numbers? At the end of the day, the players have got to buy in. We [had] to play the percentages and we did.”</p>\n<p>Yet, a quick 8-1 run helped the Mustangs trim UCSB’s lead to 62-49 heading into the fourth. It set the stage for their dominant start to the game’s final 10 minutes as they then went on a 9-2 run, bringing its deficit to 64-58 with 6:08 remaining following steal and made layup by Lynn Leaupepe.</p>\n<p>With UCSB’s lead being jeaopardized, Jemerigbe prevailed with a three-pointer to give UCSB some comfort. Regaining the Gauchos’ double-figure lead of 69-58 was a made layup by Toler.</p>\n<p>From that point on, UCSB scored one last field goal and scored the remainder of its points at the free-throw line where it finished 19-of-26.</p>\n<p>Ending the season at home and with a two-game winning streak is momentous for a Gaucho team preparing for March Madness beginning with the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Wednesday against the remaining highest seed at 8:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/","id":506,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[505,504,503],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Prevail For 71-53 Victory In Return Home, Can Secure No. 4 Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=980%2C636&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team is in the position to lock up home court after its win over UC Irvine Thursday night.

Everybody has something at stake; all the small things that give you a chance to be successful, we’ve positioned ourselves to at least give ourselves a chance. That doesn’t happen Saturday, that happens over the course of the season.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Able to end a three-game slump in their return home, the Gauchos improved to 13-15 and 8-7 in the Big West. It was the opposite for UCI as it endured its third consecutive defeat in its final road game of the season, making the Anteaters 4-25, 2-13 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s plan to feed forward Drew Edelman the ball in the paint was evident from the game’s beginning as she finished the game one-point shy of tying her career-high with a game-high 21 points along with tallying a career-high 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[UCI] started with a smaller lineup. Since they didn’t start with their [usual lineup], it was a much easier target for the guards to hit,” Edelman said. “They were lobbing me perfect passes, so we connected well.</p>\n<p>UCSB outscored UC Irvine 24-6 in the paint and grabbed a total of 47 rebounds – its most in a conference game this season.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s dominance in the paint freed up space along the perimeter, allowing sophomore guard Coco Miller to emerge. Miller recorded 14 points as all four of her made field goals came from behind the three-point line where she shot 4-of-5.</p>\n<p>“[UCI] can’t stop everything. So if they stop the inside, [then] we have the open three,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Both Edelman and Miller ended the first half with a combined 23 points. The Gauchos’ frontcourt leader in Edelman scored the team’s first six points, which was the start to her 9-of-12 shooting night.</p>\n<p>Having entered the Thunderdome as the top three-point shooting team in the Big West, UC Irvine established its perimeter focus right away as half of its field goals in the first half (6-of-16) were made from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Irvine’s first five shot attempts of the game came from long range. Knocking down the Anteaters’ first three-point attempt was sophomore guard Andee Ritter to give UCI a 3-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Able to increase her program single-season record of made three-pointers to 81 after Thursday night, Ritter had 16 points but was couldn’t establish a shooting rhythm as she finished 5-of-18 from the field and 2-of-9 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>It was an efficient shooting start for UCSB as it shot 50 percent from the field. But the Anteaters stuck around as the two teams exchanged scores to end the first tied at 17 apiece.</p>\n<p>The trading of baskets didn’t last long as the Gauchos opened the second quarter with a 15-0 run to take a 32-17 lead.</p>\n<p>Back-to-back three-pointers by Miller and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter triggered the string of points.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos’ dominance in the paint led to UCI getting into the foul bonus nearly halfway through the second. Making 10-of-12 free-throws in during the period, UCSB had one of its best free-throw shooting nights, finishing 17-of-21.</p>\n<p>It was not until the 4:50 mark that the Anteaters scored their first field goal as a result of a made three-pointer by senior guard Irene Chavez. She then hit another shot from long distance to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 33-23.</p>\n<p>Chavez tied Ritter’s team-high 16 points but was more efficient from behind the three-point line, where she scored all 5-of-11 of her field goals.</p>\n<p>Her two shots from long distance were the Anteaters only two baskets of the quarter as they were outscored 18-6 in the quarter and trailed 35-23 at the half.</p>\n<p>UCSB pieced together a 10-3 run to open the third quarter and earned its largest lead of 19-points after a made three-pointer by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe to increase the Gauchos’ lead to 45-26. Jemerigbe seven points, six rebounds, and a game-high seven assists.</p>\n<p>Each time it seemed like UC Irvine was ruled out, it was Chavez who emerged with pivotal scoring to keep the Anteaters in the game. With 4:10 remaining in the third, Chavez started and ended UCI’s 13-6 run with three-pointers to trim its deficit to 53-42.</p>\n<p>A made jump shot by senior forward Piper McKenzie and a pair of made free-throws by senior forward Brittany Glassow brought the Gauchos’ lead to single figures as Irvine trailed 53-46. Eventually, a set of made free-throws by Ritter made UCI’s comeback attempt more plausible as it trailed by five, 56-51 with 5:11 remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>But the Anteaters’ rally ended quickly once UCSB established its 15-2 run to close the game. While UCI struggled on offense with a 21.4 shooting percentage, the Gauchos prevailed from the field at 50 percent to lock up the win.</p>\n<p>After its win, only the task to win its next game lies ahead of UCSB. It will hope to secure the No. 4 seed on Saturday, March 4 against Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76185\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76185\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/hauchos-prevail-for-71-53-victory-in-return-home-can-secure-no-4-seed/","id":513,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[512,511,510],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Battling For Big West Tournament Seeding","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=980%2C636&ssl=1","description":"The month of March is finally upon us, nearly guaranteeing some of the best college basketball all season.

The Gauchos have a chance to win the season series over UC Irvine in back-to-back seasons.</p>\n<p>Dating back to when the two programs first faced each other on Jan. 28, UCSB recorded a program-high 15 made three-pointers and finished with season highs in points (85), field goal percentage (55.4) and win differential (25 points), all while tying its best three-point percentage (50).</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos’ three-point barrage was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez. She finished with career highs of 22 points and seven made three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Since setting the new record, UCSB had struggled from beyond the arc, but seems to be getting back on track as it has shot over 30 percent from deep in two of its last three games in which it has made at least seven threes.</p>\n<p>While Thursday could potentially be the game to reignite the Gauchos’ perimeter shot, it is also an opportunity for them to improve upon their ball movement and pace on offense.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara tallied a season-high 23 assists in its win over UC Irvine. The success from three-point land may have led to UCSB becoming too comfortable from deep as its sharing of the ball decreased.</p>\n<p>In four of seven games, UCSB has recorded 20-plus three-point attempts and has had less than 20 assists in all seven contests.</p>\n<p>Despite the statistics showing a decline, the Gauchos still own one of the best passing backcourts in the conference. Both point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior Drea Toler rank top five in total assists in the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>Toler leads all players with 118, while Jemerigbe is fifth with 103. Both remain in the top five in assists per game as well with Toler in third with a 4.4 average and Jemerigbe with a 3.8 average, respectively.</p>\n<p>Success from behind the three-point line is influential on both sides as UC Irvine has become one of the top long-range shooting teams in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are coming off setting a program high of 15 made three pointers in their loss to Long Beach State on Saturday. Senior guard Irene Chavez and sophomore guard Andee Ritter combined for 41 points and were responsible for 12 of the team’s three-pointers. Both knocked down six trey balls, marking a career high for Chavez.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Ritter has made strides all season long as she currently leads the Big West in total threes and steals at 79 and 62, respectively. She is the only Anteater ever to make at least 70 three-pointers in a season.</p>\n<p>UCI holds a Big West-leading 38.2 three-point percentage through conference play and is second in made three pointers with 107.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the Cal Poly matchup, Saturday has the potential to be very intense as the two could be battling it out for a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will be in search of repeating last season’s series sweep after defeating the Gauchos 78-67 on the conference’s opening day.</p>\n<p>Currently on a two-game losing streak, Cal Poly is led by junior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who is the team’s leading scorer at 15 points per game, good for fifth in the Big West. She has tallied 20-plus points in three consecutive games and four of the Mustangs’ last five contests.</p>\n<p>Earning a season-high 29 points against UCSB earlier this season, Leaupepe will be the center of attention for the Gauchos’ defense as she has attempted a combined 48 shots in the team’s last two games.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s promising start diminished as the season progressed, it still has a chance to end the season with a first-round bye for the first time since the 2010-11 season.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and UC Irvine will be Thursday, March 2 at 7 p.m. Santa Barbara will face Cal Poly on Saturday, March 4 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76098\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76098\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/gauchos-battling-for-big-west-tournament-seeding/","id":504,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[503,502,501],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":12,"route":"/authors/45"}},"__N_SSG":true}
