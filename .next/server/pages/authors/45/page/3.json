UCSB’s continuous slump lands it at fifth place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>The likelihood of UC Davis locking up the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament increased over the weekend as it earned its eighth-straight victory to improve to 21-6, 12-2. Able to sustain its first-place rank in the conference, the Aggies’ streak is their longest since winning nine consecutive games during the 2005-06 season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to its matchup versus UCSB, UC Davis had shot 50 percent or above from the field in its last two games. The Aggies’ hot shooting continued against the Gauchos as they ended the game a shade below the aforementioned mark at 49 percent on 25-of-51 shooting, but they made up for it from beyond the arc, making 10-of-20, a major contrast to their 2-of-16 finish in the first meeting.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman recorded her sixth double-double of the season as she led the Gauchos in scoring with 17 points and a game-high 10 rebounds. She finished 5-of-8 from the field and 7-of-7 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Two leads as the teams traded baskets in the opening minutes were UCSB’s only leads during the game.</p>\n<p>Trailing 4-5, UC Davis made an 8-0 run that kickstarted the Aggies, who extended their lead as the game progressed.</p>\n<p>Igniting the scoring stretch was sophomore guard Kourtney Eaton with a midrange jump shot. Never losing its lead after the field goal, UC Davis added to its lead with back-to-back made three-pointers by junior forward Pele Gianotti and junior guard/forward Dani Nafekh on its next two possessions to take a 11-4 lead.</p>\n<p>Gianotti concluded Saturday with a game-high 19 points, going 6-of-12 from the field, 3-of-7 from long range and 4-of-4 at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>A quick layup by Edelman helped UCSB trim Davis’s lead to 13-7 at the end of the period.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting just 34.8 percent from behind the perimeter (8-of-23), it was an improved shooting performance for the Gauchos, as it was their most made three-pointers since creating a new program record on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Coco Miller knocked down more than half of UCSB’s three-pointers, scoring the Gauchos’ first two field goals in the second quarter from downtown to cut their deficit to 13-18. Scoring each of her field goals from deep, Miller tallied 15 points on 5-of-12 and 5-of-9 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>After tying her career high of 27 points in the first game against UCSB, it was expected that redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch would be the Gauchos’ main concern.</p>\n<p>Both Miller and Bertsch played pivotal roles in the second quarter; it was the game’s highest scoring period, with UC Davis taking a 26-21 advantage.</p>\n<p>Miller scored 12 of her 15 points in the period on 4-of-6 shooting, while Bertsch scored 11 points and missed just one shot attempt as she went 5-of-6.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara held the potential Big West Player of the Year to 15 points, Bertsch was efficient with her shot selection as she finished the game 7-of-13 from the field. Her seven-straight points beginning at the 7:36 mark of the second period captured UC Davis’s first double-figure lead of the game at 25-13.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to come within a nine-point deficit after a made three-pointer by Miller, trailing 30-21, but could not contain the Aggies’ streaky shooting of 76.9 percent and entered halftime down 39-27.</p>\n<p>Edelman scored the Gauchos’ first six points of the second half, yet it was their worst shooting quarter; they shot a horrid 18.8 percent from the field (3-of-16) and went 0-of-7 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB once again trimmed UCD’s lead to nine points at 33-42 after a pair of made free throws by Edelman.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ comeback efforts were halted as UC Davis embarked on a 10-2 run to close out the third with its largest lead of the game, 52-35.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, UCSB performed best during the fourth quarter, outscoring the Aggies 26-18. It recorded a 56.3 field goal percentage and shot 50 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>While Edelman padded her stats with eight points in the quarter, redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler was vital during the Gauchos’ late spurt, scoring nine of her 13 points.</p>\n<p>All nine points occurred in the game’s final three minutes, during which at one point she trimmed UC Davis’ lead to 63-56 with 1:36 remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the Aggies’ clutch free-throw shooting — making 10-of-12 — led to them securing their victory in their final home game of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return home for its final two games of the season.

The Aggies have won six consecutive games as their 19-6, 10-2 record matches their finish from last season.</p>\n<p>Holding a one-game lead for first place over Long Beach State, which is responsible for its two conference losses, UC Davis will play Cal Poly before hosting UCSB in its final home game of the year. If UCD manages to win its seventh straight, it would tie the longest streak in the program’s Division I history set back in both 2008 and 2010.</p>\n<p>The path to upsetting the Aggies will begin with the Gauchos’ ability to protect the ball. UCSB is coming off a season-high 26 turnovers in its loss to Long Beach State, in which it was outscored 35-13 in points off turnovers. It was the sixth time this season the Gauchos turned the ball over 20-plus times, but the first since Dec. 19 in their win over Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi.</p>\n<p>While the defensive pressure of opposing teams must be accredited, oftentimes UCSB’s turnover troubles result from self-inflicted mistakes such as forcing passes in the lane and paint that result in steals, wasted possessions that go out of bounds or the mishandling of passes.</p>\n<p>During the team’s 1-4 standing in its last five games, UCSB has continuously struggled with its three-point shooting. Over the span of games, Santa Barbara has accumulated a 21.4 average from behind three-point line, finishing with an 11.8 percentage in its last game after a 2-for-17 finish from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could use an improved three-point shooting performance from redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting a Big West fifth-best 39.2 percent from three-point land and having the third-most made three-pointers in the conference at 56, Porter has only shown glimpses of her once consistent long range shooting.</p>\n<p>She began the Gauchos’ five game slide with a disturbing zero points and 0-of-8 shooting outing and hasn’t been able to make much progress since. Currently shooting 25.6 percent from behind the perimeter, Porter has only managed to achieve double figures in scoring twice, and she is coming off her second-lowest career total of two points.</p>\n<p>Still, the team’s go-to scorer remains a primary option as her 56 made three-pointers are tied for sixth-most in a single season in UCSB women’s basketball history. If Porter can manage to get the three ball to fall, it could be very beneficial as the Gauchos are 6-1 during conference play when she makes three or more three-point baskets.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to capitalize upon any scoring opportunity it can get as it prepares to face arguably the most dynamic team in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UC Davis, who last won a Big West title in 2011, has made itself one of the conference’s few teams favored to lock up the No. 1 seed and possibly win the Big West Tournament. Another win could have major implications as the 2010-11 season also was UCD’s last 20-win season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies lead in just about every imaginable statistical category with outstanding averages in points per game (69.8), points allowed per game (60), field goal percentage (44.3), three-point percentage (35.3), defensive three-point percentage (27.5), defensive field goal percentage (35.3), turnovers committed per game (13.6) and assists per game (16.8).</p>\n<p>Davis is one of three Big West teams this season to hand UCSB its largest deficit in a loss of 14 points. The two teams last met on Feb. 4 when redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch tied her career-high of 27 points to lead the Aggies to a 62-48 victory.</p>\n<p>Bertsch currently ranks third in points per game and fourth in field goal percentage in the Big West with averages of 16.7 and 52.7, respectively. Three of her eight 20-point games this season have occurred in the Aggies’ past four games.</p>\n<p>As the team’s top scorer, Bertsch is able to score in the paint and stretch the floor with her midrange shooting, benefiting from behind the perimeter is the junior duo of forwards Pele Gianotti and Dani Nafekh.</p>\n<p>The pair of long range sharpshooters complete Davis’ trio of double figure scorers with Nafekh averaging 11.3 PPG and Gianotti at 10.6 PPG. Both are within the top five in the Big West in three-point percentage, as Nafekh sits atop the conference at 46.5 percent while Gianotti is sixth at 38.5 percent.</p>\n<p>UCSB held UC Davis to a 12.5 three-point percentage earlier in the month on 2-of-16 shooting.</p>\n<p>Upsetting the Aggies at home will be a difficult task as they have won 14 of their last 17 home games. Most notably, they have not trailed in a game since the second quarter of their win over Cal State Fullerton back on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Despite facing arguably the best team in the Big West, UCSB must focus on its defensive approach as that will help it produce on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tip off at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 25 at the Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75914\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75914\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/","id":251,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[250,249,248],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Road Voyage Continues, Face UCR and LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-11.50.32-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-11.50.32-AM.png?resize=978%2C608&ssl=1","description":"After picking up a win in the first game of its four-game road trip, the UCSB women's basketball team will remain on the road this Thursday and Saturday.

UCSB is seeking its first win against UCR since the Jan. 23 of the 2013-14 season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to Saturday’s victory, redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman had just one double-figure scoring performance in UCSB’s last five games. In addition to the one game, in which she had 14 points, she had recorded no more than six field goal attempts.</p>\n<p>When Edelman has at least 10 or more shot attempts in a game, the Gauchos are 6-1. She is coming off posting career-high in points and assists with 22 and three, respectively, while she added seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>As UCSB’s primary option in its frontcourt, Edelman held her ground in the team’s first meeting with 15 points on 7-of-9 shooting, eight rebounds, and two steals.</p>\n<p>Signs of the Gauchos deciding to get Edelman more involved is important as her ability to draw the defense into the paint can be beneficial in freeing up the perimeter, especially as Santa Barbara has struggled from long range as of recently.</p>\n<p>Since recording a program-high 15 made three-pointers against UC Irvine on Jan. 28, UCSB has been unable to shake its inefficient shooting from beyond the arc. In four-straight games, it has recorded a three-point percentage of 30 percent or lower.</p>\n<p>While the three-point shot has gradually diminished, also complementing Edelman’s play in the paint has been redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. Whether if she uses her dazzling speed to drive to the hoop or dish out the ball, Toler has been UCSB’s most consistent player for nearly the past month.</p>\n<p>In seven of the team’s last eight games, the Gauchos’ top bench player has scored at least 12 points and is the team’s leading scorer through conference play at 11.4 points per game. Her vision to get the ball into passing lanes and shooter on the perimeter is evident as well as she is third in the Big West in assists per game, averaging 4.2.</p>\n<p>Prepared to face the Highlanders, who are second in the Big West in both team field goal percentage and assists per game at 41 percent and 16.5 dimes per game. Their assists per contest average ranks 32<sup>nd in</sup> the nation.</p>\n<p>Leading the Highlanders is senior forward Réjane Vérin. Despite playing down in the paint, Vérin is an all-around playmaker as she averages 4.1 assists per game, tied for third best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Coming off back-to-back 20-point games, UCR’s leader enters this week’s slate of games as the Big West’s No. 1 scorer at 17.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Both Edelman and Vérin had 15 points each when the two teams faced each other earlier this season. Edelman ended that game 4-of-4 from the field, but the perfect shooting performance would not be enough in 37 minutes of play. The anticipated battle between the two will be something to keep an eye on as they hope to maintain momentum.</p>\n<p>Following their trip to Riverside, the Gauchos are also seeking to sweep Long Beach State Saturday night.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be hoping to replicate its stout defense from its first game against LBSU in which it held the 49ers to a 23.8 three-point percentage on 5-of-21 shooting from beyond arc.</p>\n<p>This will be a difficult task as Long Beach State is coming off tying its single-game program record of 20 made three-pointers in its blowout win over Cal State Fullerton last weekend. The 49ers set a program and conference record with their 45 three-point attempts.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State is tied for both 22<sup>nd</sup> in three-point field goals made and 25<sup>th</sup> in three-point field goals per game in the nation at 203 and an 8.1 average, respectively.</p>\n<p>Most notably, LBSU forced 23 turnovers to gain a 29-7 advantage in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>Hoping to contain a 49er team looking for its third-straight win, UCSB not only must ensure that it properly defends the perimeter, but also must capitalize from long range as points in the paint alone may not be enough to defeat LBSU.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and UC Riverside is Thursday, Feb. 16 at 5 p.m. The Gauchos will play Long Beach State Saturday, Feb. 18 at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsbs-road-voyage-continues-face-ucr-and-lbsu/","id":488,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[487,486,485],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Tied For Third After Earning Season Sweep of Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-11.50.32-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-11.50.32-AM.png?resize=978%2C608&ssl=1","description":"Back on the winning track to end a two-game losing streak, the UCSB women's basketball team had a great shooting performance in its road win at Hawaii.

Santa Barbara is currently tied with UC Riverside for third place in the league standings. Hawaii lost its fourth-straight game, and is now 8-15 and 4-7 in conference play for seventh place.</p>\n<p>In what was just her second career 20-point game, Edelman got off to a quick start, scoring four of the Gauchos’ six points to begin the game.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 30 percent or below – 28.6 percent on a 4-of-14 finish – form behind the three-point line for the fourth consecutive game, redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter began the first period hot from long range.</p>\n<p>Porter went a perfect 3-of-3 shooting in the first quarter. Her three makes from beyond the arc were her only field goals for the night as she ended the game with nine points on 3-of-10 overall, 3-of-7 three-point shooting. Her three-point make with 29 second remaining in the period gave UCSB a 20-12 lead.</p>\n<p>Both junior guard Sarah Toeaina and freshman forward Keleah-Aiko Koloi managed to keep Hawaii within close distance of UCSB’s lead with four points apiece.</p>\n<p>Just like Hawaii’s first meeting against the Gauchos, Toeaina led the Rainbow Wahine in scoring again with 19 points on a 8-of-15 performance from the field. Koloi concluded the game without a miss, going 3-of-3 shooting and for six points in eight minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos first double-figure lead of 22-12 occurred as a result of a made layup by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe in the first minute of the second quarter. Jemerigbe had a competent night with 10 points on 4-of-9 shooting along with three steals.</p>\n<p>Two quick three-point makes by freshman guard Julissa Tago and sophomore forward Leah Salanoa cut the Gauchos’ lead to 25-18.</p>\n<p>Each time Hawaii managed to score a basket, UCSB responded with points of its own to maintain a lead. Most notably, UCSB held the Rainbow Wahine to just nine points in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Following a 30 second timeout, the Gauchos completely controlled the final five minutes of the period to enter halftime on a 9-1 run. Beginning with a made jumpshot by Jemerigbe, at the core of Santa Barbara’s run was junior forward Chaya Durr with four points. Durr ended the game with six points, five rebounds, and one steal as she helped UCSB enter halftime with a 36-21 lead.</p>\n<p>In spite of the large deficit, Hawaii was a different team coming into the second half. The Rainbow Wahine replied to the Gauchos’ closing run with a 12-3 run in the opening minutes of the third, forcing UCSB to call a timeout as its lead was trimmed to 39-31.</p>\n<p>As Hawaii outscored UCSB 18-13 in the period, leading the team’s comeback was Toeaina, scoring 10 of her 19 points. Her efficient shot selection of driving to the basket for layups in addition to her mid-range shooting allowed Hawaii to come within its closest deficit of the game at 41-37.</p>\n<p>But, the Rainbow Wahine defense could not stop the steady shooting of UCSB, who earned a 10-point lead 49-39 to end the quarter after a made three-pointer by freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Unable to disrupt UCSB’s rhythmic shooting night, Hawaii never overcame its double-figure deficit.</p>\n<p>Guiding the Gauchos to their fourth road win of the season was the fourth quarter play of both Edelman and redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>The two combined for 14 points in the last 10 minutes of regulation. After a quiet first three quarters, scoring just four points, Toler’s 3-of-3 shooting in the fourth was essential to UCSB closing the game.</p>\n<p>Playing all 10 minutes of the period, the elusive guard was responsible for all eight of the Gauchos’ points in the final 2 and a half minutes of the game. She was effective in both penetrating and finishing at the rim as well as at the free-throw line where she went 4-of-6 on the night.</p>\n<p>Toler led all bench players in scoring with 12 points as she went 4-of-6 from the field, helping UCSB lock up its victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its road leg of games, resuming play this Thursday, Feb. 16 at UC Riverside at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75680\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75680\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/","id":471,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[470,469,468],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outhustled by CSUN in 62-55 Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-09-at-1.01.22-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-09-at-1.01.22-PM.png?resize=980%2C608&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team lost its second consecutive home game Thursday night after being defeated by Cal State Northridge.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There was no benefit to its homecourt advantage once again as the UCSB women’s basketball team was defeated by Cal State Northridge 62-55 Wednesday night at the Thunderdome. The Matadors have now won the season series over UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was simply outhustled. Outrebounded 53-36, UCSB had no answer for the Matadors’ sophomore center Channon Fluker, who notched 17 points and tied her career-high of 20 rebounds. Fluker’s 14 defensive rebounds are the second most in a single-game in CSUN’s Division I history.</p>\n<p>“The discipline for us right now, and the fight for us has just been gut wrenching for all of us,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “If we can’t knock down the three, which we hven’t for three games, somebody’s got to put it on the floor and get to the rim, and get fouled. We missed 18 layups. We got too many [girls] that just played the three-point line.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

It’s the fourth time in five games that the Gauchos have shot below 30 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Now on a two-game losing streak, the Gauchos fall to fourth in the Big West standings at 11-12, 6-4. Just one conference win away from tying UCSB, CSUN won its fourth-straight to improve to 12-11 and 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was an undisciplined start for UCSB’s offense in the opening minutes of Thursday’s game as the Gauchos had three turnovers in their first five possessions.</p>\n<p>While UCSB dealt with miscues, CSUN gradually established a rhythm that led to its 7-0 run and lead.</p>\n<p>Beginning with sophomore center Channon Fluker and ending with a three-point make by junior guard Serafina Maulpe, the Matadors seemed to be on their way to repeating their 48 percent shooting percentage in the first meeting.</p>\n<p>Maulupe finished with a game-high 22 points, 17 of which she scored in the first half.</p>\n<p>Yet, halting CSUN’s run was the subbing in of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler at the 6:32 mark as she served as the catalyst to the Gauchos’ 8-0 run. She scored a team-high 12 points, a game-high six assists, and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>The string of points began with Toler grabbing a defensive rebound, then driving coast-to-coast for the foul and score before converting at the free-throw line to score the team’s first field goal of the game. A made layup freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez gave UCSB its first lead of the game of 12-11.</p>\n<p>The Matadors regained their lead of 12-11 as a result of a made free-throw by Maulupe. With the shot clock off, CSUN ended the first period with a 14-11 lead after a spin and layup by freshman guard Hayley Tanabe.</p>\n<p>UCSB found itself on the downside of a run once again in the opening minutes of the second quarter as CSUN put together a 9-2 run, in which Maulupe scored seven points during the stretch. Scoring points both in the lane and from behind the perimeter, CSUN’s all-around scorer handed the Matadors their first double –figure lead of the game of 23-13.</p>\n<p>Despite inconsistencies from beyond the arc, UCSB had some peak moments along the perimeter. Knocking down some major deep shots were both Redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter and freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez with back-to-back three-pointers to decrease the team’s lead to four 23-19.</p>\n<p>Porter recorded 10 points on 4-of-10 shooting, 2-of-7 from long range. Hernandez nearly posted a similar outcome with eight points while finishing 3-of-9 and 2-of-7 from three-point land.</p>\n<p>Providing hustle off the bench was junior forward Taylor Farris, scoring UCSB’s final two field goals of the half with a baseline floater and jumper. In 16 minutes of play, Farris had six points and three rebounds on 3-of-8 shooting.</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos inched closer and closer to trimming their deficit, CSUN would respond each time.</p>\n<p>Quietly emerging for CSUN with a perfect 4-of-4, 2-of-2 three-point shooting performance was senior guard Emily Cole. It was her two made three-pointers in the final three minutes of the first half that curtailed UCSB’s momentum, as one of her deep range makes allowed the Matadors to enter halftime with a 33-25 lead.</p>\n<p>The exchange of baskets between both teams continued in the third quarter as CSUN maintained a lead of at least seven points for the entire period.</p>\n<p>After coming up empty-handed in its first two possessions of the second half, a drive and drawing of a foul by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe gave the Gauchos life despite her being unable to convert at the free-throw line as UCSB would trail 33-27. Jemerigbe tallied six points and three assists.</p>\n<p>Maulupe and Cole were the Matadors’ source of offense in the third, combining for nine points on 4-of-7 shooting.</p>\n<p>Entering down nine points 46-37, the fourth quarter turned out to be the Gauchos most productive quarter as they honed in scoring the ball to amass a 10-3 run during the period.</p>\n<p>Their defense played a critical role in the stretch of points as they held CSUN to just one point in the first three and half minutes of the final period.</p>\n<p>The peak of UCSB’s run began with a three-point make by sophomore guard Coco Miller, who brought the Gauchos closer to Northridge’s lead 49-44. Miller concluded Thursday with seven points as her only two field goals in the game were from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Following Miller’s make was the Gauchos’ press defense which forced CSUN into a 30-second shot clock violation with 5:18 remaining in the game. Porter would then hit a three-pointer to bring UCSB within a two-point deficit of 49-47.</p>\n<p>Yet, overshadowing UCSB’s comeback effort was Fluker’s outburst of 13 fourth quarter points.

The Matadors are 11-11 and 4-4, making them fifth in the conference.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s trio of consecutive wins began with its 75-61 victory over UCSB in the two teams’ first meeting on Jan. 25.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to avoid a season sweep against CSUN, which last happened in the 2014-15 season. In order to do so, the Gauchos will look to overcome their worst shooting performance in a conference game this season in their loss to UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara shot 31 percent from the field on 18-for-58 shooting and finished with a 12.5 three-point percentage on 2-for-16 perimeter shooting.</p>\n<p>In three of its last four games, excluding its program-record of 15 made three-pointers, UCSB has experienced a decline from beyond the arc. During the span of games, Santa Barbara has shot 30 percent or below from behind the three-point line on 13-for-56 shooting.</p>\n<p>“We went back a couple games with the guards, [and] looked at all of our makes and attempts,” Henrickson said. “[We] just looked at footwork. The message wasn’t to discourage them from shooting, but to encourage footwork, to be shot ready.”</p>\n<p>Hoping to regain consistency in perimeter shooting is redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter. She finished with zero points on 0-for-8 overall, 0-for-5 three-point shooting in the team’s recent loss.</p>\n<p>Yet, her scoreless performance isn’t too discouraging, as Porter has displayed her sharpshooting from long range all season, and currently ranks both third and fourth in total three-pointers made and three-point percentage in the Big West at 48 and 40.3 percent, respectively. She remains one of the team’s top scorers, emerging during conference play for an 11.4 points-per-game average.</p>\n<p>Despite her scoreless performance, it can be expected that Porter will look to establish her shooter’s touch early, and she could be the team’s difference maker after sitting out the Gauchos’ first matchup against the Matadors due to a shoulder injury.</p>\n<p>“We ended up playing four guards [in the first meeting]. Obviously, we missed her that day because she does a lot of really good things for her,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “She’s gotta pressure the ball on the perimeter, be aggressive offensively, get some offensive rebounds, get to the free-throw line and be a big athletic guard in this league. She’s a big part of who we are, but there are no excuses. We’re a team sport, somebody else has the opportunity to step up, but we didn’t really have anybody take advantage of the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>While Porter provides an “athletic big” presence, the speed and downhill play of both of UCSB’s point guards in senior Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior Drea Toler is the focal point to the team’s operation.</p>\n<p>Currently averaging a career-high of nine points per game, Jemerigbe’s most significant improvement has been her shooting. Specifically, she has thrived from behind the three-point line as she leads the Big West in three-point percentage with a 47.1 average.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Toler has been UCSB’s sparkplug off the bench and has been most impactful during Big West play. After averaging 9.2 ppg during the non-conference schedule, Toler is now just behind Porter for the team lead in conference games with 11.2 ppg.</p>\n<p>While UCSB has managed to outdo opponents with its scoring and three-point shooting, UCSB’s ability to improve its on-ball defense will be most important tonight as it prepares to face a Matador team that can produce both inside the paint and along the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Presenting a problem for the Gauchos’ defense in the first meeting was the shooting of redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe. She scored a career-high 28 points and finished the game 10-for-21 from the field, 3-for-8 from downtown. Finishing eighth in the Big West with a 34.6 three-point percentage last season, Maulupe is on pace once again for a top-10 spot with a current 37.9 long range percentage that ranks sixth.</p>\n<p>Aiding Maulupe off the bench was sophomore guard Cheyenne Allen with a career-high 21 points.</p>\n<p>Yet, the biggest concern for the Gauchos is finding a way to contain CSUN’s primary force of sophomore center Channon Fluker.</p>\n<p>She became just the second player ever in CSUN’s Division I history to record a 20-20 game with 22 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in the team’s win over Long Beach State over the weekend.</p>\n<p>As the only current Big West player to average a double-double — 15.8 ppg and a league-leading 11.4 rebounds per game, respectively — Fluker’s talents have placed her alongside some of the nation’s best frontcourt players.</p>\n<p>The Matadors’ post star is sixth in rebounds per game, tied for seventh in double-doubles with 14, eighth in total rebounds with 251, 24th in both total blocks and blocks per game with 54 and a 2.45 average, respectively.</p>\n<p>“[Fluker] is everybody’s primary concern defensively, but where they got us [in the first meeting] was inside-outside. They scored on the perimeter and didn’t have to go to her right away. They had great pace offensively, really stretched the defense,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>Fluker recorded a career-high seven blocks in Northridge’s victory over UCSB earlier this season. She also tallied 11 rebounds, which contributed to the Matadors outrebounding the Gauchos 47-27.</p>\n<p>Pivotal to UCSB’s attempt to contain the Matadors will be its ability to take away one of the Matadors’ assets and not allow them to control both the interior and perimeter.</p>\n<p>UCSB and CSUN tips off tonight at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75585\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75585\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/","id":455,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[454,453,452],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Big West Best UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=800%2C419&ssl=1","description":"With its four-game home winning streak on the line, the UCSB women's basketball team will look to hand the Big West's top team a loss before heading on the road.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Visiting the Thunderdome on a three-game winning streak, UC Davis sits atop the Big West with the league’s best overall and conference record of 16-6, 7-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB is coming off its best defensive performance of the season, in which it held Cal State Fullerton to a season-low 37 points. Most notably, the Gauchos’ bench was pivotal in their 20-point victory, outscoring the Titans 30-2 in bench points.</p>\n<p>Responsible for a tied game-high 14 of those bench points was redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>Over the span of the Gauchos’ last five games, Toler has undoubtedly been the team’s flare off the bench on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court, especially during the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>During Big West play, Toler is second on the team in scoring with an 11.5 points per game average. She has tallied double-figures in five consecutive games and is shooting 54 percent over the span of games.</p>\n<p>Her ability to penetrate the paint and find open shooters continues to be beneficial as well as she is tied with her backcourt partner senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe for third in the Big West with a 4.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Often undersized when guarding in the backcourt, it is Toler’s quick hands and feet that have allowed her to be one of the team’s best on-ball defenders.</p>\n<p>Toler’s 1.9 steals per game average during conference play ranks second in the Big West. In 17 of UCSB’s 21 games this season, Toler has had at least one steal. As of recently, she has been a consistent bother on defense with three steals in three of the team’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Also providing consistency within the Gauchos’ starting lineup are both redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Alongside Toler, Edelman and Porter are the team’s other two double figure scorers during conference play. Porter averages a team leading 13 PPG, while Edelman is at 10.8, respectively. Edelman leads the Big West in field goal percentage at 57.4 percent.</p>\n<p>While UCSB will definitely need an improved first half start, opposite of its 17 points scored in its previous game, its on-ball pressure both inside the paint and along the perimeter will be most important in facing UC Davis.</p>\n<p>UC Davis plays at a patient, yet efficient pace which is most evident by their offense. Most importantly, the Aggies are structured with each possession as they are second in the conference with the least amount of turnovers per game at a 14.0 average.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, their care with the ball translates to their scoring as they lead the Big West with 70.6 PPG. The focal point to UC Davis’ offensive success is redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch.</p>\n<p>An All-Big West Second team and Big West All-Freshman team selection last season after being the program’s first freshman to lead the team in scoring since 1979-80 at 13.9 PPG, Bertsch is one of the league’s most productive frontcourt players.</p>\n<p>She ranks second in PPG and fourth in field goal percentage in the Big West with averages of 16.1 and 51.5, respectively. Bertsch owns a team-leading six 20-point games this season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ frontcourt star is a key factor in their conference leading 44.1 field goal percentage. Yet, also contributing is their 35.8 three-point percentage which also leads the Big West as well.</p>\n<p>Providing UC Davis with a perimeter threat is junior forward Pele Gianotti. She averages 10.3 PPG and is one of the Aggies’ most lethal shooters, making 37.6 percent of her three-pointers, ranking eighth in the conference.</p>\n<p>Despite Davis’ explosive offense, UCSB has the ability to keep up with the pace of the Aggies as the Gauchos are right behind them in both field goal percentage and three-point percentage at 41.3 and 35.1, respectively.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tip-off this Saturday, Feb. 4 at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75462\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75462\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/","id":447,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[446,445,444],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Routs UC Irvine On the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=800%2C419&ssl=1","description":"After having its four-game winning streak ended in its previous, the UCSB women's basketball team got back on the winning track with a blowout win over UC Irvine on Saturday.

All but one of the Gauchos’ eight field goals were made from downtown as they made seven-straight to close the period.</p>\n<p>Both Hernandez and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter, who returned from injury after sitting out the game at CSUN, were spot-on from long range. Each scored nine points in the opening period to power UCSB’s 23-7 run. Limited to 11 minutes, Porter was proactive with her time on the court as she ended with 15 points on 5-8 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine, who was without two starters due to injury and had just three players coming off its bench, couldn’t find its rhythm on the offensive end. The Anteaters ended the first period with more made free-throws at 4-4 than field goals at 3-for-10.</p>\n<p>Scoring one of UCI’s field goals and half of their free-throws was senior forward Shereen Sutherland. She had a team-high 20 points on 5-for-11 shooting and a career-high 10-of-11 free-throw performance. Still, the Anteaters trailed 23-11 at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s dominance continued in the following quarter with a 9-2 scoring run. Hernandez added two more three-pointers before halftime.</p>\n<p>Senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe silently had an efficient performance of 12 points on 4-for-6 and 2-for-2 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>Also making an impact was the emergence of UCSB’s bench. Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler and sophomore guard Makala Roper each were effective as Toler was fearless in her drive for layups and Roper followed suit along with displaying her midcourt range.</p>\n<p>A made layup by Roper gave the Gauchos a 43-19 advantage with 1:37 remaining before the half. She ended the game with nine points, while Toler had 12 points and a team-high three steals. Hernandez scored UCSB’s last basket of the quarter with a three-pointer.</p>\n<p>Although UCI’S senior forward Brittany Glassow responded with a three-point make of her own, it did not have much of an impact on the Anteaters’ deficit as they trailed 46-24 at halftime.</p>\n<p>Glassow led Irvine’s small bench rotation with six points on 2-for-3, 1-for-1 three-point shooting and tied for the team-high of six rebounds in 29 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Similar to how they both started the game, both Hernandez and Porter sustained their hot shooting hands in the second half. Pouring on makes from three-point land, both backcourt players went 2-for-3 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Porter was responsible for six points during the Gauchos’ 8-0 run in which they tallied their largest lead of 30 points at 60-30.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine’s spark came from Sutherland with nine points and senior guard Irene Chavez with five points but would not be enough to prevent the Gauchos from entering the fourth quarter 73-44 lead.</p>\n<p>A 5-0 run to open the fourth quarter showed the Anteaters’ unwillingness to accept defeat, but they couldn’t contain the Gauchos from closing out the game behind the play of Toler.</p>\n<p>Toler scored three-straight layups, scoring the majority of the team’s five field goals in the quarter. Despite its ability to make 18-of-23 free-throws, UCI’s poor shooting of 38.8 percent and 4-for-16 three-point shooting curtailed any chance of it making a comeback as UCSB earned the victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to the Thunderdome to face Cal State Fullerton this Wednesday, Feb. 1. at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75304\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75304\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/","id":452,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[451,450,449],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Streak Ends, Faces UC Irvine Next","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-26-at-12.49.49-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-26-at-12.49.49-PM.png?resize=795%2C402&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team was unable to preserve its four-game winning streak, losing in its first game back on the road at Cal State Northridge.

Porter currently leads the Gauchos in scoring during conference play with 13.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were also unable to contain the Matadors’ rhythmic shooting night. CSUN benefited from its backcourt players in both its starting lineup and bench rotation.</p>\n<p>After scoring a career-high 25 points last Saturday versus Cal Poly, redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe surpassed her career-best total with 28 points in the Matadors’ win over the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Combining with Maulupe for 49 of CSUN’s conference game best 75 points was sophomore guard Cheyenne Allen with a career-high 21 points on 6-for-9 shooting from the field and an 8-for-9 finish at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Overall, CSUN shot 48.2 percent from the field and 40 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>In addition to Maulupe and Allen, helping create the Matadors’ hot shooting was their rebounding.</p>\n<p>They outrebounded UCSB 47-27 as freshman forward Eliza Matthews had a game-high 12 rebounds and sophomore center Channon Fluker had 11.</p>\n<p>UCSB will wrap up its pair of away games for the week against UC Irvine this Saturday. Prior to facing Santa Barbara, the Anteaters will play Hawaii tonight at 9 p.m. PST. They will enter the Stan Sheriff Center at 3-16 and 1-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Various pieces have contributed to the Gauchos’ upgrade in play since the start of Big West play. A central piece has been the productivity of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman.</p>\n<p>In just her first season as a Gaucho, she has already solidified her role in the paint.<br>\nQuick enough to use her pivot foot and strong enough to post up and drive on a defender,</p>\n<p>Edelman has been nearly unstoppable as she holds the Big West lead in field goal percentage at 56 percent.</p>\n<p>Prior to scoring her lowest point total in a conference game with three on Wednesday, Edelman had posted double figures in four straight games.</p>\n<p>Despite grabbing a team-high 10 rebounds, Edelman’s offensive production was missed, as UCSB is 8-3 when she manages to score in double figures.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine’s women’s basketball program is in rebuilding condition after its decline in recent years.</p>\n<p>En route to its third-straight losing season, the Anteaters have not had a winning season since their 2013-14 run. In the past two seasons, UCI had a combined 12-51 record.</p>\n<p>The downward spiral led to the hiring of first-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue during the offseason last April.</p>\n<p>Despite losing just one senior from last season, UC Irvine has a multitude of players that lack in-game experience. All five of the team’s current seniors had never started a full season entering this year.</p>\n<p>In addition to the hiring of a new coach, the Anteaters are still dealing with the lingering effects of the early departure of their most impactful player last season in former forward Mokun Fajemisin.</p>\n<p>On a team that had no double-figure scorer, Fajemisin managed to lead UCI in scoring with<br>\n9.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Yet it was her defensive and rebounding abilities that were most pivotal. She led the Big West in blocks per game with a 2.0 average and ranked fifth in the Big West with 7.9 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>She was the conference’s ultimate rim protector as she ended last season with a conference-leading 54 blocks.</p>\n<p>Despite boasting an arsenal of three double-figure scorers — senior forward Shereen Sutherland, sophomore guard Andee Ritter and junior forward Sabrina Engelstad — UCI has had ongoing issues with both scoring and defending the ball.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are the Big West’s worst scoring defense, as they allow 72.2 points per game and are second-worst on offense with an average of 58.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB remains one of the conference’s top teams in terms of scoring the ball and playing three-point defense, ranking second by allowing just 63.7 points per game and third as it holds opponents to an average 29.2 percentage thus far.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Anteaters will tip-off this Saturday, Jan. 28, at 2 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 26, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<div id=\":yu\" class=\"ajR\" tabindex=\"0\" data-tooltip=\"Show trimmed content\"><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/","id":453,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[452,451,450],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Carries Momentum On The Road At CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-19-17_2-web-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-19-17_2-web-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will attempt to extend its four-game winning streak on the road at CSUN.

Sitting at 8-11 and 1-4 in conference play, the Matadors’ matchup versus UCSB will be the second of their four game home stand.</p>\n<p>There is a current total of three Gauchos that average 10 points per game. One of them is redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman, who serves as the team’s focal point in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>Leading the Big West in field goal percentage with a 57.6 overall average, and has been even more efficient during UCSB’s conference schedule, making a huge improvement to 65.1 percent. Helping create high percentage shots has been her ability to rebound the ball as well. During conference play, she is tied for third in rebounds per game at 8.4.</p>\n<p>Edelman has increased her endurance to be able to produce when called upon, ranking second in minutes per game with a 37.4 average during the conference slate.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s post player is coming off her highest point total in a conference game thus far of 19 points. Over the course of both the non-conference and conference schedules combined, Edelman leads the team in games with at least 10 points at 11.</p>\n<p>It can be expected that Edelman will face one of her toughest matchups in the paint this Wednesday as she will battle it out with sophomore center Channon Fluker.</p>\n<p>After an exceptional freshman season, in which she was named the Big West Freshman of the Year and became the first rookie to be a First Team All-Big West selection since 2002, Fluker remains within the top ranks of post players in the conference.</p>\n<p>Averaging 15.2 points and 10 rebounds per game, Fluker is currently the only player in the Big West to average a double-double in any statistical category. Her rebounds per game average ranks 31<sup>st</sup> in the nation. Her 206 total rebounds is the most in league play so far this season and has helped the Matadors gain their conference leading average of 42.6 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>She is a proven rim protector, owning a conference leading 2.2 blocks per game average. Her current total of 42 blocks, which leads all Big West players, has already surpassed her total of 35 in her first year.</p>\n<p>Although CSUN was swept in both of its games against the Gauchos last season, Fluker made her presence felt in game two of the series with a 31-point performance.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that the Matadors’ gameplan revolves around Fluker, so the Gauchos will look to contain her presence in the interior, but still must remain aware of the three-point shooting of redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe. Maulupe’s 40.5 three-point percentage ranks sixth in the Big West, while 47 three-point makes is second.</p>\n<p>Thus far, UCSB has been consistent with its perimeter defense, ranking third overall in three-point defense at 28.7 percent. They also are second in scoring defense, allowing 63.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal State Northridge will face each this Wednesday, Jan. 25 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75192\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75192\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/","id":282,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[281,280,279],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Fourth Straight, Tied For First In Conf.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/womensbball-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/womensbball-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team earned its fourth consecutive win in its 74-62 defeat of Hawaii Saturday night.

The six rebounds were a season-high for Jemerigbe to go along with 11 points and six assists. Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler posted career-high totals with 17 points and two three-point makes.</p>\n<p>It was all UCSB to open the first quarter as the Gauchos shot 69.2 percent from the field and 4-for-5 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>The inside-outside game of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter was in full effect. Porter continued her hot shooting from the last two games, starting 3-for-3 from behind the perimeter. She would end the game 3-for-4 from the field and play just 10 minutes after enduring an apparent shoulder injury.</p>\n<p>Playing a major role in the Gauchos’ commanding start was their defense as Hawaii ended the period with five turnovers, in which UCSB capitalized off of with 11 points.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing by double-figures 23-9, it was the shooting of junior guard Sarah Toeaina that kept Hawaii within range of reducing its deficit all game. She went 3-for-6 in the first period, signaling the start of her finishing with a game-high 22 points on a 10-for-19 shooting afternoon.</p>\n<p>Through the first three minutes of the second period, no basket was made by either team until the 6:41 mark for UCSB on a jumpshot by Toler to give UCSB a 25-15 lead.</p>\n<p>She was the Gauchos’ most active player in the period, scoring another basket as a result of a quick stop and go move to surpass the defender for a go-ahead layup and later earned a chase down block before eventually being subbed out.</p>\n<p>Toeaina remained the Rainbow Wahine’s primary source of offense with a jumpshot to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 27-21.</p>\n<p>With under two minutes remaining in the period, the Gauchos got back to feeding Edelman down low as she scored layups in the team’s last two possessions.</p>\n<p>A crucial three-pointer by sophomore forward Lahnia Salanoa brought Hawaii to its lowest first half deficit of five points, 31-26, to go into halftime.</p>\n<p>Jumpstarting Hawaii’s offense to its 7-2 run to open the second half was freshman guard Julissa Tago with a three-pointer and midrange jumpshot along the baseline. Tying the game at 33 apiece was Toeaina’s layup with 8:06 left in the third.</p>\n<p>Despite her reduced role this season, junior guard Makala Roper provided a quick surge off the bench with a three-pointer to end the tie and put UCSB up 36-33.</p>\n<p>From that point on, UCSB maintained a lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Roper’s shot ignited the Gauchos’ 12-4 run that led to Hawaii calling a 20 second timeout.</p>\n<p>Providing a scoring outburst during the run was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez which included back-to-back three-pointers, increasing UCSB’s lead to 45-37, she scored all eight of her points in the quarter while shooting 3-for-5 and 2-for-4 from deep.</p>\n<p>Hawaii took advantage of UCSB’s scoreless play in the final 3:54 of the third as Toeaina would score two consecutive layups to help the Rainbow Wahine enter the game’s final period down 50-45.</p>\n<p>In the fourth quarter, UCSB looked like the team it was to open the game as its grittiness was on full display as it embarked on an 8-0 run. Its offense was most efficient in the period, shooting 72.7 percent and 50 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>An offensive charge led to the Gauchos’ first possession. Scoring five of the eight was Edelman, putting her pivot foot to work and posting up for a turnaround AND-1 layup in which she converted at the foul line.</p>\n<p>Scoring the other three in the team’s next possession was Jemerigbe’s drive and circus layup that fell as she drew a foul that led to her making a free-throw to increase Santa Barbara’s lead to 58-45.</p>\n<p>A three-point make by Toler extended UCSB’s run to 11-3, but responding with a three of her own was senior guard Briana Harris to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to 61-51.</p>\n<p>But the three-point shot wouldn’t be Toler’s last as she scored 10 points straight to give UCSB a 68-57 advantage.</p>\n<p>A quick jumpshot by Toeaina trimmed Santa Barbara’s lead to 66-57, but the Rainbow Wahine were unable to draw any closer as time continued to expire.</p>\n<p>With a 10-point lead of 68-58, helping secure the Gauchos’ 74-62 win was the veteran leadership of Jemerigbe. With the ball at the top of the key as time went by, Jemerigbe drove the right lane for a layup, came up with a steal in the game’s lasting seconds, and was clutch with a 4-for-7 finish at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>With its three-game home stand now over, UCSB will be on the road at Cal State Northridge on Wednesday, Jan. 25. The game will begin at  7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/","id":408,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[407,406,405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set for Final Game of Home Stand, Host Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team is set for the finale of its three-game home stand as it will face Hawaii in the Thunderdome in search of its fourth consecutive win.

During UCSB’s winning streak, she has made at least three shots from behind the perimeter in three-straight games, and is averaging a three-point percentage of 45 percent.</p>\n<p>She is currently tied with fellow Gaucho sophomore guard Coco Miller for third in the Big West in both three-point makes per game and total threes made at a 2.2 average and 38 apiece, respectively.</p>\n<p>Providing a lift on both offense and defense when coming off the bench continues to be redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>In the team’s previous game she tied her career-high of 14 points. Possessing the ability to penetrate and drive to the basket or kick the ball out to shooters, Toler leads the Big West in assists per 40 minutes with a 7.7 average and is tied for third with a 4.3 average per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the aftermath of five seniors departing continues to affect Hawaii as its young core of seven freshman and five sophomores continues to learn their roles on the court.</p>\n<p>A graduating class that included impact players such as leading scorer Destiny King and its leading three-point shooter for three-straight seasons in Ashleigh Karaitiana, Hawaii has struggled thus far this season.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine rank last in the Big West in scoring, averaging 58.1 points per game and are second to last at eighth in three-point shooting percentage at 28.1.</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s subpar averages, leading the Rainbow Wahine in a majority of their games has been the team’s only upperclassmen and backcourt duo senior point guard Briana Harris and junior guard Sarah Toeaina.</p>\n<p>Toeaina serves as Hawaii’s leading scorer at 12.3 points per game, while Harris is the runner up at 10.8 per contest. In the team’s win over Cal Poly Thursday night, the two guards combined for 47 points to bolster the Rainbow Wahine’s season-high field goal finish of 57 percent.</p>\n<p>Pacing Hawaii’s great shooting night was Harris, who matched her career-high of 24 points and Toeaina, who finished with 23 points and a career-high six assists.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii has struggled shooting from beyond the arc, it has been exceptional in defending the long range shot as it leads the Big West in three-point defense with a 26.3 average, ranking just ahead of UCSB at second with a 28.3 average.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos have allowed the least amount of total three-point makes in the conference at 68-of-240 in comparison to Hawaii’s second-place standing of 92-of-350.</p>\n<p>With both teams presenting stout defense along the perimeter, it could be expected that both programs attempt to score most of their points in the paint in hopes of sucking in the defense to create opportunities along the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Hawaii will tip-off today at 4 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75047\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75047\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/","id":392,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[391,390,389],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Third-Straight, Stun LBSU At Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_1-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winning its third consecutive game, the UCSB women's basketball team improved to 8-9 and 3-1 in the Big West to tie for second in the conference standings after defeating LBSU Thursday night.

It was also the first time this season that two Gauchos tallied double-doubles. Redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman concluded Thursday’s game with 10 points and 10 rebounds for her fourth career double-double.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler tied her career-high of 14 points on 6-for-12 shooting and a game-high six assists. Meanwhile senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe ended with 10 points and five assists.</p>\n<p>Much credit is due to the UCSB defense as its pressure led to a 5-for-21 three-point shooting performance by Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Following a quick two-for-two start to the game on layups by Edelman, UCSB went cold from the field, missing three consecutive three-point attempts and trailed 9-5.</p>\n<p>Helping Long Beach State embark on its quick start was the three-point shooting of junior guard Cece Wilson, who hit back-to-back long range shots. Wilson had 10 points on 4-for-7 shooting.</p>\n<p>Knocking down UCSB’s first long range basket at the 5:40 mark of the first quarter was Porter, which sparked the Gauchos 13-5 run to close out the first quarter as they shot 50 percent from both the field and behind the perimeter on 7-for-14 and 3-6 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>Porter set the tone for the Gauchos by going on an 8-1 run of her own during the stretch of points. She ended the period three-for-three shooting and two-for-two from beyond the arc as UCSB ended the period with an 18-14 lead.</p>\n<p>Prior to that, UCSB took a 16-14 lead after a made three-pointer by Miller. It would maintain the lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ largest first half lead was of seven points with a 25-18 lead which resulted from a three-point make from sophomore guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>However, the 49ers did not allow the deficit to expand as they went on a 6-0 run to cut UCSB’s lead to 25-24. Leading Long Beach’s run was senior guard/forward Jewelyn Sawyer, scoring each point.</p>\n<p>Sawyer scored 10 of her game-high 20 points in the second quarter, making five-of-six shots in the period. She ended the game 9-for-10 from the field and grabbed seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB managed to enter the half with a 32-31 lead after a made jumpshot by Miller.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the game with 16 turnovers as it occasionally had its difficulties with the 49ers’ full court press throughout the game but was able to overcome them.</p>\n<p>UCSB remained consistent from behind the perimeter as two of its first three field goals were three-pointers by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and Porter to open the second half.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s success from three-point range in the third quarter, going 3-for-6 from deep and 6-for-14 overall, helped it to sustain a lead of 47-41 entering the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>The final period was the Beach’s best period as they scored a total of 19 points. Despite scoring one field goal in the third period, Sawyer made it a two-point deficit at 49-47 with a made layup.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest shots of the game was a three-point make by Jemerigbe which was UCSB’s first basket of the quarter, but was a crucial basket that provided a cushion as it extended the Gauchos’ lead to 52-47.</p>\n<p>Both teams would go on to trade scores as LBSU would get its last chance to either trim its deficit or tie with a three, but a missed three-point attempt senior forward Madison Montgomery.</p>\n<p>An 11-for-12 performance at the free-throw line in the fourth quarter helped seal the deal as Jemerigbe and Porter both were clutch, going 4-for-4 to secure the win.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play the final game of its home stand vs. Hawaii this Saturday, Jan. 21 at 4 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The hot shooting hand coming into tonight’s game is redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Porter is the Gauchos’ leading scorer since the start of Big West play at 14.0 points per game. She is coming off a career-high performance of 22 points, four three-pointers made, four steals and six free-throws made in the team’s 58-54 win over UC Riverside on Saturday.</p>\n<p>In addition to the victory, she earned her first ever Big West Athlete of the Week award.</p>\n<p>Porter has established herself as one of UCSB’s sharpshooters alongside sophomore guard Coco Miller as both are tied for the team lead in three-pointers made at 35 apiece, which ties them for the third most three-point makes in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Distributing the ball to these shooters has been the precise court vision of UCSB’s backcourt duo of point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe places in second and Toler in third in assists per game at 4.4 and 4.2, respectively; the two have combined for a total of 138 assists.<br>\n“We’ve talked a lot as a staff and with our players about improving our decsion making,” Henrickson explained. “Whether we should drive it, should we drive it baseline, or should we drive it middle? No great shooter ever stands still. Your job is to reward the player that’s driving and sucking up some defense to find a window and moving without the ball. We’re an unselfish group. We recognize it’s not your shot, it’s our shot.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were stellar on the defensive end as well, recording season-highs of 16 steals and 24 forced turnovers, respectively. Through three conference games, UCSB leads the Big West in forced turnovers per game at an average of 18.0.</p>\n<p>“For us to be disruptive, get our hands on[the ball], and increase the number of turnovers that we create [will be important],” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>However, Long Beach State presents a dual threat on both ends of the court, owning an overall conference best average of 21.1 forced turnovers per game, and they have been efficient when possessing the ball with just 14.7 turnovers per game for second best.</p>\n<p>Boasting a 39.7 three-point percentage, which ranks second best in the conference, the 49ers visit with tons of momentum shooting the ball after knocking down 14 three-pointers, second most in a single-game in program history, in their 83-80 victory over Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Beach concluded the game with a season-high 50.9 field goal percentage and was led by the outstanding play of senior point guard Anna Kim, who had 25 points on 7-for-10 and 4-5 three-point shooting, four rebounds, five assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>Despite not being one of the 49ers’ double-figure scorers, Kim has managed to be effective with her shot selection as she leads both the Big West and Long Beach State with a 50.0 three-point percentage, holds the team lead in field goal percentage at 46.5 and plays the most minutes per game with a 26.4 average.</p>\n<p>At the core of the 49ers’ offense, helping create space around the perimeter is senior forward Madison Montgomery.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s leading scorer at 11.3 PPG, Montgomery is most effective defending the ball in the paint.<br>\nShe ranks fifth in the Big West in both blocks per game and total blocks at 1.2 and 22, respectively.</p>\n<p>Montgomery can stretch the floor as well, tied for third on the team in three-pointers made at 15 with senior guard Raven Benton.</p>\n<p>Success from beyond the arc is pivotal for both teams in this matchup as the 49ers own a conference high in three-pointers made at 155.<br>\nMeanwhile, the Gauchos have defended the long distance shot superbly, allowing just 65 made three-pointers and ranking third in three-point defense at 28.8 percent.</p>\n<p>“You have to recognize personnel. If you cushion them, they have players that go ‘hand down, man down’ and will shoot it on you,” Henrickson said. “If you go under an on-ball screen, they’re going to shoot behind it. If you make a mistake and don’t know that you’re guarding a shooter and there’s penetration coming at you, you have to ball side deny and that help has got to come from the back side.”</p>\n<p>Going against a Long Beach State team that has the ability to get hot from long range, UCSB will have to remain committed to the importance of on-ball pressure in hopes of preventing any type of shooting rhythm for the 49ers’ offense.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s matchup between UCSB and Long Beach State will begin tonight at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 19, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74970\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74970\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/gauchos-hope-to-continue-momentum-host-lbsu/","id":300,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[299,298,297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nick DePuy Selected 19th Overall in MLS SuperDraft","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DePuy_FILEPHOTO_soccer-4-of-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DePuy_FILEPHOTO_soccer-4-of-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a stellar four-year career in his time with the UCSB men's soccer team, former Gaucho Nick DePuy was selected 19th overall in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft last Friday.

His remarkable total of 16 game-winning goals ranks second in the program record book and is third in conference season. Topping it all off is his feat of 226 shots which places fourth all-time in both UCSB and Big West history.</p>\n<p>Take a look inside the UCSB and Big West record books and DePuy’s imprint decorates a variety of statistics. He is the first player in Big West history to be a three-time Offensive Player of the Year, winning the award three times from 2014-2016.</p>\n<p>DePuy became the seventh player in UCSB history to receive the accolade and the latest to be given the honors since Garza in 2010.</p>\n<p>Along with taking the crown as the conference’s most dominant player for three consecutive seasons, the forward was a three-time All-Big West First Team selection over the same time span.</p>\n<p>Although he didn’t begin his collegiate career as the lethal scorer he would soon be known as, DePuy was a pivotal asset in the team’s progression since his arrival in 2013.</p>\n<p>He concluded his freshman campaign as one of four players on the team to start in all 21 of UCSB’s matches despite recording no goals that season. He was named to 2013 Big West All-Freshman Team and was also an All-Big West Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>Originally beginning his career as a midfielder and occasionally playing in the center back, DePuy’s journey to becoming one of the nation’s best players began with Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s decision to start the 6’5”, 200-plus pounder at the forward position.</p>\n<p>Prior to his first career start as striker in the Gauchos’ game against San Diego State on Sept. 26, 2014, DePuy had just one career goal. The transition proved worthwhile as the move to the top of the field helped UCSB clinch the Big West North title as it ended the year at 10-7-3 and 6-2-2.</p>\n<p>His sophomore season marked the buildup to his emergence as UCSB’s top player during the conference portion of the season to lead all players in goals at eight, game-winning goals at five, shots at 42 and points at 17.</p>\n<p>The transition to forward was most beneficial the following year as DePuy would go on to have one of the most unforgettable seasons in UCSB history.</p>\n<p>His Junior season served as a breakout year in which DePuy’s eight game-winning goals and 15 total regular season goals led the nation; he also became the fourth Gaucho ever to be named an NSCAA First Team All-American.</p>\n<p>After making the move to forward, DePuy led the nation in goals with 24 at the end of the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>As DePuy produced on the field, the nationwide exposure continued to grow, with DePuy ending the 2015 season as the fourth Gaucho ever to be nominated as a semifinalist for the MAC Hermann Trophy — an honor awarded to the top Division I college soccer player.</p>\n<p>Following a NSCAA Far West All-Region Third Team selection in 2014, the forward’s astounding junior season led to him being a NSCAA Far West All-Region First Team selection just one year later.</p>\n<p>Entering the final chapter of DePuy’s career, it was expected that the Gauchos’s opponents’ primary objective would be to contain the elite striker. While some teams did manage to reduce his role in scoring, he was never completely shut down against competition.</p>\n<p>In his final season, DePuy played a team-high 1,872 minutes, led the Big West in shots per game with an average of 3.15 and ranked sixth in the conference in goals with six. Expectations were high as he entered the 2016 season on the MAC Hermann Trophy watch list, was a CSN Preseason All-American and ended up being named to the NSCAA Far West All-Region Second Team.</p>\n<p>While the abundance of awards and milestones helped bring recognition to his great talent, DePuy was an even greater leader that remained humble and could be depended on as a team leader.</p>\n<p>His legacy is enhanced by his being a counterpart to the program’s achievement of four straight Big West North division titles and its first Sweet 16 appearance since 2011 in the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>Known for his skill and willingness to embrace the intensity of a game’s biggest moments while at UCSB, DePuy can only continue to ascend as he prepares for his MLS journey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 19, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74960\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/nick-depuy-selected-19th-overall-in-mls-superdraft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74960\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/nick-depuy-selected-19th-overall-in-mls-superdraft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/nick-depuy-selected-19th-overall-in-mls-superdraft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/nick-depuy-selected-19th-overall-in-mls-superdraft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/nick-depuy-selected-19th-overall-in-mls-superdraft/","id":1415,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1414,1413,1412],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":12,"route":"/authors/45"}},"__N_SSG":true}
