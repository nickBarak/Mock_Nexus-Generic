Let’s be real: There will never be another day when the Charlotte Bobcats rank atop the Eastern Conference standings or the Utah Jazz, in a reputably tough conference like the West. Even the few minutes that allow starting players to get their feet wet and shoot the Spalding is exciting to watch with the 2015 NBA season just three weeks away.</p>\n<p>Certainly we have not been deprived of basketball since the Golden State Warriors’ 4-2 NBA Finals victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. From the NBA Draft, Free Agency, Summer League, Pro-Am tournaments, the Drew League, FIBA basketball and more it was an entertaining offseason leading up to now.</p>\n<p>A lack of defense and half-hearted play are the primary reasons many NBA players put up points in the 50s, 60s, 70s and more in these recreational summer league games. But the joy of these traditional five-on-five, my guys versus your guys, blacktop type of atmosphere that lives in these games is so enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Sure, the most minutes that a starting lineup might play during the preseason is the first quarter, but seeing the newest free agent signees, rookies, even the newest uniforms and sneakers on the court brings about an abundance of exhilarating emotions.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of a fan who genuinely admires the game of basketball, the most enticing thing about the return of NBA basketball is the fact that its best players will finally all be back healthy. As Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James and Anthony Davis each dominated the 2014-2015 season, and a well-deserved MVP was awarded to Chef Curry, things just weren’t the same without the Black Mamba and Durantula on the court.</p>\n<p>It has been a while since the NBA’s best players have all been healthy at the same time, and this season may be the first time in a long time that we get to witness the association’s top players night in and night out.<br>\nKobe Bryant’s field goal percentage suffered from all of his shot attempts, but the Mamba definitely has something left in the tank entering his 20th season. Can you honestly say that you expected Kobe to average 22.3 points per game, which at the time was third-best in the NBA, after tearing his Achilles in 2013 only to return and play in just six games before fracturing a bone near his left knee?</p>\n<p>Watching him and second overall pick D’Angelo Russell play on the same court in the Lakers’ preseason debut against the Utah Jazz was exciting despite Bryant’s 1-of-5 shooting performance in 12 minutes. All eyes are on the Lake Show and if they can rekindle the dynasty’s winning ways in hopes of sending Kobe off with one last playoff appearance in what may be the end of his illustrious career.</p>\n<p>I refuse to let this so-called “beef” between Stephen A. Smith and Kevin Durant spoil my anticipation of the 2014 MVP’s return to the hardwood. While Russell Westbrook had one of the best post-All-Star break performances, earning 11 triple-doubles, the absence of Durant definitely limited the Oklahoma City Thunder in their chase for the eighth seed. After reinjuring a jones fracture in his foot for the second time, causing him to miss 55 games last season, Durant was finally fully cleared for training camp this season and should be in the team’s starting lineup for the regular season.</p>\n<p>The Thunders’ first preseason game was yesterday. Durant played 22 minutes in the team’s preseason opener, scoring 15 points while shooting 5-of-8 from the field.</p>\n<p>Although not mentioned earlier, let’s hope that Derrick Rose’s fractured left orbital is the last of his injuries. Talent such as his is rare as Rose is the youngest MVP in NBA history.</p>\n<p>The 2015-2016 NBA season opens on Tuesday, October 27th. A total of three games are scheduled: Atlanta Hawks vs Detroit Pistons at 5:00 p.m. and playoff rematches between the Chicago Bulls hosting the Cleveland Cavaliers at 5:00 p.m. along with the Golden State Warriors vs the New Orleans Pelicans at 7:30 p.m.<br>\nBe sure to follow us on Twitter @thenexus_sports and expect more content from Around the NBA throughout the season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65100\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/the-return-2015-16-nba-season-close-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65100\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/the-return-2015-16-nba-season-close-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/the-return-2015-16-nba-season-close-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/the-return-2015-16-nba-season-close-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/the-return-2015-16-nba-season-close-up/","id":3299,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3298,3297,3296],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Suffers Third Straight Conference Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 3-1 loss to CSUN puts the Gauchos in a difficult position through three games in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65009\" style=\"width: 292px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GirlsVB_October-02-2015_BRANDT-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1703263172\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65022\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65009\" data-attachment-id=\"65009\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/alexis-rottman-tips-the-ball-over-the-net-spencer-brandtdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GirlsVB_October-02-2015_BRANDT-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Spencer Brandt\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Alexis Rottman tips the ball over the net.

Spencer Brandt/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>While losing isn’t an embracing result, a team’s attitude after its loss definitely influences its performance on the court. Despite falling to 4-10 and 0-3 in conference, the demeanor of the UCSB women’s volleyball team remains resolute as it continues to search for its first win in nine games.</p>\n<p>Through just three games, Santa Barbara has now faced the top three programs in the Big West. It managed to win the opening sets in both of its matches, but became prone to allowing various scoring stretches, which led to UCSB losing three consecutive final sets to end the game in its two home conference openers. Missing from UCSB’s starting lineup this weekend were two of its most prominent players in redshirt senior Hanna Nielson and sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman.</p>\n<p>Prior to the beginning of Big West play, Cal State Northridge was once in the same losing quandary as the Gauchos. The Matadors entered conference play with an eight-game losing streak but have recently been the most astounding team, winning its first two conference matchups. CSUN overcame its early set loss and improved to an undefeated three wins in conference, beating UCSB 3-1 in set scores of 25-27, 25-14, 25-20 and 25-20. The Matadors are now 4-12 overall with a 3-1 Big West record after losing to Cal Poly yesterday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Matadors seemed destined to win the initial set, facing set-point with a 24-21 lead that led to a UCSB timeout. Yet, the quick break benefited UCSB as it made a substitution that put senior opposite Britton Taylor in the game. The change in rotation was the starting point in the Gauchos’ comeback as Taylor thumped the ball for a kill, trimming the deficit to two at 22-24. Back-to-back kills by freshman Annie Hasselmann and junior Elizabeth Sheffield put the finishing touches on Santa Barbara’s 6-1 run, securing the set victory 27-25.</p>\n<p>After achieving a .381 hitting clip in the first set, UCSB’s offense continued to prosper as it opened the second set with a 4-0 run. But Northridge responded with a 6-0 rally of its own to take a 6-4 lead and force a Santa Barbara timeout. The Matadors never lost the lead again and a 9-3 run locked a 25-14 second set win.</p>\n<p>During the second set and latter periods of the match, there was some displeasure expressed by UCSB Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch toward the officiating. Specifically, her complaints were directed toward the line judge for some calls that seemed to favor the Matadors as they went on to win sets three and four.</p>\n<p>When asked if the calls had an influence on the match’s result: “it had an influence on some of the frustrations, but we’ve got to clean up our side of the ball and that’s something uncontrollable that we can’t worry about,” she said. “We played great in set one, we hit over .300 which is excellent. We have to realize that teams are going to adjust and we have to be more adaptable. We have to be quicker to adjust and I think that was something that hurt us tonight.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended Friday’s match with a .164 hitting average while CSUN managed to hit a clip of .200 plus throughout the match’s entirety (.323 match average). Senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson led the Matadors’ assertive attack with a match-high 19 kills. Northridge’s best hitting performance appeared in the fourth set — it clinched victory with a dominant .448 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>A repeat of last season’s 16-0 conference record is now fictitious for No. 24 Long Beach State after being upset 3-1 by Cal Poly on Friday, snapping the 49ers’ 23-match Big West winning streak. However, LBSU accepted the loss and is back to its winning ways after its 3-1 victory over UCSB. Long Beach bounced back for the win in sets of 18-25, 25-19, 26-24 and 25-12.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65008\" style=\"width: 276px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"938735734\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65022\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65008\" data-attachment-id=\"65008\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/shauna-klein-receives-the-ball-from-her-opponent-steven-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Shauna Klein receives the ball from her opponent.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>UCSB managed to take advantage of the vulnerable 49ers in the first set of Saturday’s contest. A 9-4 run set the tone for its offense — three-straight service aces by Sheffield helped Santa Barbara finish the opening set with a .452 hitting clip. UCSB maintained its lead, but LBSU trimmed the deficit to four-points at 15-19, which led to a Santa Barbara timeout. It helped prevent a shift in momentum which led to the Gauchos’ protecting their lead and earning the 18-25 set victory.</p>\n<p>Hoping to avoid consecutive upset losses, Long Beach State answered back with a 25-19 win in the second set. Starting the third set with a 7-1 run, Santa Barbara inched closer to a 2-1 lead. But the 49ers’ 8-2 run notched the score at 9-9. A series of lead changes and ties would occur, when tied 24-24, kills by freshman outside hitter Megan Kruidhof and freshman libero Mykah Wilson snagged the 26-24 third set victory for Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>The results of the third set proved to be the deciding factor in yesterday’s match. “They started taking more chances with their serve and we couldn’t answer — we got stuck in a couple rotations,” Lantagne Welch said. “We need to be able to answer quicker because we were in control of that set.”</p>\n<p>In spite of double-digit kill performances by seniors Ali Barbeau and Taylor, as well as 39 assists by freshman setter Annie Hasselmann , the 49ers’ stunning .625 hitting percentage in the match’s final set stamped their victory. LBSU sits at 13-4, 3-1  in conference play.</p>\n<p>UCSB finds itself on the road for weekday and weekend matchups. The Gauchos will face UC Davis this Thursday, Oct. 8 at 7:00 p.m. at The Pavilion. On Saturday, Oct. 10, they will visit Cal Poly for a 7:00 p.m. match in Robert A.

During non-conference play, the Gauchos averaged a .206 hitting clip. However, in their conference opener, they achieved a dismal .121 hitting percentage. Since losing 3-1 to SMU, the Gauchos have not had two players record double digit kills in the same contest.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing is we just have to keep getting better,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “If we keep getting better, we’re going to start to see the results we want in terms of the scoreboard.”</p>\n<p>Despite having just one win prior to the start of Big West play, Northridge has triumphantly kicked off its conference schedule. The Matadors, now 3-11, are on a two-game winning streak after sweeping UC Irvine and a 3-1 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Through just two conference games, CSUN sits atop the Big West in various statistical categories. Northridge currently leads the conference in kills (110), kills per set (15.71), assists (100), assists per set (14.29), and points (135.0).</p>\n<p>Bearing the offensive torch for the Matadors is senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson. She has been a key centerpiece to CSUN’s progression as she leads the team in kills (182) and blocks (24). Stinson has recorded double-digit kills in nine of Northridge’s games, and just this past Monday was named Big West Women’s Volleyball Player of the Week. A well-deserved honor, as Stinson is coming off a weekend in which she tallied a total of 39 kills and averaged 5.57 kills per set to compliment a smashing .423 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Molding into Northridge’s next elite star at the outside hitter position is freshman Aeryn Owens. Despite a meager .127 hitting average so far this season, she ranks second in CSUN’s kills total with 111. Since the award’s creation prior to the 2014 season, Owens became the first Matador to receive the Big West Freshman of the Week award after chalking up 29 kills and a .313 hitting percentage in the team’s first two conference matches.</p>\n<p>The reigning champions of the Big West Conference, Cal State Long Beach has its eyes set on a repeat performance of its undefeated, 16-0 conference record of last season. Currently 12-3, the 49ers are off to an emphatic start at 2-0 after last weekend’s home conference opener.</p>\n<p>Cal State Long Beach’s determined foundation of players certainly helped pave the way for the 49ers’ success. Last season’s Big West Player of the Year, senior Jenelle Hudson became just the second setter in CSULB history to earn the award. She currently leads the Big West in assists with a total of 587 and sits second in assists per set with 10.30.</p>\n<p>Sophomore middle blocker Ashley Murray was also recognized for her performance in last year’s remarkable run as she was the recipient of the 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year award. Aiding Murray at the middle blocker position is Ball State transfer, senior Hayley Benson. She recently earned Big West Defensive Player of the Week after tallying seven blocks and two blocks per set in the 49ers conference opener.</p>\n<p>Despite preparing for its second and third conference games of the season, the stakes are slowly heightening for UCSB as a win could reinvigorate the Gauchos’ hopes this season.</p>\n<p>“Right now our focus is first on CSUN and then we’ll look at Long Beach as well,” Lantagne Welch said. “It comes down to the process. Let’s put together what we did well this weekend and add a little bit more to it. We have the advantage of playing at home and the students are now back, and that could have a lot of stuff go in our favor.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB versus Cal State Northridge will proceed at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow, Following the Gauchos’ Friday bout is their Saturday match versus No. 24 Cal State Long Beach. Both games will be played in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/","id":5098,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5097,5096,5095],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Inconsistencies Too Costly in Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's volleyball opened its conference schedule with a road contest against No. 11 Hawai'i.

We did that at times, we just didn’t sustain it.”</p>\n<p>Last season marked the end of the Rainbow Wahine’s illustrious streak of 19 consecutive conference championships, a winning stretch that combined their success in both the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and Big West conferences, respectively. With this year’s pre-season prediction to earn a first-place finish in the Big West poll, it was a prominent first step for a Hawaii team that is determined to regain its conference notoriety. The Rainbow Wahine improved to 12-1 and are now 2-0 versus Big West opponents after sweeps of UCSB and Cal Poly this weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nearly 7,000 people filled Hawaii’s Stan Sheriff Center on Friday, indicating the long-awaited conference opener. Despite the daunting atmosphere, UCSB managed to hold its ground in the match’s beginning.</p>\n<p>A combination of kills, one service ace and one assisted block helped Santa Barbara go on an early 5-2 run. Still, a mentally well-equipped team like Hawaii did not panic as it rallied back with a 4-0 run of its own, taking a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s lead remained at a tight margin, but a kill by junior opposite Nikki Taylor triggered the team’s offensive surge to close the set. Up 15-12, Taylor’s attack sparked Hawaii’s 10-1 run to win the game’s first set, taking the 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In spite of the one-set deficit, UCSB continued to trade points with Hawaii in the opening of the second set. Yet, tied 7-7, Santa Barbra’s inability to limit its self-inflicted mistakes contributed to the Rainbow Wahine having a match-best .452 hitting clip. Hawaii surely benefited from its attacking success as it went on two 6-0 runs, the second scoring spurt gave the Rainbow Wahine a 23-12 lead. Helping capture the 25-14 set win were two kills by junior setter Tayler Higgins and sophomore middle hitter Emily Maglio.</p>\n<p>UCSB remained motivated in its quest to trim Hawaii’s lead. While the Gauchos’ ongoing errors persisted in the match’s last set, their offense improved to a team-high .258 hitting percentage. Three different Gauchos tallied a total of six kills, while sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman led UCSB in kills for the fourth straight match with seven.</p>\n<p>Still, Hawaii’s outstanding hitting stretch continued as it registered a .433 clip. Leading the Rainbow Wahine was an imposing performance by Higgins. Last week’s espnW Player of the Week, Higgins tallied a match-high 14 kills to go along with a .464 hitting night.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii outhit UCSB, freshman libero Emilia Petrachi logged a match-high 19 digs. However, it was Santa Barbara’s insufficiency at the net that plagued its defense. While UCSB had no blocking errors, the Gauchos blocked just six of Hawaii’s attacking attempts. Not only were the Rainbow Wahine able to capitalize offensively, but they also strived on defense with a total of 19 blocks. In addition to Maglio’s eight kills and .615 hitting clip, she notched a match-high of six blocks to help Hawaii win the final set, 25-19.</p>\n<p>Certainly the Rainbow Wahines’ performance on both sides of the net must be acknowledged, but UCSB’s errors proved too costly against a powerhouse program like Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I think Hawaii is a great team. They have no real weakness and they had a huge size advantage on us,” Lantagne Welch said. “I actually thought we played better than the score indicated. If you hit .300 against just about any team you’re gonna win. We just didn’t put enough pressure on them or their offense. We didn’t serve tough at all and we let them off the hook that way.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to the Thunderdome this Friday, Oct. 2nd to host its conference home opener versus Cal State Northridge at 7:00 p.m. UCSB continues its home stand with a match versus No. 25 Long Beach State on Saturday, Oct. 3rd at 7:00 p.m. as well.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

unpredictability of college sports is an element that cannot be found elsewhere. The rush of emotions that occur while watching an underdog triumphantly upset a top team is always an achievement that is remembered.</p>\n<p>Friday, Oct. 11, 2013 is a date in UCSB women’s volleyball history that remains relevant. In her first year as Gaucho Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch helped lead Santa Barbara to a 3-2 upset victory over No. 5 Hawaii. This Friday is a pivotal opportunity for UCSB to recreate history in its Big West conference season opener against No. 11 Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the challenge, and obviously we need to progress this week in practice. We definitely need to get our confidence at a stronger, stable point to go into their place,” Lantagne Welch said. “There’s some eerily similar things to two years ago. We were struggling in the pre-conference and not doing so great, and we went over to the islands and upset them. We know that you gotta get out there and play the game and we’re excited to do that and it’s a great opportunity for us.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara enters Stan Sheriff Center with a 4-7 overall record, and is set to face a Hawaii team that is in full stride and on pace for a special season. The Gauchos certainly have a challenging task ahead of them as they are 0-2 versus Top 25 opponents this season. The Rainbow Wahine are currently 10-1 overall, and are hoping to extend their five-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB comes into its conference opener with a chip on its shoulder as it has yet to end its disheartening losing stretch of six games. Overcoming this frustrating streak will be no easy task as the Gauchos prepare to face one of the nation’s best players in Nikki Taylor.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine’s junior opposite is having a captivating year in which she has earned an array of awards and accolades at the season’s midpoint. Through just 11 matches, she is now Hawaii’s record setter for most Big West Player of the Week Awards after earning three straight, was rewarded Sports Imports/AVCA Division I National Player of the Week honors and became the first player in Rainbow Wahine history to receive the espnW National Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>While Taylor is having a standout year, Hawaii as a collective group has played spectacularly on the court. The Rainbow Wahine are flourishing in making their case as the Big West’s top team as they lead six of the conference’s seven statistical categories.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to spoil Hawaii’s winning record, the Gauchos’ must maintain a consistent balance on both sides of the ball. They rank second in the conference in service aces per set at 1.41, are tied for first in solo blocks with 24, third with an average of 2.32 blocks per set and are second in the league with the least amount of errors at 198.</p>\n<p>As long as Santa Barbara does not allow Hawaii to force it into playing against their strengths, the chances of UCSB upsetting the Rainbow Wahine become more realistic. The beginning of conference play presents the Gauchos with a great opportunity to disregard their early-season stumble with hopes of improvement.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a couple of rough games, but now with starting conference we get to travel to Hawaii and play a really great team. I think it’s a great time to show what we’ve got and have a new fresh start,” sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman said. “We have to go into practice with the mentality that we’re going to get better every day because you can’t just keep saying it or you’ll never improve.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s conference season-opener against No. 11 Hawaii will take place on the road this Friday, Sept. 25th at 10 p.m. PT, 7 p.m. HST.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of September 24, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64793\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64793\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/womens-volleyball-on-hunt-for-upset-in-conference-opener/","id":5317,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5316,5315,5314],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Round Up: Week 2 Review","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/romo-collarbone-355x230.jpe","mobile_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/romo-collarbone.jpe","description":"Sports Editor Sean White contributes his thoughts on Week 2 of the 2015 NFL season to the Nexus Sports Online Focus.

Manning is now 14-1 in his career against KC, and joined Hall of Famer Brett Favre as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to throw for more than 70,000 career passing yards. It was an exceptional night from Peyton as he completed 26 of 45 pass attempts, threw for 256 yards, 3 touchdowns, and one pick. However, while Peyton had a milestone night, the Broncos’ defense carried Denver to its victory as they forced three fumbles and had one interception. As if running backs couldn’t receive any more scrutiny after what took place in Seattle and the Meadowlands in Week 1, the shenanigans continued with the Chiefs’ Jamaal Charles. Despite gaining 21 rushing attempts, 125 yards, and one TD, Charles fumbled twice. As we all expected OT, Charles’ hands thought otherwise as he coughed it up with 36 seconds left in regulation which led to the go-ahead scoop and score for the Broncos’ 31-24 win. Sorry Chiefs’ fans, but beating Peyton just might not be meant to be.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Mr. Brady definitely took note of that as he torched Buffalo throwing for 466 yards and three TD’s, the most passing yards allowed in a single-game in Bills history, to lead his team to its 40-32 victory. Apparently the Bills’ needed “King Kong” like Ryan mentioned because the Patriots’ clinic didn’t stop there as “Gronkmania” (yes I just made that up), could not be stopped. Gronkowski had seven receptions to go along with 113 yards and a touchdown. It was a great comeback effort by the Bills, but when your quarterback throws three interceptions against a team, who in my opinion has the best QB in the league, chances are you are going to lose. It’s quite simple: Turnovers = more time for Brady on the field = TD’s for Brady and the Pats.</p>\n<p><strong>Cowboys’ Win, but lose Romo</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"489146748\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64761\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/cowboys/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=2000%2C1903&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1903\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cowboys\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=888%2C845&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64678 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=158%2C150\" alt=\"Cowboys\" width=\"158\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=1024%2C974&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Entering this season, many had Head Coach Chip Kelly and the Philadelphia Eagles as the favorites to win the NFC East. But with the Eagles’ sitting at 0-2 after a 20-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, it leaves the door wide open for a 2-0 Dallas team that is eagerly hoping to make a deeper playoff run after nearly making the NFC Championship game last year. It was a fundamental win for the Cowboys as they dominated the time of possession battle, having the ball for 40:30 in comparison to the Eagles’ insufficient time of 19:30. As if things couldn’t get any worse for the Cowboys’ after losing Dez Bryant to a broken foot, the injury troubles continue as quarterback Tony Romo suffered a fractured left collarbone in the third quarter of Sunday’s game. It’s fortunate that Romo doesn’t need surgery to heal the break, but the Cowboys’ Super Bowl chances are definitely slimmer with his absence as he is expected to miss the next eight weeks. Don’t count them out though as Brandon Weeden went seven for seven for 73 yards and a TD, then again, the Cowboys’ did already have a 13-3 lead so we’ll just have to wait and see what he can do in a game’s entirety.</p>\n<p><strong>Winston wins in the Bayou</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1849514025\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64761\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64765\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/bucs/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bucs\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64765 alignright\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=170%2C170\" alt=\"bucs\" width=\"170\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Despite a horrendous debut versus the Tennessee Titans in Week 1, No. 1 draft pick Jameis Winston redeemed himself on the road against the New Orleans Saints, helping lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to their 26-19 win, and earning his first career victory.

Throwing for 172 yards and two touchdowns off of an 8 for 15 passing night, Manziel played well after a subpar game in Week 1. It seems like he may have found his favorite receiving target in Travis Benjamin, who had three receptions for 115 yards and two TD’s.

With the offseason acquisitions of Frank Gore, Andre Johnson, and more, it’s surprising to see the team that many predicted to play in Santa Clara next February off to another slow start. Unfortunately for Indianapolis, Andrew Luck has yet to play like the “elite” QB he’s labeled to be. He was responsible for four of the team’s five turnovers as he threw three interceptions and lost one fumble. But, recognition must be given to the New York Jets’ defense as it shutout the Colts’ in the first half, and currently lead the NFL in takeaways with 10.  The Jets’ receiving duo of Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker flamed the Colts’ secondary for a combined total of 15 receptions, 198 yards, and two touchdowns. Of course the blame can’t only be n Luck, especially after a costly fumble by Gore at the two-yard line and Indianapolis’ inconsistent play on defense, but as the leader of this franchise Luck must improve his performance on the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64761\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64761\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/","id":3290,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3289,3288,3287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Winless Troubles Continue in Non-Conference Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Volleyball_Kenneth-Song_for-10.20.2014-1608.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Volleyball_Kenneth-Song_for-10.20.2014-1608.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's losing streak extends to six-games after losses against Loyola Marymount and San Diego.

The Gauchos are now 4-7 overall, and are hoping that the start to Big West play will be an uplifting phase of their season.</p>\n<p>It was a thrilling opening to the Gauchos’ weekend as they battled with Loyola Marymount in a five-set showdown. Able to secure the match’s last two sets, the Lions would go on to earn the 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>The offensive firepower of both teams was on full display as each traded points in the game’s first set. Tied at 22-22, it was UCSB’s attack that allowed it to win the set as the Gauchos’ recorded three-consecutive kills. Aiding Santa Barbara in its closing of the set was its efficient pursuit as it had just one attacking error.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While the Gauchos’ managed to surpass LMU in the first set, the Lions’ achieved their best hitting clip of the night, a game-high of .464 in the second set. After nearly capturing the victory in the first set, Loyola Marymount did not allow the loss to linger as it opened the new set with a 7-1 run. Helping create these high-percentage attacks for LMU was the marvelous setting performance of senior Hannah Tedrow as she registered a total of 53 assists.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, its number of errors equaled its total of kills, resulting in a .000 hitting percentage. However, Santa Barbara redeemed itself by earning its best hitting-clip of the night at .364 and never allowed LMU to gain the lead during the entire third period.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s ability to gain an early lead was vital as it eventually led to the Gauchos’ largest lead of the set at a score of 19-10. The Lions’ trimmed UCSB’s lead to as low as two at a score of 22-24, but were unable to fully overcome the deficit.</p>\n<p>Down two sets to one, it was only a matter of time until LMU’s lethal trio of hitters would emerge. Led by an arsenal of players who each have more than 120 kills, the Lions’ offensive attack overwhelmed the Gauchos in the game’s last two sets.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Rachelle Suaava, outside hitters junior Jamie Lea and sophomore Sarah Sponcil combined for a total of 46 of the team’s 67 kills. Sponcil had a sensational performance as she recorded 23 kills, 10 digs, and five service aces.</p>\n<p>UCSB responded with some offense of its own as sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman led Santa Barbara in kills with 10. Balancing Santa Barbara’s attack was its exceptional play at the net. The Gauchos’ defense ended the evening with a total of 21 blocks, junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield was responsible for a match-high eight. Still, the Gauchos’ efforts were not enough as their winless streak continued and the Lions’ improved to 7-3 overall.</p>\n<p>In spite of the team’s latest winning drought, its remains with the utmost confidence. “We try to think of every game as a fresh new start,” Hoffman said. “It doesn’t matter if we lost or even won the last game, all that matters is that there is a new game ahead, and a new opportunity to bring everything we have to the court.”</p>\n<p>Concluding the Gauchos’ non-conference schedule was their Saturday bout versus San Diego State. Despite being swept 3-0, UCSB did not oblige to the Aztecs’ victory as it did not go down without another hard-fought performance in the match’s final two extra-point sets.</p>\n<p>Trailing 14-22 in the second set, Santa Barbara’s 10-2 rally helped tie the score at 24-24. A total of six lead changes would occur from that point on, but a costly UCSB service error and a timely block by SDSU’s defense resulted in the Aztecs’ 31-29 set victory.</p>\n<p>On the verge of being swept, UCSB retaliated with a commanding start of its own. It opened the third set with a 10-3 run, and seemed destined to play another set. Guiding the Gauchos’ potential comeback was Hoffman, who had a team-high 10 kills while sophomore libero Sydney Bast recorded a career-high 18 digs.</p>\n<p>But, the Gauchos’ hot streak didn’t last long as San Diego State would go on a 10-2 run of its own to take a 18-16 lead. Leading the three-time Mountain West champions was freshman outside hitter Alexandra Psoma as she finished with a match-high 12 kills. Both teams continued to swap points, but it was another Aztecs’ block by middle blockers senior Kaja Sandberg and junior Emma Fuzie that sealed the team’s 29-27 win, allowing SDSU to improve to an overall record of 3-8.</p>\n<p>Certainly the past two weekends have been frustrating for UCSB, but the Gauchos’ plan on leaving the adversity of their non-conference games in the past as they prepare for their first conference game of the season.</p>\n<p>“The big thing in our favor right now is we actually start a new season today,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said. “We’re moving into Big West play, and everyone is 0-0. I think that can be extremely motivating for us, everyone has a clean slate and we’re starting fresh. We can just build from that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opens its conference schedule on the road against No. 11 Hawai’i this Friday, Sept. 25<sup>th</sup> at 10 p.m. PT, 7 p.m. HST.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div

Through nine games, the Gauchos are 4-5 overall and are hoping to overcome their latest four-game losing skid.</p>\n<p>In her third season, Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch is hoping to bounce back from a near average year in which UCSB finished 13-14 overall, 8-8 in conference.</p>\n<p>Despite its current winless streak, UCSB is a team with much potential. The Gauchos entered this season with the 18th-best recruiting class in the nation and a third-place Big West preseason ranking. For a roster with only five seniors, this season has provided the Gauchos’ younger, developing talent with much playing time.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Attempting to fill the vacancy of former Gaucho setter Ali Spindt, freshman Annie Hasselmann has held her ground. Though still adapting to the collegiate level, Hasselmann has been productive on the court with a total of 157 assists and an average of 4.76 assists per set.</p>\n<p>Helping ease the transition for Hasselmann is redshirt senior setter Hanna Nielson. Although she has statistically outperformed the young setter with 179 assists and an average of 5.42 assists per set, shet has been a great influence on Hasselmann’s growth.</p>\n<p>Turning those assists into points is the remarkable offense of senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau. UCSB’s leader on the court as a senior captain, Barbeau is on pace for another outstanding season. A two-time All-Big West First Team selection, she leads UCSB in kills with 105 and owns a team-high average of 3.18 kills per set. She has accomplished career-highs in kills (15) and digs (18) so far this season.</p>\n<p>In addition to the prolific attack provided by Barbeau is the offensive precision of another veteran player like senior opposite Britton Taylor. Behind Barbeau for the team-high in kills at 65, Taylor’s efficiency when attacking has been consistent as she has a .271 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have been solid offensively, UCSB’s defense has quietly exceeded the expectations of many. The unexpected emergence of freshman libero Emilia Petrachi as one of the Big West’s top performers has been admirable. A vital piece in the Gauchos’ playmaking defensively, Petrachi ranks second in-conference in digs per set (4.35) and fourth in total digs (135). Overall, Santa Barbara has done well defending the attack as it is second in the Big West in digs per set with 15.36.</p>\n<p>Another underrated aspect of the Gauchos’ defensive force has been its blocking. A total of 77 blocks and 2.33 blocks per set, UCSB’s defense at the net has been superb.</p>\n<p>Junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield have been essential to Santa Barbara’s defensive front. Both ranking top 10 in blocks per set, the duo is responsible for 70 of the team’s total blocks. They’ve been helpful on the offensive side as well as Grunt’s .284 attacking clip and Sheffield’s .341 hitting percentage rank among the top 10 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With just two non-conference games left, hope is still alive for UCSB as it has the opportunity to gain some momentum with another home-based invitational this weekend. The Gauchos will be co-hosting the UCSB/Cal Poly Tournament.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the two rivals will not face each other just yet, but Santa Barbara’s first matchup will be versus Loyola Marymount at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s home stand ends with a Saturday afternoon match against San Diego State at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This article appeared on page 13 of September 17, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64665\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64665\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/w-vball/","id":5151,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5150,5149,5148],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set to Host in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.24.2014-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.24.2014-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos welcome some of nation's best to the Thunderdome ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Thunderdome will be live and energetic this weekend as the UCSB women’s volleyball team prepares to host its first tournament of the 2015 season.

The driving force behind SMU’s prosperous rise is senior setter Avery Acker.</p>\n<p>A two-time All-American Honorable Mention, Acker leads the American Athletic Conference in assists per set with 11.96. She helped the Mustangs win their five-set battle versus New Mexico last Saturday with a season-high 58 assists. Her career total of 3,000 plus assists ranks her sixth all-time in SMU history.</p>\n<p>Another key counterpart to the Mustangs success is junior Morgan Heise. The 2014 American Athletic Libero of the Year, Heise set an SMU single-season record with 626 digs. The Mustangs 17.70 digs per set ties them with UCF for a conference-high this season.</p>\n<p>Expect another MVP-esque performance from senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau to combat SMU’s fierce defense. The Yale Invitational Co-MVP, Barbeau leads the Gauchos in kills with 81 and is just one dig away from being tied for second on the team at 58 after recording a career-high 18 digs against Yale.</p>\n<p>“Our serving improved, which helps our defense,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said. “It puts more pressure on other teams and makes it easier for our defense to set up for digs and blocks.”</p>\n<p>Next on Santa Barbara’s schedule is the University of San Diego. UCSB’s first ranked opponent, the 5-1 Toreros are also on a four-game winning run after hosting its own invitational last weekend.</p>\n<p>Leading USD in its superb home performance was redshirt junior middle blocker Lisa Kramer. She was awarded with All-Tournament honors after accumulating a total of 30 kills, 12 blocks, and a .397 hitting percentage. Kramer is currently tied for the team-lead in attacking percentage at a clip of .286.</p>\n<p>Having a breakout season for San Diego is junior middle blocker Lauren Schad. She finished last weekend with a total of 19 blocks and owns a team-high of 38. Her mastery of the block ranks her at the top of the West Coast Conference as she averages 1.68 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>Securing the net for the Gauchos are junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield. Grunt’s 6’4” stature along with Sheffield’s vertical bounce have complimented each other well so far this year. The two have combined for a total of 48 blocks this season.</p>\n<p>Since losing last week’s tournament finale to Rhode Island, UCSB has been more proactive in preparing for its upcoming matches.</p>\n<p>“We really pinpointed certain things that we need to work on to make sure that we don’t make the same errors again,” Sheffield said. “We’re going to make sure that we figure out what those teams are really good at doing and make sure that we can shut it down.”</p>\n<p>Ending the Gauchos’ home debut is a contest versus UCLA. The Bruins’ come into UCSB with a 4-1 overall record and are on a three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>As one of eight nationally ranked teams from a talented Pac-12 Conference, UCLA will be no easy exit for the Gauchos. A transfer from West Virginia this offseason, junior outside hitter Jordan Anderson has been an absolute stud in her first season as a Bruin. Her efficiency when attacking has been valuable to UCLA’s offense as she ranks third in the Pac-12 in kills per set averaging 4.38.</p>\n<p>UCSB definitely has its work cut out for itself this weekend. Some may consider UCSB to be the underdog even on home territory, but should not be underestimated when playing in the Thunderdome as the possibility of an upset awaits.</p>\n<p>UCSB starts its invitational tomorrow, Sept. 11<sup>th</sup> at 7 p.m. versus SMU. Followed by a Saturday match versus No. 18 USD at 4 p.m., and a Sunday bout versus No. 17 UCLA at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64654\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64654\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/","id":4988,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[4987,4986,4985],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Impressive at Yale Invitational, Land Three on All-Tournament Team","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-Ali-Barbeau-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-Ali-Barbeau-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.12.2014-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Another quick start for women's volleyball ends with tough loss in extra sets ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite ending its trip to the East Coast with a loss, it was another progressive weekend for the UCSB women’s volleyball team.

After getting off to a sluggish start, UCSB played with a vengeance as it won three straight sets to earn the 3-1 victory: 24-26, 25-15, 25-19, and 28-26.</p>\n<p>The intensity of Friday’s match was at its peak as both teams traded points in the game’s early stages. It wasn’t until the Gauchos’ broke a 12-12 tie with the Owls that they were able to establish a comfortable lead. A 4-0 UCSB run allowed the Gauchos’ to take a 16-12 lead, which led to a Rice timeout.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Stepping up early for the Gauchos with her aggressive attack was senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva as she ended the evening with a total of 12 kills and 14 digs.</p>\n<p>Determined to neutralize the shift in momentum, the Owls comeback was ignited late in the first set. Down 15-20, Rice recorded three consecutive kills to force a UCSB timeout. Along with two service errors by the Gauchos, Rice ended up going on a 5-0 run to tie the score at 20-20, leading to another Santa Barbara timeout.</p>\n<p>Eventually the two teams would be tied 24-24, but a UCSB service error and service ace by junior outside hitter Leah Mikesky helped Rice earn the 26-24 win.</p>\n<p>Not a consistent factor in the match’s beginning, the emergence of senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau as the game unfolded was perfect timing for the Gauchos’ takeover. Barbeau put on one of her best performances to date, earning her first double-double of the season with 15 kills, 14 digs, and five blocks.</p>\n<p>Helping the Gauchos’ seal the second and third sets was their persistent defense. UCSB restricted the Rice offense to .061 and .118 hitting percentages over the two sets.</p>\n<p>Continuing her sensational performance from last weekend, freshman libero Emilia Petrachi had a match-high 18 digs. Through two tournaments, Petrachi ranks second in the Big West Conference in digs with 99.</p>\n<p>It was a hardcore duel in the fourth set as the Owls attempted to prevent UCSB from closing the game. Despite achieving its best hitting percentage of .375 in the game’s last set, Rice was conquered by the Gauchos’ .432 hitting clip. UCSB’s ability to outhit the Owls led to the Gauchos’ winning the set 28-26 to end the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB sustained its quality start in Saturday’s bout versus Yale. The Gauchos defeated the Bulldogs 25-16, 25-20, 15-15, and 25-10 for a 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>With the game’s first two sets belonging to the Gauchos, it was another stunning performance by Barbeau as she led Santa Barbara for the second consecutive time in kills with 15 and notched a match-high 18 digs.</p>\n<p>Making the transition from outside hitter to middle blocker this offseason, junior Elizabeth Sheffield has been a consistent centerpiece for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>She has been the Gauchos’ balance on both offense and defense. Against Yale, Sheffield was responsible for 17 of the Gauchos’ points as she showcased her versatility with eight kills, seven service aces, and three blocks. She currently ranks second in the Big West in hitting percentage at .432.</p>\n<p>A well-deserving candidate, Sheffield’s performance at the Yale Invitational earned her All-Tournament team honors.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really cool that I was recognized for that,” she said. “But, I feel like everyone did so well that I think it’s ridiculous to say that I deserved it over someone else because everyone on our team contributed.”</p>\n<p>Despite being down two sets to none, Yale did not concede to the UCSB sweep. The Bulldogs managed to rally with a 6-0 run to take a 20-12 lead that paved the way for a 25-15 win in the third set.</p>\n<p>Senior setter Kelly Johnson and freshman outside hitter Kelley Wirth tied for a team-high 10 kills. But, the Bulldogs’ effort wasn’t enough to contain the Gauchos .542 hitting percentage in the fourth set to keep UCSB from winning the match.</p>\n<p>Concluding Santa Barbara’s visit to New Haven was its match against Rhode Island. In a match that went down to the wire with five sets, the Rams persevered for the 3-2 victory. Rhode Island captured the win in sets of 20-25, 25-22, 21-25, 25-15, and 15-12.</p>\n<p>Able to steal the game’s first and third sets, the Gauchos were simply outhit by the Rams. Specifically, the play of senior outside hitter Franki Darnold and junior middle blocker Layne Self seemed unstoppable.</p>\n<p>The two combined for a total of 39 kills as Darnold surpassed the landmark of 1,000 career kills and Layne notched a .571 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>“It was just a situation where it was our last game and they came out harder than us,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said.</p>\n<p>In spite of losing its last match, UCSB had two other players earn All-Tournament honors along with Sheffield. Barbeau was named the invitational’s Co-MVP and sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman made the team after completing 12 of her 16 attacks for a .625 hitting percentage against Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>The Thunderdome will be roaring this weekend as UCSB returns to Santa Barbara to host its own tournament. The Gauchos’ have a game lined up for each day starting this Friday, Sept. 11<sup>th</sup>-13<sup>th</sup>. They will face SMU at 7 p.m., No. 18 USD at 4 p.m., and No. 17 UCLA at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64642\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/gauchos-impressive-at-yale-invitational-land-three-on-all-tournament-team/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64642\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/gauchos-impressive-at-yale-invitational-land-three-on-all-tournament-team/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/gauchos-impressive-at-yale-invitational-land-three-on-all-tournament-team/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/gauchos-impressive-at-yale-invitational-land-three-on-all-tournament-team/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/gauchos-impressive-at-yale-invitational-land-three-on-all-tournament-team/","id":5121,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5120,5119,5118],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels East For Yale Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Another doubleheader invitational for women's volleyball ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58755\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.23.2014-01.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"602829603\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64634\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58755\" data-attachment-id=\"58755\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/gauchos-edged-by-hawaii-on-senior-night/w-volleyball-hawaii-def-ucsb-3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.23.2014-01.jpg?fit=1600%2C1036&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1036\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Freshman outside hitter Chanel Hoffman digs out the ball while teammate Jaylen Villanueva looks on during UCSB's five set loss to the Rainbow Wahine on Friday night.

It’s another busy weekend for the Gauchos as they will face Rice on Friday and are set for a Saturday doubleheader against Yale and Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>Following its performance in Malibu, Santa Barbara hopes for another fast-paced start after consecutive sweeps versus Utah Valley State and Incarnate Word. UCSB enters the Yale Invitational with an overall record of 2-1.</p>\n<p>Heading into New Haven is a hot Owls team that is looking to maintain its three-game winning streak. Currently holding a 3-1 overall record, it has been Rice’s ability to prevail when trailing early in matches that has allowed it to secure games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite losing the first set in two of their last three matches, the Owls have gone on to win. Leading Rice’s comeback successes is the remarkable play of junior outside hitter Leah Mikesky.</p>\n<p>The Owls’ team MVP last season, Mikesky had a total of 407 kills in 2014. She seems to be on the same track as she leads Rice in kills with 59 and ranks third on the team in digs with 39. Mikesky’s ability to produce on both sides of the net has been vital as she is coming off a match-high 17 kills and has a team-high of three double-doubles this season.</p>\n<p>Helping Mikesky shine on the court is the complimenting play of sophomore setter Madison McDaniel. McDaniel has been an absolute stud during Rice’s hot streak, recording 50-plus assists in each of the team’s last three games. Her total of 174 assists this season ranks third in the Conference USA as she averages 10.88 assists per set.</p>\n<p>With potential to produce similar statistics, freshman Annie Hasselmann could be the Gauchos’ next household name at the setter position. Through three games Hasselmann has 53 assists, just three behind redshirt senior Hanna Nielson’s team-high of 56. After an exceptional college debut, Hasselmann believes no limits exist for UCSB and its capabilities this season.</p>\n<p>“I really think that this team has really good potential,” Hasselmann said. “We have that fight. We have really good competitors, and I think that we can take down some tough teams this year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara begins its Saturday doubleheader with a morning matchup against Yale. The Gauchos prepare to face the Ivy League’s best team of the past half-decade.  Dating back to 2010, the Bulldogs are five-time Ivy League champions.</p>\n<p>Yet to play a game this season, the reigning conference champions finished 2014 with an overall record of 18-8. Despite dominating the Ivy League, the Bulldogs didn’t have much success in the postseason as they were swept by Arizona in the first round of last year’s NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara managed to control the tempo in last week’s wins, its loss against Pepperdine displayed the team’s need to be more efficient after 10 errors in the third set.</p>\n<p>“The big thing is we just have to play cleaner volleyball,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said. “I am most looking forward to seeing them get better every match, every game, every point, and just learn from the past play and apply it to the next play. That’s a lot of the early season volleyball, the quick adjustments you can make, and that can help lead to a lot of success.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ends its visit to the East with a match against Rhode Island. The Rams come into the Yale Invitational with a 2-1 overall record and are on a two-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Emerging as Rhode Island’s star player over the past three years, senior outside hitter Franki Darnold is on track for another stellar season. She is just 36 kills away from a total of 1,000 career kills, which would make her the ninth player in Rhode Island history to achieve the benchmark. Darnold ranks second in the Atlantic 10 conference in kills per set at 4.10.</p>\n<p>For senior captain outside hitter Ali Barbeau, in order for UCSB to be successful this weekend, it’s the little things in addition to the team’s performance that matters most.</p>\n<p>“We’ve worked a lot on communication,” Barbeau said. “Making sure we’re aggressive and really sure about who has what role. We’re really working on more energy, more communication, and staying aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opens the Yale Invitational versus Rice at 2 p.m. Friday, Sept. 4<sup>th</sup> and will end the tournament on Saturday, Sept. 5<sup>th</sup>  with matches against Yale at 10 a.m. and Rhode Island at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64634\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64634\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/","id":674,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[673,672,671],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Sweep Two, Drop One In Season Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women's volleyball opens the 2015 season at the Pepperdine Asics Classic","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58837\" style=\"width: 337px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.26.2014-9005.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1800275954\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64605\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58837\" data-attachment-id=\"58837\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-31/womens-volleyball-sweep-two-drop-one-in-season-opener/w-volleyball-by-kenneth-song_for-11-26-2014-9005/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.26.2014-9005.jpg?fit=1200%2C901&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,901\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416605944\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"120\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"W Volleyball by Kenneth Song_for 11.26.2014-9005\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.26.2014-9005.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.26.2014-9005.jpg?fit=888%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58837\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.26.2014-9005.jpg?resize=327%2C246\" alt=\"Redshirt senior setter Hanna Nielson making a diving dig attempt.

The two-time All-Big West First Teamer took matters into her own hands leading the Gauchos’ offensive attack with 17 kills.</p>\n<p>Adding to the scoring firepower provided by Barbeau was junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield. Her nine kills helped UCSB to further establish its offensive presence, but it was her aggressiveness on the defensive end that was most significant. Sheffield’s three blocks were vital in the team holding the Wolverines to a .103 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>While Utah Valley State’s offense was unable to produce, it was the Wolverines’ defense that kept them in contention.</p>\n<p>Leading Utah Valley State’s defensive barrier was the duo of junior outside hitter Kiahna Steiner and senior middle blocker Lauren Bakker. The two combined for a total of 15 blocks to help make up for the team’s lack of offense.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines nearly avoided the UCSB sweep in the match’s third set, but could not capitalize on their lead. Utah Valley State went on a 5-0 run during the last set, and eventually gained a 24-22 lead due to some late-game UCSB errors. Despite trailing, a rally of kills and a service ace by senior defensive specialist Shauna Klein led to the Gauchos’ 26-24 comeback to end the game.</p>\n<p>It was a similar scenario in the Gauchos second match versus Incarnate Word. While Barbeau and Sheffield continued their dominance on the court, senior opposites Jaylen Villanueva and Britton Taylor emerged with solid showings as well. Villanueva led the Gauchos with nine digs as Taylor’s eight kills gave her a game-high .429 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>After losing former UCSB setter Ali Santi, there was some concern if the Gauchos could fill that void. Through two games, redshirt senior Hanna Nielson and freshman Annie Hasselmann have proven that the Gauchos’ core of their rotation will be just fine.</p>\n<p>Hasselmann’s play has shown that her many accolades and milestones entering UCSB are well deserved as she finished day one of the Classic with 31 assists, just two behind Nielson’s 33.In spite of a strong start by the Cardinals in the match’s first two sets, the abundance of errors made by Incarnate Word were too much to recover from.</p>\n<p>Even a game-high of 12 kills by senior outside hitter Angelique Vidaurri was not enough to overcome the Cardinals’ mistakes. However, UCSB’s defense must be applauded as well as it held Incarnate Word to a .074 hitting percentage. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, their inefficiencies on offense led to a third set that resulted in 11 errors and 11 kills for a .000 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>As UCSB and Pepperdine both finished Friday unbeaten, Saturday consisted of two of the tournament’s best teams going head-to-head.</p>\n<p>While the two teams traded the match’s first two sets, a costly third set which resulted in 10 Gaucho errors led to the Waves winning 3-1 with scores of 25-18, 16-25, 25-19, and 25-16 to win the Asics Classic and improve to an overall record of 3-0.</p>\n<p>The Waves’ young trio of freshman middle blocker Tarah Wylie, freshman outside hitters Heidi Dyer and Nikki Lyons carried the load for Pepperdine as they combined for a total of 34 kills. However, it was the hustle play of players such as senior setter Becca Strehlow and Dyer that contributed to the Waves securing the last two sets as Strehlow had 22 digs while Dyer recorded 16.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi put on her best performance as she had a game-high 30 digs. Still, while UCSB had an outstanding second set in which it hit .487 percent, the Gauchos lack of consistency cost themselves the game as they averaged a .197 hitting percentage for the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB will participate in the Yale Invitational this Friday, Sept. 4<sup>th</sup> to face Rice at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

It’s an illness that even the most healthful individual cannot predict to occur in their lifetime.</p>\n<p>For Kansas City Chiefs’ strong safety Eric Berry, week six of the 2014 NFL season will forever be a life-changing experience. On December 8<sup>th</sup>, 2014, news surfaced that Berry was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma.</p>\n<p>After missing the remainder of last season, Berry is set to make his return tomorrow night in the Chiefs preseason opener against the Arizona Cardinals. While it is not determined how much playing time he will receive, Berry has been making encouraging strides in training camp. Just last Thursday, Berry sent the sports world into a frenzy after making a diving interception during practice.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The fifth overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft from the University of Tennessee, Berry has been a relentless force since entering the league. His hard-nosed, aggressive playing style allowed him to have an immediate impact as he earned the starting safety spot in his first season and has excelled ever since.</p>\n<p>Battling cancer is an unfathomable challenge that one can only hope to survive. Berry’s fearless spirit while facing his battle with cancer is exemplary of a courageous warrior disguised as a football player.</p>\n<p>The grueling treatment of chemotherapy is a process that usually causes the physical and psychological strength of cancer stricken individuals to plummet. However, for Berry the time spent during recovery was a period that displayed his dedication and commitment to not surrender.</p>\n<p>During each chemotherapy session, Berry had an IV inserted into his body in order to work out while under treatment. By the end of his treatment, Berry was one pound heavier than when he first was diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Berry’s superhuman abilities may set him aside from others, but he has become another example for people worldwide. His devotion while on his road to recovery is motivation for individuals that are ill or healthy to never take life for granted and to embrace its challenges.</p>\n<p>While Berry’s health and ability to persevere is paramount in him getting back on the field, the NFL’s support during his absence was just as important. Players, fans, and teams all over the league joined in support of the “Berry Strong” campaign. Most notably, t-shirts boasting the slogan of “Be Bold, Be Brave, Be Berry,” became a popular choice of support by many.</p>\n<p>Of course we’re all glad to see the return of football with the NFL preseason, but tomorrow night’s game has an overarching importance that goes beyond the field. It’s the brotherhood and unity within the NFL that will be in full effect tomorrow as we all welcome Eric Berry back.</p>\n<p>Berry’s recovery continues as he works himself back into the first-team All-Pro, three-time Pro Bowler that we know him to be. While it may take a while to return to that elite level, expect Berry to prove any limitation upon him wrong.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

four-year, $87.6 million ($60 million guaranteed) contract extension with the Seattle Seahawks is an offseason move that we eventually expected and are all glad to see be completed.</p>\n<p>There was much curiosity as to whether or not Seattle and Wilson would come to an agreement before the start of training camp. Despite Wilson’s new contract not ending with him being the highest-paid quarterback in the NFL, it’s a much more comforting difference from the $1.5 million salary he was set to make heading into the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>Wilson is now the second highest-paid quarterback in the NFL behind the Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers with an average salary per year of $17.82 million. Also, his $60 million in guaranteed money is tied for third-most in the NFL among current quarterback contracts behind Pittsburg’s Ben Roethlisberger and San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While on paper Wilson is set to make more than half the amount of money his contract entitles, that guaranteed money doesn’t fully become his just yet.</p>\n<p>Of the $60 million Wilson plans on making in guaranteed money, only the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/russell-wilson-contract-guarantees-2015-8\">first year of his four-year contract</a>–$31.7 million, is fully guaranteed. The total of $31. 7 million stems from a $31 million signing bonus and $700 thousand base salary.</p>\n<p>With the rest of Wilson’s contract depending on his future as the Seahawk’s quarterback, it’s assumed that he will definitely remain in Seattle and collect the money he is owed.</p>\n<p>As Seattle tries to retain as many of its primary impact players that have helped the Seahawks get to two consecutive Super Bowls, not giving Wilson the top notch contract he wanted is just fine.</p>\n<p>With the Seahawks salary cap already spent on keeping players such as Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, Marshawn Lynch, and recently Bobby Wagner, now the NFL’s highest-paid middle linebacker after signing a four-year extension worth $43 million ($22 million guaranteed), <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/08/03/seahawks-cant-pay-many-any-more-guys/\">Seattle can only spend so much on players it plans on keeping for the future.</a></p>\n<p>While Seattle may have thought it was done handing out contract extensions, star safety Kam Chancellor is currently holding out from training camp in search of more money. After signing a contract extension with the Seahawks in 2013 worth $35 million for five-years, Chancellor is scheduled to make a base salary of $4.55 million this season.</p>\n<p>In the midst of negotiating player contracts, Seattle has begun its process of releasing players in order to increase salary cap space. Surprisingly, starting defensive tackle Tony McDaniel was released and it’s expected that the Seahawks will probably cut more players and search for cheaper talent. Although McDaniel has been a pivotal piece of Seattle’s defensive front, it’s amazing to see how the business of professional sports outweighs performance sometimes.</p>\n<p>Situations such as Chancellor’s and various others that have decided to hold out are examples of why players have voiced their opinions in the past. In regard to contracts, with the NFL being one of the nation’s top sports industries, players believe that they deserve the guaranteed money and leverage when negotiating that NBA and MLB players have.</p>\n<p>For instance, back in May Minnesota Vikings’ running back Adrian Peterson stated his <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/adrian-peterson-twitter-4\">frustration of franchises having control over player contracts. </a></p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how things pan out between Chancellor and the Seahawks. At the end of the day, Seattle’s effort and success to maintain key pieces must be applauded. However, is it too concerned with keeping its best players and ignoring the possibility of underpaying its role players?</p>\n<p>No one knows what Seattle’s next decision concerning its roster</p>\n<p>will be, but knowing that Wilson will be a Seahawk for years to come is the team’s biggest win so far this offseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Currently, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is the next candidate in line for a major payday. While some may disagree, Wilson seems to be the ideal frontrunner for young quarterbacks on the brink of sealing the coveted “elite” label.</p>\n<p>Constant speculation of the contract negotiations between Wilson and the Seahawks have generated the possibility of him becoming the highest-paid player in the NFL. Despite being drafted as the 75<sup>th</sup> pick in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft in which five different quarterbacks were drafted before him, Wilson has proved that he belongs and can survive in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Of that 2012 draft class, Wilson, Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Ryan Tannehill are the only names of quarterbacks that are still prevalent within NFL storylines. While Luck was the No. 1 overall draft pick and first quarterback off the board, Wilson has had the most success out of the 2012 draftees.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Entering the final year of his rookie contract with a set salary of $1.5 million, the Seahawks’ field general is well deserving of a multi-year contract that could make him the NFL’s richest man. With quarterbacks like Cam Newton, Tannehill, RG3 earning contract extensions, and Luck with plans of receiving a surplus of money, the legendary slogan of “numbers never lie” is the one thing that separates Wilson from the rest.</p>\n<p>Since entering the league in 2012, Wilson’s 36 regular-season wins are the most by any quarterback in his first three seasons, he has an NFL-high 15 fourth quarter/comeback victories, and helped lead Seattle to its first Super Bowl win in franchise history out of two consecutive championship trips.</p>\n<p>Despite the controversial play call that resulted with a game-winning interception by Malcolm Butler to secure the Patriots’ Super Bowl victory, it is inevitable that Wilson has completely transformed the Seahawks from being a below average team into a consistent postseason contender. Prior to Wilson’s arrival, Seattle had not won a playoff game since its upset victory versus the New Orleans Saints in 2010.</p>\n<p>Besides proving himself as a quarterback capable of competing and winning at the NFL level, Wilson’s dual-threat skillset is another viable attribute that must be valued during contract negotiations.</p>\n<p>His combination of being an efficient pocket passer and his playmaking abilities when on the run are what have allowed him to become one of the NFL’s current best quarterbacks. While injuries have plagued the former 2012 Offensive Rookie of the Year in RG3 and Newton possessing these same dual-threat talents, Wilson has perfected the balance between passing and rushing the ball. While the numbers may not show significant changes, Wilson has gradually improved each season in both statistical categories.</p>\n<p>However, while Wilson’s performance has been the primary drive behind the Seahawks’ resurgence, the supporting cast of having the NFL’s best defense and arguably best running back in Marshawn Lynch are factors that lead to Seattle’s caution when negotiating the quarterback’s long-term contract.</p>\n<p>Whenever Wilson has been unable to produce for Seattle offensively, it has been the Seahawks defense that has carried the load. Primarily led by original “Legion of Boom” members such as Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas III, the Seahawks defense has consistently ranked amongst the top in points, passing, rushing, and total yards allowed.</p>\n<p>Commonly known for his “Beastmode” moniker, Lynch’s downhill, gritty running style has definitely made Wilson’s quarterbacking job a lot easier. Despite a slow start to his first year as a Seahawk in 2010, Lynch has rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of his last four seasons.  He tied for an NFL-high 13 rushing touchdowns and finished fifth in total rushing yards with 1,306 this past season.</p>\n<p>The fact that Wilson has yet to throw 30-plus touchdown passes or break the 4,000 yard mark for passing in his career may be alarming for some, but it doesn’t mean the man doesn’t deserve his money. With the addition of tight-end Jimmy Graham, Wilson has another weapon in his arsenal that can help elevate his stature on the field.</p>\n<p>While some may not even consider him to be a top-five NFL quarterback, Wilson has undoubtedly helped turn Seattle into a winning organization. At the end of the day, the Seahawks must realize how valuable of a steal Wilson has been since his arrival in Seattle and can show their appreciation for him with a new contract this offseason.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64347\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64347\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/","id":3280,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3279,3278,3277],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":10,"highestPage":12,"route":"/authors/45"}},"__N_SSG":true}
