With a current 2-0 Big West record, the Highlanders have now won 18 consecutive conference games.</p>\n<p>Allowing a combined 175 points in its two losses to the Highlanders last season, UCSB is committed to improving on the defensive end in attempt to contain the orderly ball movement and quickness of UCR’s potent offense.</p>\n<p>With the nearly uncontainable Brittany Crain, former two-time Big West Player of the Year and star player who put up a combined 56 points in two wins over UCSB last year  no longer in a Highlanders’ uniform, the Gauchos have one less worry to conquer in facing UCR’s arsenal of scorers.</p>\n<p>Following last season’s finish as one of the conference’s top defenses, UCSB has remained consistent defending the ball. The Gauchos are the third best scoring defense in the Big West, allowing just 64.0 point per game.</p>\n<p>Saturday has the potential to be a defensive battle as the Highlanders sit atop the conference in points allowed per contest, allowing 63.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Since the start of Big West play, UC Riverside has matched its stoutness on defense with improvements on offense as well. In two conference games, UCR is tied in scoring with an average of 72.0 points per game.</p>\n<p>A team that boasts three double figure scorers, at the forefront of the Highlanders’ offense is the versatile talent of senior forward Réjane Vérin.</p>\n<p>UCR’s power in the paint, Vérin leads the Big West in both scoring and assists per game at averages of 17.1 and 4.5, respectively. She is also known for her hustle on the boards as her 8.1 rebounds per game places her second in the league.</p>\n<p>Vérin has flat out been the best player in Big West play thus far, averaging a conference leading 23.0 points and 10.5 rebounds per game, respectively. Leading UCR’s frontcourt, she has tallied four double-doubles in addition to scoring 20-plus points in six games this season.</p>\n<p>Aiding Vérin is the backcourt duo of senior guard Simone DeCoud and junior guard Lauren Holt. With higher expectations placed upon them entering this season, both have emerged to help carry the offensive load for UC Riverside, averaging 12.5 and 12.4 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>Most notably, both have been impressive on the defensive end of the court as well after playing in two conference games. Since the beginning of Big West play, DeCoud and Holt each average 2.0 steals per game, tying for fourth most in the conference.</p>\n<p>In preparing to face a team that can be productive on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball, UCSB must remain committed to its pace of offense and not allow UCR’s fast paced strategy to dismantle its possessions as the Highlanders possess a conference leading 6.1 steals per game.</p>\n<p>Known for operating its offense around its shooters, UCSB plays at its highest level when it can knock down the three.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ last four games they have made at least six three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Typically known for her driving ability, senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe has been efficient from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>She currently leads the Big West in three-point percentage with a 45.9 average and is coming off a 3-for-3 performance from beyond the arc in UCSB victory over Cal State Fullerton last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Also within the Gauchos’ split of games during their pair of conference openers was the outstanding three-point shooting of sophomore guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in scoring with 11.3 points per game, Miller made a career-high seven shots from behind the perimeter to end the game with 23 points in UCSB’s loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Helping spark the Gauchos’ three-point shooting has been the assisting of both Jemerigbe and redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. Since the start of Big West play, Jemerigbe is tied for the conference lead with Vérin at 5.5 assists per game. Off by just .5 of a mark is Toler at 5.0 helpers per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Riverside will tip-off this Saturday, Jan. 14  at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/","id":292,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[291,290,289],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2016-17 Big West Women’s Basketball Conference Preview","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?resize=683%2C333&ssl=1","description":"Big West play is now officially upon us, and with that, the Daily Nexus Sports staff releases their annual Big West preview.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74778\" style=\"width: 457px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74778\" data-attachment-id=\"74778\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/big-west-wbb-16-17/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?fit=683%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"683,333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"big-west-wbb-16-17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?fit=250%2C122&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?fit=683%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74778\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?resize=447%2C218\" alt=\"Kevin Son / Daily Nexus\" width=\"447\" height=\"218\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Big-West-WBB-16-17.jpg?resize=250%2C122&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74778\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Son / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A new year means a fresh start for everyone.

With championship bragging rights and a NCAA invitation bid on the line, these nine Big West foes will be battling all season in order to prove they are the better team, at least for this year. Whether UC Riverside will repeat as champs, or another squad will dethrone them, one thing is for sure, these conference match-ups will be some of the most intense basketball these teams have faced all season.

Winners in four of its last six games, UCSB managed to gain some momentum after going on a three-game winning streak but was unable to sustain its momentum heading into conference play with a 64-60 loss in its final nonconference game to Yale.</p>\n<p>Projected to finish seventh in the Big West Preseason Media Poll, the Gauchos are better geared for the conference schedule after an improved nonconference finish in year two with Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. Santa Barbara improved by one win after a 4-12 nonconference finish during its 2015-16 campaign.</p>\n<p>Set to begin a three-game home stand versus UC Riverside this Saturday, UCSB’s home stay at the Thunderdome is a pivotal opportunity for the Gauchos to move up in the conference rankings.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Gauchos allow an average of 60.2 points per game when playing at home. UCSB has crafted one of the toughest defenses in the Big West as it ranks second in points allowed per game (64.0) and third in opponent three-point percentage (28.8).</p>\n<p>Although UCSB hasn’t found much consistency offensively, ranking third last in scoring with a PPG average of 60.1, the emergence of sophomore guard Coco Miller has been significant in the team’s performance.</p>\n<p>Miller leads the Gauchos in scoring at 11.3 PPG. She has already tied her previous season-high mark of two 20-plus point games after recording a career-high 24 points versus Pepperdine and 23 points on the road at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The addition of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman has provided the Gauchos with a post presence, a feature that had been missing on both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s 53.4 field goal percentage ranks third in the Big West. She has tallied three double-doubles thus far and recorded a career-high 20 points in the Gauchos’ victory over NAU earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Riverside this Saturday, Jan. 14 at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Ryan Burns </strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Long Beach women’s basketball team has enjoyed an impressive start to their season at 10-6 overall, 1-0 Big West, including a pair of wins over LMU and Nevada, proving themselves as an early contender for the Big West Crown. The Niners have also been tested against the nation’s very top teams including Duke and Florida, gaining valuable experience on the biggest stage.</p>\n<p>The team is led by senior forward Madison Montgomery who leads the team with 11.4 ppg on .456 shooting percentage, also a team high. The forward has shown marked improvement since last season when she finished the year with 8.6 points a game on .376 shooting. Behind Montgomery stand senior guard Raven Benton (10.2 ppg) and senior guard/forward Jewelyn Sawyer, the team’s leading rebounder with 6.9 boards per game.</p>\n<p>The trio of seniors link up to form a strong core of a team with high ambitions, hoping to leave with titles to show for their 49ers careers following last year’s 24-9 finish (12-4 BWC). Coming off a loss to Hawaii in the conference tournament and Oregon in the WNIT, leaving them with a bit of revenge to seek as Big West play tips off.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>No doubt, one of the biggest threats in the Big West women’s conference this season is the UC Davis squad, which was expected to finish in second place behind LBSU in the Big West standings at season’s end.</p>\n<p>The Aggies have put together a solid year thus far, boasting an 11-4 overall record and a 2-0 start in conference play after blowout wins against UC Irvine and Hawaii. They are also currently winners of five of their last six games.</p>\n<p>Although UC Davis only has five upperclassmen on the roster, the team is not short on talent. One example of this is redshirt sophomore Morgan Bertsch, who is following up an excellent rookie campaign with an even better second year as she is leading the Big West in points per game with 17.5. She also leads her squad in rebounding with 5.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>This year, the Aggies have been great on the offensive end as a team outscoring their opponents by over 100 points at 1097-969. They currently lead the Big West in points per game with 73.1 and currently hold the best assists per game as well at 17.1.</p>\n<p>UC Davis will face off against Long Beach State in what could be the game that decides the Big West winner on Thursday, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Andrew Hernandez</strong></p>\n<p>Coming off of a disappointing early playoff exit in the 2016 Big West Conference tournament, the UC Riverside Highlanders look to repeat as Big West Conference regular season champions despite losing two-time Big West Player of the Year Brittany Crain.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders won their home Big West opener and are currently 1-0 in conference play, looking to leave behind a 7-7 record in nonconference play. The Highlanders’ win increased their regular season game winning streak — which dates back to last season — to 17.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have been depending on seniors Réjane Vérin and Simone DeCoud, who were on the 2016 Big West Conference First and Second Teams, respectively, to lead their offense.</p>\n<p>“Vérin and DeCoud are the engines that drives our team’s success,” Head Coach John Margaritis said. “We need them to produce with consistency for us to be successful and to allow our role players to fill in and contribute.”</p>\n<p>Vèrin, the team’s starting forward, scored 21 points, hauled in 10 rebounds and had seven assists in the Highlanders’ last game. The talented senior is currently leading the team in the blocks, points, assists and rebounds per game categories. Senior guard DeCoud is right behind Vérin as she is second in those same categories.</p>\n<p>UCR continues its road to Big West dominance when it faces Cal Poly in its second conference game of the season tonight at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>Capturing its seventh NCAA Tournament bid and first Big West Championship title since 1996 last season, the University of Hawaii has big shoes to fill following the departure of its five seniors and a 21-11 finish.</p>\n<p>Projected to land in the middle of the pack, selected to finish in fifth place in the preseason coaches’ poll, Head Coach Laura Beeman is mindful of the time it takes young teams like hers to develop and replicate a winning culture.</p>\n<p>“We’ve put last year behind us,” Beeman said. “We’re a totally different team now with new players looking to establish their own identity. We want to formulate our own traditions and use that as a springboard for this season and the next.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine sit at 4-10 on the year and 0-2 in conference play following a 68-57 loss to league favorite Long Beach State last Thursday.</p>\n<p>With a team that featured three All-Big West selections last year including Big West All-Tournament MVP Ashleigh Karaitiana, the pressure is on for upperclassmen junior guard Sarah Toeaina and senior point guard Briana Harris. Toeaina has emerged as an offensive catalyst for the Rainbow Wahine averaging 11.8 ppg. Hawaii will face Fullerton this Thursday at 7 p.m. HT.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>Since winning back-to-back Big West tournament titles in 2014 and 2015, Cal State Northridge’s reign at the top of the conference has gradually diminished. The loss of talent after winning its pair of conference titles is what influenced CSUN’s downward spiral last season.</p>\n<p>After a fairly dreadful 2015-16 season in which the Matadors finished 7-24 and 5-11 in conference play, this season has certainly been an improvement for a young team featuring only one senior.</p>\n<p>Sitting at 8-8, 1-1 in the Big West, the Matadors are up showing many naysayers by being at the .500 mark. Despite not being consistent enough to achieve a winning streak beyond two games, Northridge has still played strong following its losses. Only twice this season has the team lost consecutive games.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the Mustangs’ Big West slate saw them handle Cal State Fullerton 58-41, before falling to Cal Poly 79-68. Sophomore center Channon Fluker has paced her team in points, scoring 15.3 per game on 49.3 percent shooting in just over 24 minutes per contest. She also averages a double-double, raking in a conference leading 11.1 rebounds a game, which also ranks as the most on her team by a sizable margin.</p>\n<p>Fluker’s post game is accompanied by redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe’s perimeter shooting ability, as her 39 three-pointers made leads for the team and contributed to her average of 11.5 points per contest.Maulupe is the team’s second-highest scorer and only other Matador scoring in double figures besides Fluker.</p>\n<p>Maulupe is the team’s second-highest scorer and only other Matador scoring in double figures besides Fluker.</p>\n<p>Despite several impressive performances on the year, including losing to Michigan State (12-4) by only four points, two-time Big West Coach of the Year Jason Flowers, and the Matadors seem to have a viable chance to return to their winning ways in 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly women’s basketball may not have begun their 2016-2017 season the way they wanted to, but they are now currently tied with UC Davis for first place in the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>After Saturday’s 79-68 win over the visiting CSUN Matadors, Cal Poly is off to an impressive 2-0 start in Conference play. This turnaround mentality is exactly what the Mustangs were looking for as they exited the preseason at a meager 4-8.</p>\n<p>“Our pre-season had quite a few challenges. I would have hoped that we would have learned at a quicker pace considering that we had so many returners,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “The good news is that we have been learning and improving.”</p>\n<p>The improvements are evident as three different players have found themselves in the top 5 of the Big West’s Individual Offense Leaders category.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Dynn Leaupepe places fifth overall points per game for the Big West (14.9), just as her sister, junior guard Lynn Leaupepe, is second overall in Rebounds per Game (8.1). Coach Mimnaugh is impressed with the initiative these twins convey and how their talent complements the skills of fellow teammates.</p>\n<p>The third offensive leader is senior forward Hannah Gilbert, who is also praised for her defensive ability. Coach Mimnaugh also believes that Gilbert’s performance so far should warrant her consideration for Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Mustangs current showing promotes the notion that the team is headed in the right direction whilst being led by a splendid coaching staff.</p>\n<p>“We have an unselfish, hard-working group who have bought into the roles they play … a great sign for continuing to strengthen chemistry and teamwork,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>This week, Cal Poly will look to extend their undefeated streak on Thursday, Jan. 12, on the road against UC Riverside at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>It was only three years ago that the UC Irvine women’s basketball team picked to finish eighth in the Big West preseason poll, surprised everyone by going 9-7 in conference play and managing to pick up a postseason victory in an overtime game against UC Davis in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Picked again to finish eighth this year, that recent history suggests it would be foolish to assume that the Anteaters will meekly fall into their predicted position.</p>\n<p>Early returns indicate that if UC Irvine does indeed defy this year’s preseason predictions, it might be in the opposite direction of what they did in 2013-14. The Anteaters entered conference play sporting a conference-worst 2-12 record and two ugly losses to UC Davis by a score of 89-48 and UC Riverside 76-58 haven’t helped matters.</p>\n<p>If Irvine stands a chance of turning things around and emulating that 2013-14 season, it will be on the strength of senior Shereen Sutherland, junior Sabrina Engelstad and sophomore Andee Ritter who are all averaging double digits in points per game.</p>\n<p>Sutherland, a 6’2” forward, is averaging a team-high 6.9 rebounds per game, while Engelstad leads the squad in blocks. Rounding out the trio, Ritter has come up with a team-leading 2.3 steals per game.</p>\n<p>These three players will be the key to a massive turnaround for first-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue’s team. The Anteaters have not helped themselves much so far this year, but UC Irvine of all teams should know that it’s still possible to defy expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – Quinn Moslander</strong></p>\n<p>After a tough 2015-16 season, the Cal State Fullerton women’s basketball team has entered conference play with a two-game losing streak but looks to improve as the season progresses. So far, they sit at a 3-12 record, similar to their overall record of 3-27 last year.</p>\n<p>Despite recent losses, the team has increased their average points scored per game from 55.8 to 60.7 and improved their field goal percentage from 35.5 to 37.9 since last year.</p>\n<p>The Titans’ top scorers — senior guard Iman Lathan, junior center Daeja Smith, and senior guard Jordan Jackson — lead their team despite having not played last season. Grabbing a combined score of 38 points in their most recent conference game against the Gauchos, they also have the most playing time alongside sophomore guard Jade Vega and senior guard China Henderson.</p>\n<p>With only three wins under their belt this season, the Cal State Fullerton Titans have room to improve their record and play on the court. Their next game will be at the University of Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 12.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74737\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74737\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/","id":293,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[292,291,290],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Non-Conf.

Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi comes in at 4-5 as it is on a current two game slump. Able to recently overcome a nine game losing streak is North Dakota State as it sits at 2-9.</p>\n<p>Providing the most consistency has been the Gauchos’ backcourt duo of senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>Although not widely known for their scoring abilities, with Jemerigbe and Toler averaging 8.4 and 6.9 points per game, respectively, the two have efficiently distributed the ball to create scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe’s total of 39 assists is tied for first in the Big West, while Toler’s 35 dimes ranks fourth in the conference. Both also rank in the top 10 of the conference in assists per game with Jemerigbe in second with an average of 3.9 and Toler in fifth at a 3.5 average.</p>\n<p>Most recently, it was Toler that emerged to get UCSB over its losing woes with the game-winning jumpshot in the team’s victory over Fresno State on Friday. She has been a pivotal asset in the Gauchos’ bench rotation as her PPG average leads all second unit players.</p>\n<p>Coming off its season-high three-point percentage of 50 percent in its win, it is likely UCSB will attempt to maintain its hot hand from long distance. On average, the Gauchos make 7.1 three-pointers per game and are just two three-pointers short of being tied with UC Davis for second place in total three-pointers made this season with a current mark of 71.</p>\n<p>Leading Santa Barbara’s three-point attack is redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter. She possesses a team-high total of 25 made three-pointers and is third in the conference in three-point percentage at 43.1 percent.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB has successfully defended the perimeter as well. The Gauchos lead the Big West in opponent three-point percentage, holding teams to a 25.9 average.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos may meet their match Monday afternoon facing Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi as the Islanders’ defense is one of the best of their conference.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi ranks third in the Southland Conference in scoring defense, allowing 61.1 PPG. Most notably, the Islanders hold a conference-leading 29.6 opponent three-point percentage. They rank second in opponent field goal percentage too, restricting past teams to a 37.9 average.</p>\n<p>A pair of wins could send Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi into Southland Conference play with a winning record for just the third time in program history.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos will face more of a defensive battle in playing the Islanders, they will hope to contain North Dakota State’s junior guard Taylor Thunstedt.</p>\n<p>Thunstedt leads the Bison in scoring with 16 PPG which ranks third in the Summit League. She also leads the league in total made three-pointers with 42 and is fourth in points scored with 176 this season.</p>\n<p>Another concern for UCSB will be dealing with the size of senior forward Emily Spier. She’s behind Thunstedt in scoring with an average of 10. 3 points per game, but is the team’s leading rebounder, collecting eight per game, ranking third in the Summit League.</p>\n<p>Adding to the Bison’s presence on the boards is senior forward Brianna Jones.

Santa Clara dominated the Gauchos in both games, defeating UCSB by an average of 14.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Four of five starters returned for Santa Clara this season as the familiarity has been helpful with three Broncos currently averaged double-figures in scoring with roughly 12 PPG.</p>\n<p>Within this group of three are two of the team’s returning starters in senior forward Marie Bertholdt and junior forward Morgan McGwire. It was McGwire, who led the Broncos in each matchup, scoring with 13 points apiece.</p>\n<p>After redshirting last season, completing the trio of scorers, the newest addition to the lineup   is redshirt sophomore guard Emily Wolph. She is the Broncos’ markswoman from long range as she makes and attempts the most three-pointers per game on the team at 2.2 makes and 5.6 attempts, respectively. She is second on the team behind McGwire in three-point percentage at 39.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Still, the Broncos’ size is what poses the most difficult challenge for UCSB’s defense.</p>\n<p>In the first game, the Broncos managed to outrebound UCSB 45-31 in addition to outscoring them in points in the paint 28-14 and second chance points 24-7. Following this game just two weeks later, Santa Clara continued its dominance shooting 45. 1 percent from the field while outscoring UCSB in the paint 32-18.</p>\n<p>Given the Broncos’ ability to control the interior, it is obvious that the Gauchos will look to have a stern defensive presence in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to handle their size,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We’re still small on the perimeter. I thought their size bothered us last year not just inside, [but also] on the perimeter [just as much]. If we’re not going to be as big, we have to be able to play fast.”</p>\n<p>While playing with at a fast pace may be most beneficial for UCSB, the Gauchos will hope to sustain their momentum from last game after tallying season-highs in field goal percentage at 46.2 percent from the field and 41.2 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s cold shooting in last season’s two games did not help their attempt to contain the Broncos’ size as UCSB shot below 30 percent from the field and beyond the three-point line in each game.</p>\n<p>Giving the Gauchos a better chance to compete against the Broncos’ inside presence is redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman. She enters Wednesday’s game leading the Big West in field goal percentage shooting 62.8 percent from the field and is one of two Gauchos, alongside sophomore guard Coco Miller, to average double-digit PPG at 12.2.</p>\n<p>At the brink of becoming another Gaucho to average double-figures in scoring is redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter. She averages 9.4 PPG and is third in the conference in total three-pointers made with 11. Porter’s 42.3 three-point average also ranks eighth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Put in the team’s starting lineup two games ago, Porter is still adjusting to her role after beginning the season on the bench as she emerges as one of the Gauchos’ top scorers.</p>\n<p>Yet, in order for UCSB to establish consistency on the offensive end, it must be efficient with possession of the ball. In its last matchup against the Broncos, UCSB had a season-high 31 turnovers.</p>\n<p>Despite being able to force Santa Clara to turn the ball over in the two games with 29 and 24 turnovers, respectively, UCSB was still outscored by the Broncos in points off turnovers each time.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to get to a [point in which] we take more pride in our half court defense,” Henrickson said. “We have to be more disruptive. Even the little [guards] can be disruptive. We have to be able to get out and play fast in transition, try to take advantage of our speed. But to do that you’ve got to be able to get a stop.”</p>\n<p>With Edelman in the paint, it is plausible that the Gauchos’ ability to disrupt the Broncos increases as UCSB’s frontcourt has the ability to compete on the boards, which will help put the team’s up-tempo plan in motion.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s matchup between UCSB and Santa Clara will tip-off at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74522\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74522\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/gauchos-return-home-to-face-santa-clara/","id":315,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[314,313,312],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Edelman’s Career-High 20 Points Leads UCSB to Home Victory Over NAU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Home games have worked in favor of the UCSB women's basketball team as the Gauchos' two season wins have been earned at the Thunderdome.

If you want to play, you have to come out hard,” Farris said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the score, NAU managed to overcome its four-point deficit with an 11-0 scoring run in the closing minutes of the first quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving life to NAU’s offense was senior guard Brittani Lusain. The senior guard led Northern Arizona in scoring, rebounds and assists with 17 points, nine rebounds and three dimes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NAU earned its largest lead of five points, up 16-11 as a result of a three-point make by redshirt junior forward Kenna McDavis. The Boise State transfer was responsible for two of the Lumberjacks’ total of four three-point makes, sinking 2-3 from deep to end the first half with 10 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to UCSB, Northern Arizona experienced stagnancy on offense as McDavis’ basket would be NAU’s last field goal of the first quarter and the drought continued into the second. NAU went scoreless from the 2:04 mark in the first until McDavis scored its first points at the free-throw line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams continued to trade baskets, leading to a 25-25 tie at halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NAU’s last lead of the game, 33-31, was formed by senior guard Rene Coggins taking a wide open right lane to score the go-ahead layup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite going 1-11 from behind the three-point line, coming out of an NAU timeout, the Gauchos gained a spark in the closing minutes of the third quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s penetration of the paint helped provide spacing on the perimeter as an assist from inside by Edelman to Porter for the three-pointer was made. NAU would go on to knot the score at 36-36 in responding with a long distance make by senior guard Taylor Leyva, who has six points and three rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing UCSB with a comfortable lead was a quick 7-1 run to close out the third. The Gauchos gained a 43-37 lead after sophomore guard Coco Miller’s only three-point make of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the fourth quarter, NAU pulled within a one-point deficit a total of four times, but was unable to regain the lead over UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping fend off the Lumberjacks, who trailed 47-46, was senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe in recording her first field goal of the game with 4:42 remaining in the game. She achieved a career-high in free-throw makes and attempts, missing just one as she went 9-10 at the line to register 11 points. Jemerigbe and Miller tied for the game-high in assists with five. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite five fouls limiting her to just 25 minutes, the redshirt sophomore made her first start of the season.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scoring each of her field goals from beyond the arc, going 3-5, Porter knocked down a clutch three-pointer to push the Gauchos’ lead to 56-50.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter’s three-pointer was UCSB’s last field goal of the game as the Gauchos secured their victory at the free-throw line. Adding further security to the win was a steal by Miller on an inbound attempt by NAU, leading to Jemerigbe being fouled and ending the game with free-throws. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will be back on the road on Friday, Nov. 25 at the University of San Diego. It will face the Toreros at 5 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

night in which LeBron James sat out the second game of a back-to-back trip, the Cleveland Cavaliers remain the best team in the NBA thus far.</p>\n<p>The mission to “Defend the Land” has been placed in full drive with the Cavs, who once again look like the clear favorite to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals come June.</p>\n<p>The journey to repeat as NBA champions is no guarantee, but through 11 games — 10 of which have been against Eastern Conference opponents — the Cavs are 9-2. Most notably, they have defeated two of the East’s projected top contenders: the Toronto Raptors (twice this season) and the Boston Celtics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to its first defeat, the Cavs’ 6-0 start stands as the best team start in LeBron James’s career, having reached the 5-1 mark a total of three times in two consecutive seasons with Miami in 2012 and 2013 in addition to last season with the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>\n<p>The end result of each season that started 5-1? Three NBA championship titles.</p>\n<p>It was the second-best start in franchise history, falling short of the 1976-77 Cavaliers’ 8-0 start.</p>\n<p>Although records don’t tell all about a team, Cleveland’s current squad could be the best team that has ever surrounded James, who is currently in his 10th season with the franchise since returning in 2014.</p>\n<p>Despite still being in his prime, at 31 years old James faces the reality of father time creeping up, considering the retirements of basketball legends Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett this past season and offseason.</p>\n<p>Although the King’s dethronement isn’t expected anytime soon, having recently surpassed NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon for 10th place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, the Cavaliers’ hometown superstar has about four to six years remaining in his career.</p>\n<p>It is a time span that reinforces the same message since his return to Cleveland: Win now.</p>\n<p>No one can predict what the Cavaliers will become post-LeBron, especially after the additions made in recent years, but it is likely the team will lose its value as a top contender. The immediate decline in wins from 2010-2014, occurring during James’s stint with the Heat, was more than enough evidence that it must build around their star player.</p>\n<p>The first step toward rebuilding during those four seasons was the selection of Kyrie Irving with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>Entering the NBA with a foot injury and offset by other nagging injuries throughout his career, the most significant being his fractured kneecap in game one of the 2015 NBA Finals, Irving slightly became a forgotten cause as a player with the potential to be one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>Despite Irving earning the 2011-12 Rookie of the Year award and being known for his ability to score, a lack of acknowledgment for his game still remained.</p>\n<p>After LeBron James signed a five-year, $90 million contract extension during the 2014 offseason, his unexpected return that same year has worked in the favor of Irving ever since.</p>\n<p>Playing in just 53 games last season after recovering from the previous year’s knee injury, Irving has excelled, proving his ability to take over on the game’s biggest stage in the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Convincing many that he outplayed the two-time NBA MVP Steph Curry in the series, averaging 27.1 points per game and scoring the game-winning three-point dagger in his face to secure Cleveland’s first-ever title, Irving used the postseason to remind and prove to the world he is one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>It was obvious then, and it is obvious now that without Irving the Cavaliers cannot win an NBA championship.</p>\n<p>Whenever it seems like the Cavs are down and out on the brink of defeat, it is Irving who has stepped up as the team’s savior when even James wouldn’t be expected to prevail.</p>\n<p>Although other players such as J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert, Channing Frye, Kevin Love and more play pivotal roles in the Cavs’ success as well, the tandem of Irving and James has formulated a one-two punch that is capable of carrying Cleveland to future title victories.</p>\n<p>The pairing of the two has helped reduce the pressures on James and provides Cleveland with an option to stay within winning games as the team’s leader rests.<br>\nFor purposes of rest, James intentionally sat out for the first time this season in the Cavs’ game against the Pacers.</p>\n<p>In addition to scoring the ball well, ranking third in the league in scoring at 109 PPG, Cleveland has remained consistent on defense, allowing 103.5 PPG. Despite the average, the Cavs have allowed 100-plus points in just six of their 11 games this season.</p>\n<p>Although the Golden State Warriors, considered Cleveland’s rival as we anticipate a third-consecutive Finals meeting between the two, are a team capable of going back and forth in a shootout with any team, their occasional lapses on defense detract from their league-leading 117.3 PPG average.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Warriors are tied for allowing the seventh highest opponent PPG average at 109.3. In comparison to Cleveland’s six games, Golden State has allowed 100-plus points in nine of its 11 games.</p>\n<p>It is true the Warriors are still adjusting to their addition of former NBA MVP Kevin Durant and the departures of primary role players Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut, but Golden State must find a way to resolve its inconsistencies, which mainly fall on it becoming smaller around the key and paint areas.</p>\n<p>One can only hope another Cavs-Warriors championship matchup will take place. After leading in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks in the NBA Finals, if James and co. were able to defeat the self-embraced “Super Villains” of Golden State, he would achieve the ultimate victory that would earn him a nod in surpassing two of the game’s greatest in Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Much is still to occur throughout this season. There will be phases during which Cleveland will look like the best team or falter to its high expectations, preventing the prediction of the Cavs winning it all in 2016-17.</p>\n<p>It’s a game-by-game process in which teams continue to develop, even in the case of the Cleveland Cavaliers heading into year three of James being back at the helm. Their “All In” mentality is a motto that persists in the championship-or-bust expectations that have become standard for fans such as ourselves to judge accordingly.</p>\n<p>All stats are accurate as of Nov. 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74298\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74298\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/","id":3338,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3337,3336,3335],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Earns First Victory in Home Opener Behind Miller’s 24 Points","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite having a lower field goal percentage than its opponent in Pepperdine, the UCSB women's basketball team managed to earn its first win of the season with its three-point shooting and attack in t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a rewarding ending at the Thunderdome for the UCSB women’s basketball team Tuesday night as it defeated Pepperdine 66-57 in its home opener.

Nearly all of her field goals in the game were from three-point distance except one jumpshot as she ended the game 6-15 from the field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman emerged big in the second half. After no shot attempts in the first half due to two fouls limiting her to play for just four minutes, Edelman recorded all 12 of her field goal attempts in the game’s last 20 minutes. Her domination of the paint led to her finishing with 16 points on 8-12 shooting to go with five rebounds and one block. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was definitely exciting to not be in foul trouble anymore,” Edelman said. “My teammates are great about throwing me the ball. When they kick it in and I’m getting double teamed, I can kick it out and I know that Coco will knock down an open shot. It’s definitely a good thing we have going.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan to penetrate the paint to open up shots on the perimeter worked out the gates as Miller drained a three to give UCSB its first points of the games. The deep make ignite the Gauchos’ 5-0 run to start the first quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the 7:01 mark of the period, Pepperdine had earned its first lead, responding with a 9-0 run of its own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading the Waves’ scoring charge were their guard tandem of redshirt freshman Sydney Bordonaro and senior Allie Green. Hitting her first three-pointer of the game during the run, Bordonaro scored five points to contribute to her team-high total of 15 points on 6-12 overall and 3-5 shooting from beyond the arc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green scored the other four during the scoring stretch, ending the game with 12 points on 4-11 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB gained its first double-figure lead of 21-11 during its 10-0 run that carried over from the end of the first to the second period. It earned its largest lead of 14 points at 27-13 as a result of a made layup by redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB pressured the Waves’ offense into turning the ball over a total of 22 times, but was inefficient in capitalizing on its opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite shooting 6-16  from three-point range in the first two quarters, the Gauchos struggled inside the three-point line and had issues converting on their forced turnovers, going 3-18 on layups in the first half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you miss a wide open layup, you’re focused on the wrong thing,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “You’re wide open, you’ve got to finish. We missed nine [wide open layups]. We just absolutely didn’t reward our defense for opportunities in transition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inconsistencies in transition ultimately led to Santa Barbara’s being held scoreless in the remaining 5:47 of the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pepperdine embarked on a 9-0 run to end the first half, trimming the Gauchos’ lead to 27-22 at halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first tie of the game occurred at the 7:42 mark of the third quarter as Pepperdine’s Green had an open left lane to the basket, knotting the game at 29-29. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping improve the Gauchos’ 24.3 field goal percentage was their improvements in shot selection in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing a balance to UCSB’s three-point attack was its emphasis on getting the ball to the paint in the second half. It attempted just eight three-point attempts, finishing the game 8-24 from downtown, and displayed its commitment to Edelman early. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan to feed Edelman in the paint was beneficial as she ended the third quarter with 10 points on 4-7 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A three-pointer by Porter just 30 seconds into the fourth quarter regained a double-figure lead for UCSB, building its lead to 45-34.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scoring eight of her 12 total points in the fourth quarter of the game was Pepperdine’s sophomore forward Yasmine Robinson-Bacote. Able to convert on an and-1 opportunity Robinson-Bacote after a successful drive to the hoop, bringing the Waves’ deficit to 51-44.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A steal followed by a go-ahead layup by sophomore guard Paige Fecske allowed the Waves to stay in contention, trailing 58-51, as they called a timeout after the field goal with 51 seconds remaining.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of Pepperdine closing in on their lead, the Gauchos managed to secure their first victory at the free throw line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB kept its poise at the line, making 13-21 free throws in the fourth quarter alone as it ended 16-25. Miller and senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe led UCSB in its foul shooting, making a combined 13-18 from the line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An arid pass out of bounds by Bordonaro followed by a turnover in Pepperdine’s final two possessions of the game allowed UCSB to milk the clock in the game’s remaining 12 seconds, finalizing UCSB’s 66-57 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will hope to maintain their momentum on the road at Seattle University tonight at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74360\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74360\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/","id":312,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[311,310,309],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set to Host Pepperdine in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-14-at-9.34.48-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-14-at-9.34.48-PM.png?resize=662%2C435&ssl=1","description":"Entering its Tuesday home opener with an 0-1 record, the UCSB women's basketball team will attempt to overcome the losing start in its return to the T-Dome to host Pepperdine.

They drive it, they can create shots for themselves and screen well. Coming off our last game, we have to be able to defend 1-on-1 [[one-on-one]] better, work on keeping someone in front of us.”</p>\n<p>Both teams are looking to get on a winning track after season-opening losses, leaving them 0-1 entering Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Despite last season’s meeting against the Waves resulting in a close loss, the meeting marked the breakout of junior guard Makala Roper after a career-high 27 points in the loss. The performance led to Roper being moved from the bench to the starting lineup for the remainder of the 2015-16 season after having just six her freshman year.</p>\n<p>Finishing with 25 starts, Roper capitalized in her starting role. She led the Gauchos in scoring with 11.8 points per game and ended with a team-high six 20-plus point performances, four of which occurred after her career game against Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Roper will hope to have more of an impact on Tuesday after just eight points on 3-6 shooting from the field and a 2-4 showing from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Preventing Roper from getting into a shooting rhythm were her issues handling the ball as she finished the game with a game-high five turnovers. The Gauchos’ sharpshooter will look to overcome her miscues early in the season after ranking second in the Big West with an average of 4.0 turnovers per game the previous year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what ‘Rope’ does is a byproduct of the efforts of Onome and other players to drive and kick to her,” said Henrickson. “She does a good job of using screens and setting her feet. There are times when we want her to put the ball on the floor and drive it, [which is] an opportunity to manufacture some offense at the free-throw line. [Tuesday] will be a great opportunity for her to get back on track and be the player we all think she can be.”</p>\n<p>The issue with turnovers has plagued UCSB’s entire unit as its lax ball control resulted in it turning the ball over 24 times on Friday. The Gauchos were outscored 26-17 in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It was really just poor decisions. We tried to make plays that weren’t there,” said Henrickson. “We didn’t take what the defense gives us as opposed to [issues with] weak side help or we don’t seal inside. It’s never a one-player mistake. The guards have to do a better job; the bigs have to do a better job.”</p>\n<p>The inefficiencies when possessing the ball are reminiscent of last season’s start in which Santa Barbara ended leading the Big West with 18.5 turnovers per game. In 2015-16, it amassed 20-plus turnovers in 14 games, going 4-10.</p>\n<p>In addition to turnovers, the season opener highlighted how vulnerable the Gauchos are in the paint. They were at a disadvantage against the Cyclones, being outscored 46-20.</p>\n<p>“We did a poor job of recognizing weak side defense and at times we didn’t give the effort you need to be able to get a touch one-on-one inside,” Henrickson explained.</p>\n<p>Although a concern, the team is still conforming to the depth added to its frontcourt this offseason as it has made redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman the starter in her first year with the program. In 25 minutes of play, Edelman tallied six points on 3-6 shooting, a tied team-high six rebounds, and one block.</p>\n<p>There will be little room for error Tuesday night against Pepperdine, as even in their season opening loss against Long Beach State they held the 49ers to 44 points.</p>\n<p>Despite the defeat, the Waves managed to contain the 49ers to dismal shooting percentages of 20.9 percent from the field and 14.3 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine boasts a young roster that possesses just one senior within its total of six players returning from last year. It lost its best player, guard Erica Ogwumike, this offseason as the team’s leading scorer transferred to Rice University after averaging the fifth most points by a freshman in the nation with 18.4 PPG.</p>\n<p>An all-around talent, Ogwumike led the Waves in rebounds and steals per game at 7.5 and 1.9 per contest, respectively. She scored 22 points in the Waves’ win over the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>However, the loss has opened opportunities for other players that could potentially fill the Waves’ void.</p>\n<p>Returning from an injury last season and leading Pepperdine in scoring in its season opener was redshirt freshman Sydney Bordonaro. She finished with a game-high 12 points, going 4-10 from the field. Bordonaro’s 3-5 finish from behind the three-point line carried the Waves’ 40 percent shooting from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As the lone senior on the team, guard Allie Green topped Ogwumike’s points in the first meeting. She went off for team-high 24 points on 9-15 shooting and was 1-1 from behind the three-pointer. She will look to clean up her shooting after a 4-16 outing from the field and 11 points in the team’s opener.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Pepperdine will tip-off at 7 p.m. this Tuesday, Nov. 15 in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74179\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74179\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/","id":311,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[310,309,308],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Earns Blowout Victory in Exhibition vs. CSULA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was clear sailing for the UCSB women's basketball team in its 90-53 exhibition victory over Cal State Los Angeles on Sunday.

You know who is on the court with you and how to get them the ball.”</p>\n<p>With a focus this offseason to improve the team’s pace of play, the Gauchos’ work was evident as they played to an up-tempo beat.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara capitalized on defense, stifling the Golden Eagles’ offense in points off turnovers 23-3. CSULA shot 32.8 percent on a 19-58 shooting effort and 25 percent from behind the three, going 5-20 from deep.</p>\n<p>UCSB managed to establish its quicker play on the offensive end, embarking on a 7-0 run in the game’s opening minutes. Making her presence felt and appearing in her first game as a Gaucho after transferring from USC was redshirt junior Drew Edelman.</p>\n<p>Listed as a forward on the team’s roster, Edelman started at the center position instead and had success in the paint. She scored six of the Gauchos’ first nine points en route to ending the game with a double-double of 10 points and a tied game-high total of 10 rebounds in 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ scoring stretch in the game’s early minutes led to a Golden Eagles timeout. CSULA benefited from the quick break, going on a 7-2 run of its own to trim UCSB’s lead to 9-7.</p>\n<p>Igniting the Golden Eagles’ scoring charge was a three-point make by sophomore guard Christine Delapina. Bringing the team within two points was a layup by freshman guard Da’Jah Jackson, who led CSULA in scoring, rebounding and steals with 12 points, five rebounds and two steals.</p>\n<p>Despite coming near, the Golden Eagles were unable to ever tie or take the lead as UCSB registered its best shooting quarter of the night in the first. It shot 11-16 from the field for a 68.8 percentage and 3-6 from long distance.</p>\n<p>The efficient shooting occurred during the Gauchos’ 20-4 run to close out the first period. Setting the stage for UCSB’s scoring outburst was sophomore guard Coco Miller. Able to halt CSULA’s surge with a three-pointer to give UCSB a 12-7 lead, Miller’s make from deep was the start to the Gauchos’ rout.</p>\n<p>Miller concluded the night 5-10, 3-8 from deep for 14 points alongside five rebounds and two steals.</p>\n<p>With 10 players getting at least five minutes of play in Sunday night’s game, the Gauchos’ depth was on full display. Although its shooting stroke seemed nearly flawless, UCSB’s high-scoring performance resulted from its initial plan to attack the paint.</p>\n<p>“We started the game by throwing it to Drew,” said Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. “You have to be good around the rim because then it forces ‘are you gonna guard the rim or are you gonna give us threes?’ That stretches the defense, but if you can’t be good around the rim, you’ll stretch it then can’t do anything. [For] every really good team, if you’re good right there you have a chance, especially if you put three-point shooters around the outside.”</p>\n<p>Achieving the drive and kick game plan was no issue for UCSB as it consistently penetrated the paint, sucking in the Golden Eagles’ defense, then converted with three-point makes.</p>\n<p>Unafraid to shoot the ball when given the chance was the team’s leading scorer Porter. She went 5-11 from behind the three-point line; just two of her total seven field goals were inside the line to cap off a near double-double with eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>Either driving to the paint for layups or to dish the ball to the perimeter were Toler and senior guard Onome Jemerigbe. Along with Toler’s assists, Jemerigbe chipped in six dimes of her own to go with just one turnover. UCSB doubled the Golden Eagles’ amount of assists 20-9.</p>\n<p>Also helping the Gauchos spread the floor and get the ball to their shooters was their advantage in rebounds. They outrebounded CSULA 54-33. Tying with Edelman for the lead in rebounds was junior small forward Taylor Farris with 10.</p>\n<p>Although Sunday’s game was only an exhibition, it was an encouraging performance for UCSB heading into its season opener this Friday. It reached the 90-point mark just once last season in a 93-78 win over Morehead State and was one point shy against La Verne.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins its 2016-17 campaign on the road at Iowa State this Friday, Nov. 11 at 10 a.m. PST at the Hilton Coliseum.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73947\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73947\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/","id":302,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[301,300,299],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Square Off Against CSULA At Home Sunday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FILEPHOTO-CD-WomensBasketball12-1-15_9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FILEPHOTO-CD-WomensBasketball12-1-15_9-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Year two of the Bonnie Henrickson era will begin this Sunday when the UCSB women's basketball team faces visiting Cal State LA in an exhibition match at the Thunderdome.

The Golden Eagles finished 6-3 in their last nine games of the season and were able to lock up the No. 8 seed in the California Collegiate Athletic Association Championship Tournament before being eliminated by No. 1 seed Cal State Dominguez Hills. CSULA finished 10-17 overall and 8-12 in CCAA play.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UCSB’s improvement of eight wins last season ranked 13th in the nation after having just two wins the previous year.</p>\n<p>The team’s growth shall continue as it returned all five of its starters and introduced new talent to its squad with five newcomers.</p>\n<p>At the core of the Gauchos’ growth was their defense. UCSB finished third in the Big West in points allowed per game with a 62.8 average. It continued its stout defensive efforts during its conference schedule as well, improving to second in allowing just 61.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>As a team with more depth in both the back and front courts, Sunday’s game should be another step toward the Gauchos trying to finalize their starting lineup and bench rotations.</p>\n<p>Improving UCSB’s backcourt is the addition of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. Forced to sit out last season due to NCAA transfer rules, the former Oregon Duck has displayed her ability to consistently play at a high level on both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>During her time at Oregon, it was not until the latter half of her second season that she saw more playing time, playing in 29 games and starting in 12 of the team’s last 13 contests. She averaged career totals of 3.9 points and 2.35 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Although the backcourt duo of Toler and senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe is no guarantee — possibly making the Gauchos too small in size — the pairing of the two could possibly result in the fastest, most agile backcourt in the Big West.</p>\n<p>As either another option in UCSB’s backcourt or as a stretch guard or small forward, redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter is another Gaucho that was stashed away due to NCAA transfer rules.</p>\n<p>Joining UCSB after a season of very limited minutes at Ole Miss, Porter seems to have a natural knack for scoring based on her time at Horizon Christian Academy.<br>\nShe set a single-game school record for most three-pointers made with eight and concluded her high school career with 1,292 points.</p>\n<p>Upgrading the depth of the Gauchos’ frontcourt were the 2016 recruiting additions of centers redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman and freshman center Natalia Bruening; their class also included freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez.</p>\n<p>The pair of 6’4” post players provides UCSB with the opportunity to improve on the boards and lessens its reliance on a “small-ball” lineup.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ranked seventh in the Big West in defensive rebounds per game with an average of 35.3. Their inconsistencies when collecting boards while defending led to their issues in allowing second chance points. Including conference play, UCSB was outscored 479-339 in second-chance points.</p>\n<p>Edelman, who will be eligible to play this season, played in a total of 36 games while with the Trojans. She did not have much of a role, averaging just 1.2 and 1.35 rebounds per game in two seasons at USC, but can be of help to the Gauchos who were short on length in their interior. She grabbed a career-high seven rebounds during her sophomore year.</p>\n<p>Coming out of Corona del Mar High School, Bruening enters UCSB after setting school records for career rebounds and blocks during her time with the Sea Kings. Nimble around the rim, Bruening brings vertical ability to UCSB’s paint presence with her volleyball background as well.</p>\n<p>Despite all five of its starters returning, UCSB’s latest additions provide the team with an array of possible changes to come which could lead to a tweak in the starting five or a deeper dependence on the depth within its bench.</p>\n<p>Similar to the circumstances UCSB faced last season in introducing Henrickson to the program, Cal State L.A. finds itself in the same position as Sunday will be a glimpse into the Golden Eagles under the helm of first-year Head Coach Cheryl Miller.</p>\n<p>Enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, Miller is a legend in the game of basketball both as a player and coach. She helped bring two consecutive national championships to USC in 1983 and 1984, earning NCAA Tournament MVP honors twice in her collegiate career.</p>\n<p>Cal State L.A. had a total of four different players average double figures in scoring last season. However, just one of these top-scorers, junior center Rikke Fabricius, is returning after being third on in scoring and rebounding with 11.6 and 4.4 rebounds per game. She tallied double digits in points in 19 games.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s exhibition game will begin at 5 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November, 3 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73705\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73705\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/gauchos-to-square-off-against-csula-at-home-sunday/","id":337,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[336,335,334],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Swim Sweeps Mustangs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2016-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.29_StephenManga_Swim-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.29_StephenManga_Swim-5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite individual losses when either of the two teams competed individually, the UCSB men's and women's swim teams prevailed with victories in their first dual meet match of the 2016 season against B...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After experiencing losses in each of their season openers, both the UCSB men’s and women’s swimming teams earned their first victories of the season.

Earning the team’s victory was freshman Paul Rogers in the men’s 200-yard freestyle with a finishing time of 1:40:74.</p>\n<p>Nearly edging Cal Poly for this victory was UCSB’s sophomore Eric VanBrocklin as he narrowly trailed Rogers with a second place finish of 1:41:15.</p>\n<p>Yet, making up for the runner-up result were the women who represented UCSB in the 100-yard backstroke.

A runner-up in the 100 backstroke at the MPSF Championships last season, Low outswam the rest of the competition for the victory with a time of 55.11.</p>\n<p>Not too far behind was Stevens with a finals time of 56.90. Placing in third was freshman Tara Middleton, finishing her backstroke at a time of 58.38.</p>\n<p>Earning Cal Poly another first-place finish was the individual victory of freshman Hailey Houck in the women’s 200-yard fly with a time of 2:03:63.</p>\n<p>Although both the men and women had a clear path to victory, UCSB’s absence of a diving program served as free points for the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>However, helping pave the way for UCSB’s women’s team were the individual efforts of Low, Mikota and Quintana as they finished with two individual wins each.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos captured their last two first-place finishes in the women’s 200-yard IM and the women’s 400-yard free relay.</p>\n<p>Tallying the best time with a final result of 2:06:40 was junior Alyssa Shew in the 200-yard IM. Almost claiming first place behind her was Quintana with a finishing time of 2:06:68.</p>\n<p>Winning ahead of Cal Poly’s relay team by almost more than six seconds, UCSB’s “A” squad of Low, Mikota, sophomore Lilly Helmuth-Malone and freshman Catherine Boles registered their first-place finish with a time of 3:26:78.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s “A” group came in second place with a final time of 3:32:48. In spite of its men’s 400-yard relay team claiming first in Saturday’s final event, clocking in at 3:07:84, the Mustangs slow start to begin the match set them too far behind to match UCSB’s pace throughout the day.</p>\n<p>UCSB will remain at Campus Pool for its second dual meet match of the season. The Gauchos will host UC San Diego this Satuday, Nov. 5 with the first event set to begin at 11 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

however, can we truly distinguish OBJ within the cohort of diva receivers?</p>\n<p>What I like to consider as the entertainers of an offense, wideouts suitably have a more flashy approach to the game in comparison to other positions on the field.</p>\n<p>As a receiver, the mentality is different.</p>\n<p>Matched up one-on-one against a cornerback for the majority of a game, some receivers’ mindsets are ingrained with the notion they can’t be stopped by any defender on the field.</p>\n<p>Adding a diva presence to this outlook can be the flashy celebrations or nonchalant attitudes toward the media that some receivers express.</p>\n<p>With a history of receivers such as Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, Terrell Owens and Randy Moss as prime examples within the class of divas, it seems every few years there is a new name that emerges.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73496\" style=\"width: 418px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73496\" data-attachment-id=\"73496\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/football1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?fit=2550%2C3300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2550,3300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"football1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?fit=791%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73496\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1-791x1024.jpg?resize=408%2C528\" alt=\"Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus\" width=\"408\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?resize=791%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 791w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?resize=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73496\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Known for his touchdown celebrations, blond-dyed hair, Head &amp; Shoulders commercials, gracing the Madden 2016 cover, having a friendship with Drake and, of course, the unforgettable one-handed catch, Beckham is constantly surrounded by the glitz and glamour of superstardom, especially while in one of the nation’s biggest markets: New York.</p>\n<p>Currently in his third season, Beckham is well-deserving of the praise he receives for his performance on the field. His 2,744 receiving yards through his first two seasons is the most in NFL history, eclipsing the previous record of 2,726 yards set by Randy Moss.</p>\n<p>Although his immediate impact will be considered, the question of whether Beckham belongs within the diva class still persists.</p>\n<p>Quite frankly, the answer is no. Beckham is not a diva.</p>\n<p>It’s as if people have forgotten the exuberance and appreciation we had when tuning in not to watch the New York Giants play but rather to see the performance of Odell Beckham Jr.</p>\n<p>From the pregame catching drills full of one-handed snags to graceful jumps in the air displaying his vertical explosiveness, Beckham has served as the main attraction since his introduction to the Big City of Dreams.</p>\n<p>Sure, each player has their own way of expressing their anger when frustrated or dealing with overcoming the challenge of biting on the bait of an opponent, but is it plausible to define a player by such a behavior?</p>\n<p>In the case of Beckham, excluding his fiery and sensitive character when on the field, he hasn’t been a true detriment to the Giants’ success.</p>\n<p>While he deserves to be held accountable for the penalties he has amassed this season, a total of three (one apiece for taunting, unsportsmanlike conduct and offensive pass interference), Beckham has yet to be the reason as to why the Giants have lost games.</p>\n<p>With Super Bowl XLVI being the New York Giants’ last postseason appearance, it’s safe to say that OBJ is not an inhibiting element in the team’s playoff hopes.</p>\n<p>But football is a team sport in which brotherhood is vital to the locker-room culture, right? No individual player should be excused of the team’s successes and failures, correct?</p>\n<p>Despite the truths of both of these questions, the team loyalty of players such as quarterback Eli Manning and first-year Head Coach Ben McAdoo has to be acknowledged as they both proclaimed Beckham’s sideline acts to be a distraction to the team.</p>\n<p>Yes, Beckham was a distraction. But shouldn’t these issues be attended to and resolved internally? The calling out of Beckham just added more fuel to the fire in painting the progression of the wideout receiving the diva label.</p>\n<p>By making claims of football not being fun anymore to celebrating on the sidelines, mocking his incident with the kicking net in the form of a proposal, Beckham has become one of the league’s most unpredictable personalities.</p>\n<p>Of course it is always more appealing to be on the positive end of this spectrum, but sometimes the reserved or under under-the-radar demeanor of some players doesn’t exist for all.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider the Hall of Fame career of Terrell Owens.</p>\n<p>Second in all-time NFL career receiving yards with 15, 934 yards, third in receiving touchdowns at 153, sixth all-time in career receptions with 1,078 receptions, the record holder for receptions in a single-game with 20 to go along with a multitude of other accolades, Owens is one of the greatest wide receivers in NFL history.</p>\n<p>While his renowned talent and statistical achievements surpass the qualifications of a Hall of Fame nomination, it was the diva stigma that prevented Owens from being a first ballot Hall of Famer.</p>\n<p>Yes, Owens was a diva, beyond the behavior of Beckham thus far. Yes, he did play on five different teams in his NFL career. But, most importantly, he produced when it mattered most and at some point reigned as the league’s best wide receiver. These are facts that should have outweighed personality in the evaluation of Owens.</p>\n<p>Two different players, two different personalities cut from a different cloth.</p>\n<p>The narrative of the diva wide receiver remains and is here to stay. However, the headlines and perceptions formed are only parts to a story that has yet to be fully disclosed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/","id":1914,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1913,1912,1911],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB vs. SLO: A Rivalry Made in Soccer Heaven","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer_vsCalPoly-CROWD-20151024-DustinHarris-1-print-e1539542402765.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer_vsCalPoly-CROWD-20151024-DustinHarris-1-print-e1539542402765.jpg?resize=900%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A historically popular matchup, the Blue-Green rivalry was listed as the greatest rivalry in college soccer.

Better known as the Blue-Green rivalry, it is a rivalry that has emerged as the nation’s most prolific duel to date.</p>\n<p>Ranked as the No. 1 rivalry on <em>CollegeSoccerNews.com’s</em> list of “The Fourteen Greatest Rivalries in College Soccer,” the meeting between the Gauchos and Mustangs has continued to meet the expectations and anticipation of audiences nationwide.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With both programs being members of the Big West North Division, the storied matchup is an annual battle that takes place twice a year, giving fans the opportunity to brag and express pride in supporting the Gauchos or Mustangs.</p>\n<p>A match full of intensity and high emotion, goals are a rarity that take much effort, as 16 of the last 19 matches between UCSB and Cal Poly have been decided by one goal or have resulted in a draw.</p>\n<p>Thus far, it has been UCSB with the advantage over Cal Poly. The Gauchos’ all-time record when facing their Central Coast rival is 46-18-8 after a recent 2-1 defeat of the Mustangs last Saturday while on the road in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>In his 18th season with UCSB, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg owns a 23-7-6 record when facing the Mustangs. It has been nearly two decades since his takeover of the Gauchos’ sideline, yet no introduction to the Blue-Green rivalry was needed for Vom Steeg in his transition to the helm as he was a student and soccer player at UCSB from 1985-1988.</p>\n<p>While the rivalry is one that expands across generations of athletes, students and fans, the classic match has consistently increased in popularity on a national scale.</p>\n<p>Since the start of the 2007 season, the total amount of people that have witnessed the Gaucho-Mustang battle exceeds the 200,000 mark.</p>\n<p>The contest has even surpassed the attendance numbers of postseason competition that has occurred in both NCAA Tournament and College Cup games, resulting in eight of the highest attended collegiate games in the U.S. in the last four years.</p>\n<p>Although on the road, last Saturday’s attendance of 11,075 signaled the seventh sellout for a Cal Poly men’s soccer game in program history. It is a game that has sold out Alex G. Spanos Stadium for the past six seasons.</p>\n<p>Increasing in size with the addition of 1,097 attendees, the attendance of the last five meetings between UCSB and Cal Poly — dating back to 2011-2015 — has not fell below the total of 12,805.</p>\n<p>Well deserving of its moniker as the “Soccer Heaven” of collegiate soccer, Harder Stadium has been a hub to the multitude of attendance records set over the years.</p>\n<p>Over the course of nine straight years, UCSB has led Division I men’s soccer in average attendance. For the last two seasons, it has recorded the top average of 3,844 fans per match. The Gauchos’ 5,873 attendees per match in 2010 remains the highest average since the NCAA began accounting for the statistical category in 1998.</p>\n<p>Last season’s two meetings concluded with single-game attendance highs for both programs as they were the only two schools to reach tens of thousands.</p>\n<p>The total of 14,919 fans that attended the second matchup between the Gauchos and Mustangs at Harder Stadium ranked above all games on the list. Following was the first game of the 2015-2016 Blue-Green series in which 11,075 people were in attendance.</p>\n<p>Since the reinstatement of men’s soccer into the Big West Conference in 2001, the Blue-Green bout has gradually grown each year as the purpose of the rivalry has extended beyond the field, becoming a ritual amongst both universities. The Blue-Green game is the only exception in which students are allowed to storm the field at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>The legend of the Blue-Green rivalry continues this Saturday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m. and will be nationally televised by Fox Sports Prime Ticket for the fourth consecutive year.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/ucsb-vs-slo-a-rivalry-made-in-soccer-heaven/","id":1428,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1427,1426,1425],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 7 UCSB’s Winning Streak Snapped, Lose at No. 3 USC","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MWaPo_BenPu-for11172015-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MWaPo_BenPu-for11172015-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Riding the high of a three-game winning streak, the No. 7 Gauchos fell flat on their face at No. 3 USC being blown out 16-6.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Lapses on defense in the second period of Sunday’s match against No. 3 USC ultimately led to the 16-6 defeat of the No. 7 UCSB men’s water polo team.</p>\n<p>With the score tied 4-4 at the 6:46 mark of the quarter, things took a turn for the worse when the Trojans put together a 5-0 scoring run to build a comfortable lead over the Gauchos as the game progressed.</p>\n<p>Finishing its sleight of five games in four days with a 0-2 record against two of the nation’s top three teams, UCSB had its three-match winning streak end in its loss to USC.

After leading Santa Barbara with a team-high four goals in its victory over Whittier the day before, the Serbian native continued his offensive dominance, leading the Gauchos with a hat trick.</p>\n<p>Answering for USC on offense was junior driver Matteo Morelli to tie the score at 1-1. Despite UCSB managing to exchange goals with USC through the opening minutes of the second quarter, sparking the Trojans’ run was the commanding emergence of junior driver Blake Edwards.</p>\n<p>An All-American and All-MPSF First Team selection, Edwards reached the back of the net three times during USC’s 5-0 scoring stretch. He finished with a match-high five goals, increasing his count of multi-goal games to eight in addition to having a score in 13 of the Trojans’ 16 games.</p>\n<p>It was a monumental performance for the team’s leading scorer as Edwards became the 33rd player in program history to reach a career total of 100 goals. His five first-half scores guided the Trojans to their 11-5 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>The flow of the game was at a standstill in the beginning stages of the second half as both teams attempted a combined nine shots before having the goal drought ended by USC’s junior driver Lazar Pasuljevic’s score with 2:19 remaining in the match.</p>\n<p>Scoring UCSB’s lone goal in the second half was junior attacker Nick Wiley. Despite the Gauchos taking a more efficient approach to their shot selection, improving from a 0.81 shooting percentage on 37 shots in their first meeting against the Trojans to a .222 percentage on 27 shots on Sunday, UCSB remained unable to match the Trojans’ attack.</p>\n<p>Ending Sunday’s match with a .485 shooting percentage on 33 shots, USC’s persistence in power-play situations helped the team collect another victory.
