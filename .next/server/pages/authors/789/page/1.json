Periodically, our RA will put out free feminine products and condoms. My roommate will sometimes come back from class and see a small red square placed in the center of her desk. It’s a running joke: “I thought I’d help you with your endeavors,” my other roommate would comment.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87892\" style=\"width: 364px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87892\" data-attachment-id=\"87892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/sexlesswhite/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sexlesswhite-e1556772765124.png?fit=650%2C622&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,622\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sexlesswhite\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sexlesswhite-e1556772765124.png?fit=250%2C239&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sexlesswhite-e1556772765124.png?fit=888%2C850&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87892\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sexlesswhite-250x239.png?resize=354%2C338\" alt=\"\" width=\"354\" height=\"338\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is known for having a very active party culture, including — among other things — drugs, alcohol and, of course, hookups. The message behind having free condoms readily available is essentially a reminder to be safe, an acknowledgement that sex will probably take place so it’s best to be prepared for it. At the beginning of  fall quarter, I saw free condoms being put out, along with tampons and pads. I observed that contraceptives and feminine products were being categorized together, implying some degree of transferability regarding their necessity. This is something I disagree with. You cannot will your period to stop, as awesome as that would be, but (in a perfect world) you can choose whether or not you’d like to have sex.  My discomfort, of course, does not translate into support for any sort of regulation, policing or actions that should be taken. I look back now and see the right to participate freely and explore your sexual identity as something that years of sexual liberation, progress and technological innovation has brought to us. I do however, disagree with the conflation of what I see as cultural pressure to participate in casual sex with being liberated, progressive and “woke.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though feminism and the detachment of sex from traditional stigmas may appear to inevitably support casual sex, that does not mean it is necessarily emotionally healthy. According to a study published by the </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/moniTor/2013/02/ce-corner\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Psychological Association</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on undergraduate students, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">78 percent of women and 72 percent of men who had uncommitted sex (including vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex) reported a history of experiencing regret following such an encounter.” This is all well and good because it’s the individual’s personal choice. But what if we zoom out and observe the cultural implications?</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first exposure to the idea of casual sex was … an </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/09/25/552582404/hookup-culture-the-unspoken-rules-of-sex-on-college-campuses\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NPR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the distinctive characteristics of hookup culture.

From a young age, my perception of casual sex was colored by this study. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I saw college parties as a setting for these non-inclusive, hyperheterosexual, primal activities. Also, being in a long-term relationship and coming into this campus as a first-year, I observed the active party culture going on around me. Drawing from my preconceptions I felt skeptical and hesitant to embrace that culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to numbers, my caricatured idea of college life may be incorrect. From a </span><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.12930\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40-year study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted between 1976 and 2016 on 18 million teenagers, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">54% of high school students in 1991 reported having had sex, while only 41% did in the early 2010s.  This study even suggests that “today’s 18-year-old more closely resembles a 15-year-old of the 1970s or ’80s.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So even though it may feel like everyone around me is “doing the deed” 24/7, we are actually participating in less sex than older generations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the reasoning behind this? Perhaps there are more romantics among us today who feel as I do and are more likely to give it some time. Or maybe people are generally less interested in dating earlier on. Or it may be that the definition of sex and intimacy has changed. It ultimately boils down to several factors, the center of it all being technology.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact is that sex is just one of the many choices at your disposal as a young adult, and as long as you’re informed and consent to it, it can be fun.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has changed the game. Sexting, snapchat sex, porn and all the resources the internet has to offer have joined forces to </span><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/6-ways-sex-is-different-between-gen-z-millennials-according-to-a-survey-16924538\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divert teens’ focus from physical sex to online sex.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At the same time, technological advances and more resources mean that each generation is living longer, so having sex later on in your life may be a symptom of the “slow-life strategy,” discussed in the </span><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.12930\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mentioned above. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the study, this phenomenon fits into a larger trend of kids staying kids longer due to lengthened lifespans and </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z-sex-alcohol-driving-study-2017-9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more present parental supervision</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today’s teens were found to be less likely to drive, work for pay, go on dates, have sex, or go out without their parents.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has affected sex in other ways. With so much to do on social media and streaming services, </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z-sex-alcohol-driving-study-2017-9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more people prefer to stay in and use devices </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">instead of, say, go out to do drugs, drink alcohol and find partners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though statistics support this view of people our age, our campus appears to oppose the general data about Gen Z’s sexual habits. Could the reputation of UCSB’s social life create a concentration of people more interested in sex, alcohol and drugs, thereby exempting this population from a generalized claim? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be an interesting thing to think about, but in the end it should not affect the way you go about your life. I may have had my preconceived notions about casual sex and even taken a moral stance on it back then, but the fact is that sex is just one of the many choices at your disposal as a young adult, and as long as you’re informed and consent to it, it can be fun. Just stay safe out there.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marie Stevenson wants Gauchos to weigh the risks and rewards of sexual activity.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87891\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87891\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/","id":6389,"author":{"id":789,"name":"Marie Stevenson"},"related":[6388,6387,6386],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/789"}},"__N_SSG":true}
