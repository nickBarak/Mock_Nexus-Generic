Steph has also already beaten his old NBA record of three-pointers made in a season with 288 with still over a month left in the regular season.</p>\n<p>Based on the amount of three-pointers he’s made through the first 58 games, Curry would finish this season with about 400 three-pointers, about a 40 percent increase over his record-setting performance from last season.</p>\n<p>To shed some perspective to fans outside of the basketball community, that would be as though if the current NFL record of 55 touchdown passes suddenly shot up to 77. Or in baseball, the home run record, which is currently at 77, suddenly shot up to over 100 — 102 to be exact — home runs in a season which would be incredible.</p>\n<p>When thinking of Curry’s season in that light, how could someone not believe that this season has been absolutely amazing?</p>\n<p>Normally, that stat alone would be enough, but it doesn’t even tell half the story because it’s not just the fact that Curry is making threes, it’s about where he is making it from.</p>\n<p>From 28-40 feet, Curry has made 36 three-pointers, tripling the amount of the next player on the list while shooting an astonishing 68 percent.</p>\n<p>To shed more light on how amazing that statistic is, a player would have to be shooting almost 95 percent from inside the three-point line to be as efficient as Curry is from 28-40 feet. The highest shooting percentage someone has ever posted inside the arch is Wilt Chamberlin’s 72 percent.</p>\n<p>Steph has also broken the record for consecutive games with at least one three-pointer made with 128, beating Kyle Korver’s former record of 127. And although Korver is one of the best three-point shooters in the history of the league, his streak was mostly extended by games with one, two or three makes, while more than half of Curry’s games involve at least four triples.</p>\n<p>Now even if we move the conversation to advanced analytics, Curry would still be dominating the attention. This season, Steph’s 32.96 player efficiency rating (P.E.R.), a formula used to rate every player’s statistical performance, would be the best in NBA history if the season ended today.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that Curry isn’t exactly playing every minute of the game.</p>\n<p>In fact, most nights when the Warriors are blowing out a team, Curry will sit and miss out on precious minutes that could further enhance his stats.</p>\n<p>Currently, No. 30 for Golden State averages, 33.9 minutes per game, 33rd most in the league, yet he still leads the league in points per game with 30.7 and is tied for first among guards for best field goal percentage with .515.</p>\n<p>Using the advanced analytic per-minute statistics — a formula used to determine the quality of minutes played by a single player — Curry is even more dangerous.</p>\n<p>For points per 48 minutes, the advanced metric determines that Curry would be averaging 43.5 points per game. The next closest on the list would be Demarcus Cousins with 38 PPG, almost a six-point difference.</p>\n<p>Now people will always talk down Curry by bringing up the G.O.A.T., Michael Jordan, which is fair; I mean he is Michael Jordan. However, in this particular case it doesn’t fit the narrative. In terms of just one season, Curry has been lights-out; even better than Jordan.</p>\n<p>For example, Curry’s OBPM, offensive-box plus minus, is currently at 13.2 which is more than Jordan’s record of 9.8. This 3.4-point gap between the two stars is equivalent to Jordan and the 71st-best player on that list.</p>\n<p>There is also no doubt that Curry has been an absolute catalyst for his team. Currently, the Warriors are 54-5 overall — the best start through 59 games in NBA history — and Curry and his deadly shooting have played a big part in that.</p>\n<p>Without Curry, the Warriors wouldn’t have the great chance they have to break the all-time NBA record of best regular season record which is currently at 72-10 by Jordan’s ’96 Chicago Bulls. It would be only fitting that the team with the best record in NBA history would be led by the player who had the best season in NBA history.</p>\n<p>But honestly, stats are nothing compared to witnessing the man in action. If you want to witness history, then turn on your TV and put on a Warriors game; it doesn’t matter who it’s against. Then sit down and watch Curry pull up from ridiculous spots on the court and drain them as announcers and fans look in awe.</p>\n<p>I can give you all the stats in the world, but it’s nothing compared to watching Curry devastate the Thunder and their fans by pulling up from 32 feet and draining the shot as if it was nothing to him.<br>\nSome old-school fans and analysts (and the occasional haters) will try to say that if Curry was in another era, this wouldn’t be happening. To those people I say, “Who cares?” Time is progressive, it goes forward not back, so there is no point in playing hypotheticals.</p>\n<p>All we can do is witness history as it happens, and I guarantee what Curry is doing might not happen again for a long time. The game isn’t what it was in the ’70s, the ’80s, the ’90s or even the 2000s. It has evolved into a different game and the person who is leading that change is Stephen Curry.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying Curry is better than Jordan. I’m not saying he will ever be better than the G.O.A.T. He might, but that’s not my point. My point is that, right now, Curry is having possibly the best season ever, and we should appreciate every moment the baby-faced assassin gives us.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of March 3, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Bruins began the slugfest thanks to redshirt senior Eric Filia’s two-run homer that put his team up 2-0 after the top of the inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to respond with runs of their own in the bottom of the inning due in large part to blunders by UCLA. The No. 21 team in the country allowed three walks and committed two errors that led to two runs for UCSB. The other was thanks to designated hitter Austin Bush’s sac fly RBI that brought in Calica.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara added two more runs in the second inning thanks to Bush’s single that brought in two more runners. This made the score 5-2 in favor of the home team. UCLA would then respond in the top of the third inning getting three runs and tying the game up at five.</p>\n<p>The third top frame resurgence started when junior outfielder Kort Peterson hit a triple bringing in Filia to score. Junior Luke Persico and redshirt freshman Scott Jarvis also had RBI. In the bottom of the third, however, redshirt sophomore Josh Adams hit a home run (1) to put the Gauchos back up, 6-5.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning UCSB would again add three more runs to its lead courtesy of more wild pitches thrown by the Bruins. Sophomore Clay Fisher started the scoring having an RBI-single. After that the next two runs were scored by wild pitches making the score 9-5 in favor of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>UCLA would add one run in the sixth inning courtesy of a Filia RBI-single down the left-field line, however, it could not do much more than that. The pitching by reshirt junior Trevor Bettancourt, sophomore Kyle Nelson, and sophomore Alex Garcia in the final three innings proved to be too much as the Bruins only mustered one hit.</p>\n<p>“Bullpens are like boxes of chocolate; you never know what you’re going to get.” Checketts said. “We got some guys that are good and are starting to settle into roles.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would add two more runs in the eighth inning thanks to another great hit from Bush and another wild pitch which made the final score 11-6.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, UCLA had many blunders that cost them the game as they had two errors and had four wild pitches which led to three runs by UCSB. It still had some solid performances such as Filia who went 3-4 with a home run and an RBI.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also saw great performances, most notably from Bush who continues hit hot streak. The Big West Field Player of the Week and Gwynn Classic MVP had another big night going 3-4 from the plate with four RBI.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to be hitting this good.” Bush said. “The guys before me in the line-up are doing great and it allows me to see some better pitches that I can take advantage of.”</p>\n<p>It was also good to see Bettancourt bounce back from his disappointing performance last week in which he gave up five runs against St. Mary’s which ultimately doomed them. The junior bounced back in a big way giving up one hit while striking out his four batters.</p>\n<p>“Bettancourt last week wasn’t himself.” Checketts said. “I knew that and I still have great confidence in him and I think what we saw today is what we are going to see going forward.”</p>\n<p>Although the Bruins made their share fair of mistakes, the fact remains that the Gauchos are on fire right now. They have scored over 10 runs in three of their last four games and have been blowing teams out. Only time will tell if this hot hitting can continue, but for right now it is a treat to watch.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next opponent is Oregon in a three-game series which begins Friday, March 4th at PK Park at 6 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Looking to continue its dominance from the weekend, the UCSB baseball team is hot on both sides on the field as it gets ready to take on one of its best opponents on the schedule, No. 21 UCLA.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos come in to Tuesday’s home match-up with a solid 7-1 record and currently riding a three-game winning streak. The Bruins head to Caesar Uyesaka stadium with a 3-4 record, however, they are coming off their first series win of the season after taking two of three from Cal Poly SLO.</p>\n<p>Although the No. 21 team in the country does not currently hold a .500 record, it is still one of the more dangerous teams in the country. UCLA has beaten quality opponents like No. 6 North Carolina and just recently beat Cal Poly SLO 19-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Leading the Bruins on the offensive charge is junior outfielder Kort Peterson.  The Mountain View native currently leads the team in batting average batting .429 (10-24) and leads the team in hits with 10.</p>\n<p>Senior Brett Urabe and redshirt senior Christoph Bono help on the bats as both are tied for first on their team in RBI with 5.</p>\n<p>Another great thing UCLA saw on Saturday’s 19-0 win over SLO was the coming-out party for redshirt freshman Jarvis Scott. In his collegiate debut, the infielder got on base on all six plate appearances, went 5-5 with four runs, three RBI and one walk.</p>\n<p>On the mound for the Bruins in this game will be freshman Justin Hooper. The left-handed pitcher has been somewhat shaky in his two innings pitched this season posting a 9.00 ERA after allowing three hits and two runs. Hooper should be weary of his opponents because if he is not careful, he will get blown out of the mound by UCSB’s great hitting prowess.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos carry hot bats into Tuesday’s game coming off a great 36 run, 40 hit weekend that led them to winning the inaugural Tony Gwynn Classic. Just to shed some perspective, the Gauchos scored 36 runs in their three games this past weekend while the Bruins have only scored 40 runs in all of their games played so far this season.</p>\n<p>One particularly hot player coming into this game is designated hitter, Austin Bush. The sophomore was named MVP this past weekend at the tournament for his .636 (7-11) BA, six RBI, six run performance. Bush is also first on the team and the Big West conference in batting average posting a .500 (10-20) BA. He is also second on the team in RBI with eight.</p>\n<p>He is helped by third baseman Ryan Clark. One of two senior starters on the roster, Clark is also coming off a hot tournament performance in which he was name All-Tournament Honoree after posting a .583 (7-12) BA, seven RBI, two runs and one homerun—his first of the season.</p>\n<p>The senior is tied for first on the team and tied for third in the Big West in RBI with 9 runners batted in so far. He is also third in the Big West conference in batting average posting a .481 (13-27) BA.</p>\n<p>Second baseman J.J. Muno is also someone that cannot be forgotten about. The redshirt sophomore has had a great start to the season as he is tied for first on the team in homeruns and RBI with one and nine respectively. He is 19<sup>th</sup> in the conference in batting average with a .333 (11-33) BA.</p>\n<p>On the mound for the Gauchos will be sophomore Chris Clements. The right-handed pitcher has had a solid start to the season posting a 2.16 ERA., 15<sup>th</sup> best in the conference, after allowing six hits and two runs on 8.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s bullpen is led by sophomore Kyle Nelson who has had an amazing start to the season. In 9.1 innings pitched, the left-handed pitcher has only allowed three hits and no runs. He has also struck out 16 batters, first on the team and third best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s game will be an important one for the Gauchos. It will be a chance to beat a very well respected team in UCLA, gain even more momentum for the long season, and start to show that although they are young they are a team that should not be overlooked, instead feared.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next game is Tuesday, March 1 against No. 21 UCLA at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Then in the third inning junior outfielder Hunter Mercado-Hood hit a sac fly to the deep right and tied the game at one.</p>\n<p>The Toreros then enjoyed a brief 2-1 lead after the top of the fourth as they added one run. The Gauchos responded with a three-run frame that was led by freshman outfielder Michael McAdoo hitting a fielder’s choice that batted one runner in and an error on the play led to another runner scoring. Senior third baseman Ryan Clark hit an RBI single and made the score 4-2 after four full frames.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its hot hitting in the fifth after another three-run bottom frame that seemingly put San Diego away as it could not answer back to that extent. UCSB sealed the championship victory after adding two more runs, compared to SD’s one run, and winning by a final score of 9-3.</p>\n<p>Designated hitter Austin Bush led the team going 3-3 in the championship round adding three runs scored as well. The sophomore was also honored with tournament MVP after a 7-11 weekend which included six RBI and one homer.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore Joe Record also continued his strong start to the season picking up his second win after going 6 1/3 innings deep allowing four hits and two earned runs.</p>\n<p>However, before the Gauchos had the opportunity to take home some nice hardware they first had to defeat previously undefeated Bryant University. They were able to punch their ticket to the championship game and hand the Bulldogs their first loss of the season after their best offensive showing of the year scoring 16 runs on 14 hits.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, Bryant started the scoring in the top of the third adding one run courtesy of junior Matt Albanese, however, it missed out on a great opportunity blowing a bases loaded scenario with only one out in the inning. It was Clark who made a diving catch when the ball was hit his way and turned it into a 5-4-3 double play.</p>\n<p>The senior then continued to help his team hitting his first home-run of the season and tying the game up at one. The Gauchos added three more runs to take a 4-1 lead after three innings of play.</p>\n<p>The game was still somewhat close as the score was 6-2 headed into the seventh inning when UCSB scored seven runs in that frame to put away Bryant. It continued to show its dominance adding three more runs in the final two innings to win the game by an impressive 16-2 score.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore J.J Muno continued his hot start to the season going 2-3 with two RBI. He was helped by Grover who went a perfect 3-3 and also had two RBI. Although the Gauchos had great hitting they were also helped by the Bulldogs eight walks and hitting six additional batters that attributed four runs.</p>\n<p>Pitching was also great as Freshman Noah Davis picked up his first win of the season after five strong innings allowing six hits and two runs while also adding four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Before the Gauchos best offensive output of the season, they had a strong start to the tournament against No. 22 Kentucky. UCSB scored 11 runs on 14 hits and had another strong performance from Shane Bieber.</p>\n<p>The junior right-handed pitcher was amazing at one point not allowing a single run until the seventh inning. Bieber then ran out of gas as he was ultimately pulled one out into the sixth inning after allowing three singles. He still picked up the win putting his record at a perfect 2-0.</p>\n<p>Bieber was also helped tremendously by yet another dominant performance by the Gaucho hitters. Five UCSB hitters got extra base hits including Bush’s 430-foot homerun in the top of the seventh inning. The future tournament MVP started his weekend strong going 3-5 and having two RBI.</p>\n<p>The scoring started early for Santa Barbara as it took a 3-0 lead after three runs in the second inning thanks to McAdoo’s RBI single, sophomore Clay Fisher’s RBI groundout and Clark’s RBI single. Clark picked up another RBI in the fourth inning after a solid single down the left field line making the score 4-0.</p>\n<p>As Kentucky was unable to score, the Gauchos decided to take advantage scoring four more runs in the fifth inning to take a commanding 8-0 lead. UCSB led 10-0 after the top of the seventh thanks to Bush’s aforementioned HR and Clark’s third RBI of the day.</p>\n<p>Although Kentucky made a strong push in the bottom of the seventh frame scoring three runs, the deficit was too much to overcome and it lost to Santa Barbara 11-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB saw great performances from mostly every player that took part in the game whether it be on the mound or on the plate. All its starters collected at least one hit and only one did not score a run. It was a dominant performance all around yet then again so was the whole tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did a great job of bouncing back after its first loss of the season. Instead of sulking they went out and outscored their three weekend opponents by a score of 36-9. Many, if not all, players had great tournament performances highlighted by Bush’s MVP and Clarks All-Tournament Honoree play.</p>\n<p>This confidence-boosting weekend could not have come at a better time as now UCSB must turn its sights to one of their toughest opponents on its schedule this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is Tuesday, March 1<sup>st</sup> against No. 21 UCLA at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The game against St. Mary’s could have been about fatigue considering it was the Gauchos fifth game in five days.</p>\n<p>“Five games in five days was tough for our team.” Checketts said “This three game series will go much better.”</p>\n<p>Now coming into the weekend with a solid three-day rest, Santa Barbara should be able to show the same intensity it showed in its first series of the season. It will also be interesting to see if the young team will be able to overcome early adversity.</p>\n<p>“We are going to respond the right way. That loss was not the end of the world.” Redshirt junior Andrew Calica said. “This team is young and motivated, we will be ready.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are led by redshirt sophomore J.J Muno who leads the team in hits with eight and RBI with six. The young second baseman has been the most consistent Gaucho having at least one hit in every game this season. Calica also comes in hot hitting 7-14 in his last four games.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also found out it can count on redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover. In Tuesday’s outing he hit 3-5 and batted in a runner. He currently leads the team in batting average with a .429 BA.</p>\n<p>Another interesting thing to keep note of this weekend will be the line-up changes made by coach Checketts. In all five games this season only Calica has stayed in the same batting position as the lead-off hitter, the rest have all been moved to see what line-up works best.</p>\n<p>“We still got a lot of moving parts.” Checketts said. “As we get further into the season we will get more answers but for now we just want to see guys play their way into the line-up.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is slated to start Shane Bieber against the Wildcats. The junior won his first game of the season after pitching seven solid innings allowing seven hits and two runs while also striking out four. Against UK last year, Bieber pitched eight innings allowing only one run and nine hits.</p>\n<p>“As a group we need to throw more strikes and be more aggressive.” Checketts said. “I’d like to see Bieber, Nelson, Garcia, Davis all do good.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face a Kentucky team that is coming off a 15-run, 20-hit, seven homerun performance in its last outing against Dayton. Early in the year, the Wildcats are sporting the highest slugging percentage (.728) and most home runs (10) to start a season in school history.</p>\n<p>UK is led by junior Javon Shelby. Shelby leads UK and the SEC with a .667 batting average to start to the year, with six of his eight hits going for extra bases, adding six runs, two homers and three RBI.</p>\n<p>Another strong hitter for Kentucky is freshman Tristan Pompey who is second on the team in batting average with a .500 BA. The SEC freshman of the opening week of the season also leads the team in homeruns with three.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be facing right-hander Zach Brown who is currently 0-1 with a 9.82 ERA. The junior had a tough opening day start against Wofford allowing nine hits and three runs in just 3.2 innings of work. His second opponent won’t be any easier as the Gauchos are batting a solid .353 as a team this season.</p>\n<p>If UCSB is able to pull off the win Friday, then it will face the winner of Bryant University and San Diego State. Bryant seems to be one of the most formidable opponents in this tournament as they are the only undefeated team.</p>\n<p>If it wins both games, Santa Barbara will then go into the championship round and play either Arizona, Nebraska, Tulane and/or University of San Diego.</p>\n<p>“This is going to be a good tournament; we can’t underestimate anybody.” Calica said. “We have to come out with the fire we had on opening weekend.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Friday, February 26<sup>th</sup> at 1 p.m. in San Diego, California for the Tony Gwynn Classic against Kentucky at Tony Gwynn Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Gauchos came into the contest hot offensively, however, they were only able to muster one run in the first six innings of the game. Instead, it was St. Mary’s who got off to a hot start scoring two runs in the first inning.</p>\n<p>“I think our energy was low early on.” Junior outfielder Andrew Calica said. “We gave away some early at-bats and you just can’t do that.”</p>\n<p>Junior catcher Nate Nolan started the scoring for the Gaels by batting in two runners, sophomore infielder Zach Kirtley and redshirt freshman outfielder Edward Haus, off a single turned into a double by a fielding error.</p>\n<p>The score would remain 2-0 in favor of St. Mary’s until the fifth inning when J.J. Muno continued his hot start to the season by hitting an RBI single bringing in fellow teammate, freshman outfielder, Michael McAdoo.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara then took the a 4-2 lead in the seventh inning with a solid three-run inning highlighted by sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier’s RBI double, redshirt sophomore catcher Grover Dempsey’s RBI single and sophomore shortstop Clay Fisher’s RBI single.</p>\n<p>After the seventh inning, it looked as though the young UCSB baseball team had regained momentum and was going to maintain its perfect start, however, the Gaels had other plans.</p>\n<p>“We definitely had some momentum after that seventh [inning],” Calica said. “and then to see it get away from us hurts.”</p>\n<p>The eighth inning was a rough one for pitcher Trevor Bettencourt. The redshirt junior was credited with his first loss of the season after allowing all five runs scored by the Gaels that inning.</p>\n<p>“We had good guys in at the right time.” Checketts said. “Sometimes you just don’t execute and its just not your day.”</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s began the inning with the top of its line-up going off as the first five batters got on base. Junior catcher Nate Nolan, sophomore outfielder Joey Fiske, freshman infielder Connor Thane and Haus were all credited with an RBI. The Gauchos could not overcome the 7-4 deficit which led to their eventual loss.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos did lose the game, more credit has to be given to the Gaels for taking the game. They got great performances from Nolan who went 3 for 5 with a double and three RBI and Haus who went 3 for 4 with a double, stolen base and an RBI.</p>\n<p>Although they suffered a tough loss, the Gauchos still have things they should be proud of. The team showed resiliency coming back from a sluggish start and a lot of their young players still proved to have solid outings. Grover went 3 for 5 with an RBI, Muno had another extra base hit and they even got good pitching early on.</p>\n<p>“We bounced back after a tough first couple of innings and we saw some great things, we just have to finish next time.” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Sophomore left-hander Kyle Nelson pitched a great game in the three innings he was in allowing no hits, no runs and at one point had five consecutive strikeouts. However, he played so much in the series against USF that the Gauchos could not afford to pitch him longer.</p>\n<p>“Kyle threw a bunch on the weekend,” Checketts said. “that’s as far as he could’ve gone.”</p>\n<p>All in all, Santa Barbara was never expected to win every game this season. No team is expected to go perfect, however, it will be interesting to see how this young team can respond to its first adversity.</p>\n<p>“I think we are a young team with a lot of fire.” Calica said. “We will come back with some new fire and energy this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game will be Friday, February 26<sup>th</sup> at 1 p.m. in San Diego, California for the Tony Gwynn Classic against Kentucky at Tony Gwynn Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Gauchos saw some great offensive fireworks this past weekend scoring 34 runs, 48 hits, four homers and a solid .353 batting average in their series against the Dons.</p>\n<p>“As a team I thought we saw the ball really well.” Plantier said. “We were aggressive and it was nice to see we could swing it well more than people think.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s hitting this year is led by redshirt sophomore J.J Muno who leads the team in hits with seven and is tied for first in homeruns with one. The second baseman also leads the team and is tied for third in the Big West conference in RBI’s with five.</p>\n<p>“In general he [Muno] is like our energizer bunny.” Checketts said. “He is one of the most vocal guys on the team and he is a strong leader.”</p>\n<p>Another strong hitter for the Gauchos is redshirt junior Andrew Calica. The center fielder is second on the team in on-base percentage with .579 and fourth in batting average with .429. Calica also leads the team and is tied for first in the Big West conference in stolen bases with two.</p>\n<p>“I love being the lead-off hitter for our team.” Calica said. “I’m glad these guys trust me and I just want to set the momentum off right every time.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also saw a solid pitching performances from redshirt sophomore left-hander Joe Record. Record only allowed three hits and one run in seven innings pitched in his first start of the season. He is third on the team in strikeouts with five and leads the team in ERA with a solid 1.29.</p>\n<p>“We got a little bit of work to do on the mound but we saw some good things that we can build off of.” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be facing a very good team today that is capable of hitting the ball. Sophomore outfielder Joey Fiske leads St. Mary’s in both batting average with .429 and hits with 6. Helping out the Fiske is another fellow sophomore Zach Kirtley. The infielder leads the team in RBI’s with five and slugging percentage with a .667.</p>\n<p>The Gaels also have a solid pitching staff led by junior left-handed pitcher Johnny York who pitched eight innings on Saturday without allowing a single run and only four hits. He also leads the team in strikeouts with seven.</p>\n<p>“We just have to take each game one at a time.” Calica said. “We will be ready for St. Mary’s just like we will be ready for every team we face this season.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shocked a lot of people with their outstanding play this last weekend. Only returning two starters, UCSB has a bunch of new faces, however, these new faces did great to start and now fans are excited to see if they can keep playing well.</p>\n<p>“I think we have some talent a lot of people don’t know about.” Plantier said. “It’s a coming out party for us and we just want to prove people wrong.”</p>\n<p>UCSB looks to extend its winning streak to five Tuesday, February 22 at 2 p.m. against St. Mary’s at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In the fifth inning a sac fly by sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier and a big two-RBI single by redshirt sophomore outfielder Josh Adams gave them a solid 5-1 lead after five innings.</p>\n<p>The game was sealed in the seventh inning when Adams hit a big two-run homer to give his team a 7-1 lead. UCSB gave up two runs in the ninth inning, however, it still hung on and won the game 7-3. Redshirt sophomore Joe Record had a great outing on Sunday on allowing three hits and one run with five strikeouts in seven innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“Our guys did a good job.” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We did a great job on the mound, Joe [record] had a solid game.”</p>\n<p>Before Santa Barbara achieved the sweep, it first had to play a doubleheader, something that is tough for any team. However, the Gauchos had a fast start in the late game that made it a bit easier for them.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out firing offensively scoring three runs in the first inning. After two Dons runs in the second inning, the Gauchos responded by scoring two runs of their own, including a great homerun by Calica, and maintaining a three run lead at 5-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s most effective inning came in the bottom of the fourth when it scored six runs and took a solid 11-2 lead. It eventually won the game 13-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offensive prowess was highlighted by all nine hitters recording at least one hit and the team having 19 hits as a whole. Calica’s 3-5 day, which included the aforementioned homerun, and sophomore Clay Fisher four singles were notable performances in UCSB’s great offensive day.</p>\n<p>In the earlier game, Santa Barbara had an early scare when they found themselves down 5-1 heading in the bottom of the sixth inning. The Dons offense was led by junior outfielder Harrison Bruce who went 2-4 with 3 RBI and junior Dan James who hit the first homerun of the season for the Dons in the second inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos comeback effort began in the sixth inning when Plantier started the three-run rally with a single. Four of the next six UCSB batters got hits which led to the three runs that cut the Dons lead to just one.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara completed its comeback in the eighth inning when junior outfielder Devon Gradford hit a sac fly that put two runners in scoring position. Senior third baseman Ryan Clark batted the two runners and give his team a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>The Dons tried to put together an effort in the final inning, however, the offense dried out as sophomore Kyle Nelson pitched a 1-2-3 inning to seal the victory for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Before UCSB played a brutal doubleheader, in its season opener redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno had the game of his life to lead his team that day. The second baseman had a solid hitting day going 3-5 with 4 RBI and came just a single shy of hitting the cycle.</p>\n<p>“I was floating out there for a while.” Muno said. “I had no idea what was going on it was amazing.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos season started hot with three scores in the first inning which began with Muno’s double. Plantier batted in his second baseman with a single and redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover hit in two more runners later in the inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB allowed one run at the top of the second but Muno hit a two-RBI triple that gave his team a 5-1 lead. The sophomore’s homerun in the fourth inning gave the Gauchos a commanding 7-1 lead.</p>\n<p>After taking a 7-1 lead, Santa Barbara gave up one run but also added one to win the game 8-2 and start the season off the right way, with a win.</p>\n<p>“We were pretty solid defensively.” Checketts said. “We did a lot of good things and got a good lead early.”</p>\n<p>Right-handed pitcher Shane Beiber had a solid outing going seven innings deep and only allowing two runs. The junior also had four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“I thought our guys on the mound did a great job.” Checketts said. “Beiber was in character and threw some solid strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos perfect start to the season is a great sign of things to come. The young team seemed poise to battle and showed fans new players that seem as though they will contribute a lot to this team.</p>\n<p>“There was so much offensive production,” Checketts said. “I was happy with performances from guys like Clark, Muno. Clark in particular hits in the nine-hole and when your ninth batter bats .450 that’s a good sign.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday at 2 p.m. against St. Mary’s at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The preseason polls have UCSB finishing fourth in conference play behind LBSU, UC Irvine and No. 16 Cal State Fullerton.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Checketts, entering his fifth season as the Santa Barbara Head Coach, will have a much tougher time setting his line-up this season. This is because a record 10 of his players were drafted last year, including pitcher Dillon Tate, who was drafted fourth overall by the Texas Rangers. UCSB has the second-most draftees of any team in the country, only trailing Oklahoma’s 11 players drafted.</p>\n<p>“There has been a lot of turnover on the roster,” Checketts said. “However, we are returning some key pieces.”</p>\n<p>These key pieces include outfielder Andrew Calica and pitcher Shane Bieber. Calica is a career .321 hitter at the Division I level, while Bieber earned an All-Big West Second Team nod after co-leading the Big West in wins with 8 and a solid 2.24 ERA.</p>\n<p>“I’m counting on them [Calica and Beiber],” Checketts said. “They’re Friday night starters and have experience, including playing in regionals last year.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are also going to count on younger pieces such as sophomores Clay Fisher and Kyle Nelson. Fisher, an infielder, racked up 43 hits and 19 RBI’s, which were both seventh best on the team. Nelson, a left-handed pitcher, went 3-1 with a 0.75 ERA out of the bullpen to earn Freshman All-America honors.</p>\n<p>“We are new in some spots and we are excited for the younger players,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to see its new roster do some good things against a San Francisco squad who finished 23-31 last season. They ended the season on a seven game losing streak, meaning they will be excited to take the field against UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Dons are looking to players like infielder Dan James to lead the team this year. The junior had a .346 batting average, which was second best on the team. They will also look to former 2014 West Coast Conference All-Freshman Team Nico Giarratano. The junior hit a respectable .220 average in his 32 games.</p>\n<p>The new Santa Barbara line-up is what will have most people excited this season. After losing the aforementioned 10 players to the draft, it will be interesting to see how new players feel in their roles.</p>\n<p>“We still have a lot of question marks,” Checketts said. “There are still a lot of moving parts and we still are not sure of our exact lineup. We want to find ourselves and our identity, and it will take some time, but we are excited.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s season opener is at 2 p.m. Friday, Feb. 19 against San Francisco at Caeser Uyesaka stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 18, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

That is why we root so hard for these incredible stories. And there is no doubt that Eric Berry and the 2015-2016 Kansas City Chiefs are that underdog this year in the NFL.</p>\n<p>On October 12, 2015 Chief fans—and my fantasy football team—were crushed by the devastating news the star running back Jamaal Charles was out for the season with a torn ACL. Six days later Kansas City lost its week six match-up against the Vikings dropping its record to 1-5.</p>\n<p>At the time, their chances of making the playoffs was zero percent. Hope seemed gone, analysts said they were done, fans were hoping for a high draft pick and management was hoping they would get to keep their jobs. That’s when safety Eric Berry stepped up.</p>\n<p>Berry knows all about overcoming adversity. In 2011, after a solid rookie campaign, the former Tennessee safety tore his ACL and was out for the season. He ultimately came back in 2012 and continued his great play and became recognized as one of the best young safeties.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in late 2014 tragedy struck Berry again, but this time much worse, as he was diagnosed with Lymphoma. Once again, he fought back. “Fear nothing, attack everything.” This is what Berry said right after he beat cancer less than a year later. He was playing by the second week of the regular season.</p>\n<p>Just like Berry, The Chiefs chose to fight for what they truly wanted, a playoff spot and a chance to win their first Super Bowl since 1969. By the end of week 16, that dream came true. After defeating the Browns on December 27th, Kansas City secured the fifth seed in the AFC.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs have rallied off 10 straight victories and are a team that everybody would like to avoid. They are giving up 13.2 points per game since week 5 something that has only been accomplished five times the turn of the century, of which two of those teams made it to the conference championship.</p>\n<p>Another reason for the great defensive play is the emergence of rookie Marcus Peters. In 2014, the Chiefs defense combined for six interceptions on the season. In 2015, Peters had eight interceptions by himself.</p>\n<p>It also helps that Quarterback Alex Smith is playing the best football of his career this year. He has already set career highs in yards and advanced metrics like Total QBR. And even without its star RB, Kansas City still ranks 6th in the NFL in rushing behind Charcandrick West.</p>\n<p>Analysts make the case that the reason for the Chiefs rise is the fact that their schedule got easier after week 7. Since then, the combined records of the 10 teams Kansas City has played is 67-91. However, it should be noted that this is the NFL, no game is an “easy” win. The Chiefs had to win 10 straight games, a feat that only on two other NFL teams accomplished therefore implying this isn’t something that happens everyday.</p>\n<p>I’ll repeat that by week six Kansas City had a zero percent chance of making the playoffs and were 300:1 odds in Vegas to make the Super Bowl. Fast forward to today and the Chiefs are in the playoffs with now 14:1 odds to make the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I am wrong for assuming most teams would’ve given up once your record falls to 1-5 in the NFL and that most fans were already ready for the next season. However, when your team leader is a man who overcame a devastating illness that kills millions of people each year, how could you ever possibly justify giving up on him and on the season?</p>\n<p>The Chiefs did something that has only been done once in NFL history and that is make the playoffs after starting the season 1-5 or worse. Eric Berry did something that, unfortunately, many people cannot do, and that is beat cancer. Both underdogs will be looking to end the long 22-year drought without a playoff win that has plagued Kansas City and its fans.</p>\n<p>Something tells me this is the year that its going to happen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

After two disappointing performances to open the tournament, it was clear Santa Barbara was determined to establish their offensive attack early.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the first frame, sophomore attacker Shane Hauschild scored with a medium range shot followed by a beautiful corner shot from freshman driver Boris Jovanovic, putting the Gauchos up 2-0.</p>\n<p>It was a highly contested defensive match in the second quarter with both teams not scoring until Hauschild added his second goal with just over two minutes to give UCSB a 3-0 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>The 49ers managed to respond in the second half, scoring the first two goals to open the third to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to one goal.</p>\n<p>Jovanovic stopped the run, netting his second goal of the contest while Hauschild completed a hat trick just before the end of the third to make the score 5-3 in favor of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The final frame started with a score from junior attacker Mitchell Hamilton and LBSU countering back the very next possession. Senior attacker Derek Shoemaker added a goal to make the score 7-4 with just over four minutes left.</p>\n<p>Although the game seemed like it was going to be easily won by UCSB, the 49ers did not go away easily, adding two goals to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 7-6 with just over one minute left. In its final possession, LBSU missed the shot and the clock ran out giving the Gauchos the victory and the seventh-place finish.</p>\n<p>Before ending on a high note, Santa Barbara lost to a team ranked lower than itself for the first time this season after a poor performance against UCI. It had beaten the Anteaters earlier in the season thanks to a game-winning shot. However, UCI was able to avoid the intense ending in Saturday’s match.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ star senior driver Lovre Milos started the scoring by making a goal three seconds into the start of the match. UCSB responded by scoring two goals courtesy of Shoemaker but gave up two scores to the Anteaters as they took the 3-2 lead after the first.</p>\n<p>Shoemaker and Hamilton added two goals for UCSB in the second quarter to give it a 4-3 halftime lead. However, in the second half the team fell apart, surrendering five-straight goals.</p>\n<p>Within a span of thirty seconds into the third quarter, the Anteaters scored three goals to go up 6-4. They would add one more in the fourth to win the game 7-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ four goals tied a season-low. It would be in back-to-back matches they tied their season-low, having happened first in their quarterfinal matchup against Cal.</p>\n<p>The Bears scored two goals in the first quarter to take an early lead. UCSB’s lone goal in the first half came late in the second period thanks to Shoemaker. After his score, the Gauchos surrendered three-straight goals, going down 6-1 at halftime.</p>\n<p>Cal added two more goals to start the third and took a commanding 8-1 lead. With the quarter nearing the end, Shoemaker added one more goal to make the score 8-2 after three quarters.</p>\n<p>Shoemaker completed a hat trick in the fourth period, scoring his third score of the game. Hauschild also added a goal but the outcome was inevitable. The Gauchos lost 11-4, diminishing their hopes of winning their first MPSF championship in school history.</p>\n<p>Still, the two seniors that led Santa Barbara throughout the season put on good performances to end their careers as Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge tallied 40 saves on the weekend, ending his career with 895 saves, the second most in MPSF history. Shoemaker had six goals in the three games and finished the season as the Gauchos leading scorer with 48.</p>\n<p>Although the final weekend did not go the way UCSB intended it to go, it still had a solid season overall. The 16-11 finish was an improvement from the year before and overall, the team looked competitive in almost every match.</p>\n<p>The losses of the four seniors will have an impact, but the Gauchos still have plenty of young talent such as Hauschild, Jovanovic and Hamilton returning. The exposure that these young players gained from playing this season along with the growth of the rest of the team makes UCSB a considerable contender to emerge for a top finish in next year’s MPSF standings.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Cal, the third seed in the tournament, has won five of its last six matches and holds a 21-5 record finishing MPSF play with a 7-2 record. The Golden Bears are seeking their first MPSF championship since 2006.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The quarterfinal match this Friday will be the fourth meeting between these two teams this season. The Bears have defeated the Gauchos in the last three matches by scores of: 12-5, 12-5 and 12-8.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been going over the last three matches on film.” Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge said. “We are really confident we can win.”</p>\n<p>In the last matchup at Campus Pool, UCSB had a chance to pull off the upset against then No. 4 Cal when they were tied 8-8 after the third. In the final frame, Santa Barbara was held scoreless and gave up four goals in its third loss to Cal this season.</p>\n<p>“We improved in each game we played them this year.” Wigo said. “The last game was our best performance, went tied into the third. I think we can do that again and this time we will finish.”</p>\n<p>The Golden Bears are led by two top-10 MPSF scorers in freshman attacker Johnny Hooper and freshman utility Odysseas Masmanidis. Hooper is the third leading scorer in MPSF with 65 goals while Masmanidis ranks seventh with 56 goals this season. The two freshman have combined for 15 goals against the Gauchos this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB must also be weary of Colin Mulcahy, the Sept. 7 KAP7/MPSF Player of the Week recipient. The senior attacker has scored 47 goals on the season, third most on the team, including a five goal performance this past weekend against Stanford. He has accounted for five goals in three matches against Santa Barbara this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to be ready defensively.” Wigo said. “They are a tough team and they are talented.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Golden Bears are led by junior goalkeeper Lazar Andric who has tallied 210 saves this season and has an impressive 10.2 saves per game. He holds the fourth highest saves total in a single match this season when he has 19 against Pacific on Oct. 10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will want another big performance from star senior Derek Shoemaker who has been on a hot streak recently with seven goals in the last two matches. The attacker leads the team with 42 goals.</p>\n<p>Right behind him is sophomore Shane Hauschild who has 35 goals on the season, good for second on the team. Other key factors are freshman Boris Jovanovic who has 26 goals this year and junior attacker Mitchell Hamilton who has scored at least two goals in the last two matches.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the pool, UCSB knows it has one of the best goalkeepers in MPSF history, senior Chris Whitelegge. Whitelegge is currently at 850 career saves which is only five saves from the No. 3 spot and 39 saves from No. 2. However, Whitelegge has struggled against Cal allowing 12 goals in each of the last three matches.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Gauchos will go as far as their star seniors take them. The seniors have played a big role all season whether it be offensively, defensively or in the leadership roles. Intensity will also be a big key to the game, as UCSB will need to take the game to Cal instead of the other way around. Most importantly, the intensity needs to last four quarters to in order to pull off the upset.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face off against Cal in the quarterfinals of the MPSF Tournament on Friday, Nov. 20 at USC’s Uytengsu Aquatic Center at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

As the sixth seed, UCSB will have a rematch against No. 2 Cal, who secured its third seed with a victory over No. 5 Stanford.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With much at stake, the Gauchos responded by putting on one of their better performances this season. Although they started off a bit sluggish, an onslaught of 13 goals in the second-half helped propel them to a win in the final game of the regular season.</p>\n<p>The match started with the Waves going up 1-0 after scoring on their first possession. Shoemaker answered back for UCSB, scoring back-to-back goals to give it a 2-1 lead at the end of the first quarter. Once the Gauchos took the lead, they contained it for the game’s entirety.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened up the second period with a goal from junior attacker Mitchell Hamilton. Shoemaker completed a hat trick with just under a minute left in the frame and gave his team a 4-1 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine commenced the second half with another strong score, but was countered when sophomore attacker Shane Hauschild scored a deep goal to keep the UCSB lead at a margin of three.</p>\n<p>Senior two-meters Liam Gaughan and Nick Jordan extended the lead with goals of their own, making the score 7-2. UCSB would add three more goals to its total while only surrendering one score to take a commanding 10-3 lead in the final frame.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter consisted of a lot of scoring by both teams, but with no doubt of who the winner would be. The Gauchos outscored the Waves 7-5 in the fourth and won 17-8. Scorers in the final frame included Jordan, Hauschild, freshman driver Boris Jovanovic, junior utility Tor Jenson and junior two-meter Anthony Buljan.</p>\n<p>Along with the impressive victory, UCSB also set a new season-high for points in a game coincidentally just one week after it had set its previous season-high. Santa Barbara also set a season-high for points in a half, doubling its previous mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end the season on a high note with a two-game winning streak and a nine loss season, their lowest total since 2008. They also end the season with a winning road record of 4-2 for the first time since 2013.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCSB improved upon its underwhelming performance in MPSF play last year in which it did not win a single game. This year, Santa Barbara won four conference games and finished with a winning overall record, something it hadn’t accomplished since 2013.</p>\n<p>While each accomplishment is a sign of progression after a frustrating conference finish last year, the Gauchos season is far from over. Their match against Cal will be the fourth meeting between the two squads. The Bears have won each of the previous three matches this season.</p>\n<p>Defeating Pepperdine was a great way to end the regular season, but the real season has only just begun for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face-off against Cal in the quarterfinals of the MPSF Tournament on Friday, Nov. 20<sup>th</sup> at USC’s Uytengsu Aquatics Center at 1:00 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Moving away is always a difficult thing to do. No matter the age, moving away from the people you made bonds with and the places you grew attached to is something that most would like to avoid.</p>\n<p>Sometimes though, moving away to a new place is the only option to keep on doing what they love. This is true about UCSB’s own Mitchell Hamilton, a junior sociology major who had to leave his dream school to come to Santa Barbara and continue doing what he loves most: playing water polo. It is a decision he certainly has come to love and embrace.</p>\n<p>Hamilton grew up loving water polo. He was a star polo player in high school, leading his team to four league championships. He was also honored with achievements such as First Team All-America and First Team All CCS. However, he says he owes all his success to his mother, the person who encouraged him to play such a demanding sport.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I started playing water polo when I was in seventh grade,” Hamilton said. “My mom was the one who pushed me into water polo and I really owe a lot to her.”</p>\n<p>Being the great high school player that he was, Hamilton had many options to continue his playing career. Ultimately he settled on Cal, a school he admired growing up, not only for its academics, but also its consistently good water polo program.</p>\n<p>Hamilton seemed to have made the right choice at the time. As a freshman, he scored 16 goals for the Golden Bears and was a key player on the team. Cal eventually made it to the MPSF Championship against USC before losing the match 9-5. Still, as a freshman Hamilton played a big role, scoring two goals in that game, a good sign for the future.</p>\n<p>As a sophomore, Hamilton again registered 16 goals along with 15 assists. Once again he was a big factor on the team even though it didn’t make a run as deep as the year before.</p>\n<p>“I loved Cal. The players were great.” Hamilton said. “I liked the competiveness that went on in practice. I felt like everybody was really fighting for a spot to travel every practice.”</p>\n<p>Although Hamilton showed great promise and had a great two years at Cal, something always bothered him. He kept on having troubles with the coaching staff. The issues got so bad that he decided to leave the water polo program after his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>“After a while I didn’t see eye-to-eye with the coach, which is why I left the program.” Hamilton said. “I didn’t want to play for him anymore. It was a tough personal choice.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton now was faced with the toughest choice of his young adult life; to return to Cal without ever playing water polo again or leave the school he loved. He decided to take a semester away from school to really think about what he wanted, working as a math tutor and caterer in the meantime.</p>\n<p>“It was actually really fun,” Hamilton said happily. “It was nice to make some money and just take time off. My family was also very supportive, something I am thankful for.”</p>\n<p>While Hamilton was deciding his next step during the 2014-2015 campaign, the UCSB water polo program was suffering its worst season ever. The Gauchos finished 11-15, winless in conference play, and finished seventh place in the MPSF championships.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Wolf Wigo knew his roster was more than talented to make a better run next year but he also knew getting a player like Hamilton wouldn’t hurt. The two were almost meant for each other. Hamilton needed a new start and Wigo needed another attacker to replace Eric Van de Mortel, who graduated after last season as one of UCSB’s top offensive players.</p>\n<p>“When Wolf reached out and contacted me, he really highlighted the great opportunities I would have at UCSB,” Hamilton said. “And the guys on the team are all a bunch of winners, which are the type of people I like hanging out with.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Hamilton was swayed and decided to come play his remaining two years of eligibility at Santa Barbara, a decision that has been beneficial for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>Since coming here, Hamilton has set new career highs in both goals scored and steals with 21 and 18 respectively. He has also become a team leader and is a guy that the whole locker room respects.</p>\n<p>“My new career highs are cool but I’m not worried about that,” Hamilton said. “I’m just really happy to be on such a great water polo team and contributing to wins.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton’s modesty is admirable; however, his head coach knows that he is a big factor on this team and is happy that he decided to join.</p>\n<p>“He’s the fastest guy on this team,” Wigo said. “He helps with the counter-attack and he’s a great player enjoying a great season. He’s also a guy that works everyday as hard as he can and sets a good example for the younger guys. I’m really proud of him.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton is not just a hit with the coaching staff, but also with the players. He is a great locker room guy that the players love being around. This is no more apparent than with seniors Derek Shoemaker and Chris Whitelegge.</p>\n<p>“He plays a huge role on this team and his shot is deadly,” Shoemaker said. “He’s my roommate and I love hanging with him. He’s a great influence and he’s been a great teammate.”</p>\n<p>“He’s just such a skilled player.” Whitelegge added. “I remember playing against him when he was at Cal and he was good then, I’m glad he plays for us now. He’s great to be around and his positive energy constantly rubs off on the team.”</p>\n<p>With the seniors departing soon as the season is coming to an end, Hamilton will be the new face of UCSB water polo, something that he has earned with his great play and something he hopes to keep living up to.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, leaving Cal was very hard, but it seems to have paid off for Hamilton. He has been able to be a factor on a team that has been very welcoming of him and he has come to love the atmosphere of Santa Barbara in general.</p>\n<p>“I love the ocean, and the girls are beautiful here,” Hamilton jokingly said. “I just really love it here and I love this team. I love being back on a team with a bunch of great dudes, playing a game I love. SB is beautiful and everybody seems like they are happy to be here.”</p>\n<p>Leaving is certainly a tough thing to do, but sometimes in the end, it is worth it. It has worked out for Mitch Hamilton and it has most definitely worked out for anyone associated with UCSB water polo. Thank you, Cal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of November 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Pepperdine hosts UCSB with an overall record of 11-12 and is currently 1-6 in conference play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If Pepperdine beats UCI on Friday and goes on to beat Santa Barbara by at least two goals, then they will have a good chance of taking the tiebreaker and the sixth seed, making this a crucial game for both teams.</p>\n<p>“We are in a really great position.” Senior attacker Derek Shoemaker said. “We feel confident we can get that win and have a good standing for the MPSF tournament.”</p>\n<p>These two teams are no strangers, as Saturday’s game will mark the third matchup between them this season. UCSB has been the victor in both meetings, but not by much.</p>\n<p>At the NorCal Tournament in September, the Gauchos narrowly defeated the Waves by just one goal in overtime. The two teams met again at Pepperdine just four days later, during which UCSB again came away with a slim victory, this time by two goals.</p>\n<p>“Pepperdine will be tough.” Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge said. “We’ve won two games against them already so they will be extra fired up to get one against us.”</p>\n<p>No doubt Pepperdine will put up a great fight, as it has in the last two matchups, thanks to freshman Marko Asic. The young utility leads the team in goals scored with 37.</p>\n<p>Alongside him is senior attacker Wesley Sherburne, who has 33 goals, three of which he scored against UCSB in the teams’ second matchup. Sophomore goalkeeper Zack Rhodes has also played a key role with his 228 saves on the season.</p>\n<p>As the final week approaches, Santa Barbara knows it will be able to count on its four star seniors to lead it to victory. Senior two-meter Liam Gaughan has done big things against the Waves, scoring five goals against them this season. Two-meter Nick Jordan will look to continue with his timely shooting and maintain his shooting percentage of 42.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos get help from a lot of players, but the two stars who have led the team all season are (don’t add year and position for these names) Derek Shoemaker and Chris Whitelegge. The team’s leading goal scorer with 39, Shoemaker has scored seven goals against Pepperdine this year.</p>\n<p>As for the star goalkeeper, Whitelegge will look to keep moving up in the MPSF record books in career saves. He has played exceptionally well against Pepperdine, registering 28 saves in the two matchups, including a season high 15 in the second match alone.</p>\n<p>“They like to shoot,” Whitelegge said. “They are going to fire away and really try to take the game to us. We have to stand against that.”</p>\n<p>The final regular season match will have huge significance for the No. 6 team in the country. The Gauchos are in control of their own destiny at this point, a position that every team hopes to be in this late in the season.</p>\n<p>“This is where we want to be.” Wigo said. “This was one of the goals coming into the season and we are there now, we just have to play well and everything will work itself out.”</p>\n<p>It will be an emotional match for both teams, as a handful of seniors will be playing their final regular season game. The stakes are high with the No. 6 seed in the MPSF Tournament on the line, as seeds 7-10 will have to play a tie-in game to advance to the next round.</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and Pepperdine will show why they will be forces to be reckoned with as the MPSF championships quickly approach.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ final regular season match will be played on Saturday at Pepperdine at 12 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
