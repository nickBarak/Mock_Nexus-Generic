Army at home and a loss at Southeastern Louisiana earlier in the week.</p>\n<p>Both squads have no experience as of late in terms of having faced off, but the two teams almost met last year in the Tony Gwynn Classic. Had Tulane defeated UC San Diego, then it would have played Santa Barbara in the championship of the inaugural classic, which UCSB won.</p>\n<p>Another interesting tidbit is that the Green Waves actually defeated the Wildcats in that same tournament last season.</p>\n<p>That Arizona squad is the same one that went on to knock Santa Barbara off the College World Series, and went on to play for the College World Series championship before losing to eventual champion Coastal Carolina in three games.</p>\n<p>Experience was something the Gauchos expected they would be able to rely on heading into this season, as opposed to last year, but that has not been the case through four matches. In fact, UCSB looks like a completely different squad from a year ago after displaying many offensive struggles against Loyola Marymount and Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>Two players that were key components of the CWS squad, redshirt junior J.J. Muno and junior Austin Bush, have struggled mightily thus far. The redshirt junior and true junior have combined to bat 1-29 at the plate this year and striked out a total of 12 times in 29 at-bats.</p>\n<p>Last year, Muno had the best batting average on the team in players that had at least 140 at-bats after tallying 68 hits on 231 at-bats (.294), of which 18 were extra-base hits and five were home runs.</p>\n<p>This year, the second baseman has yet to register a hit in 14 at-bats. While he has managed to drive in two runs, the struggles are certainly concerning seeing how big a role Muno played a season ago.</p>\n<p>Bush’s struggles are on par with Muno’s as he is currently 1-15 on the season and has struck out a team-high seven times. The designated hitter is known to strike out a lot, as he proved last season with 60 strikeouts, the second-highest mark in the Big West; however, his game is predicated on his ability to hit the ball out of the park, something he did a lot with 11 homers, a league best as no other player registered double-digit home runs.</p>\n<p>Despite this, one veteran who has continued to excel into the new year is junior Clay Fisher.</p>\n<p>The shortstop currently ranks third on the team in batting average (.333) and is tied for first in both hits (5) and home runs (1). Fisher’s defensive presence is something that has garnered national attention since his acrobatic plays that made Sportscenter, which the Gauchos will also continue to rely on, as he has converted on three double-play opportunities.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">ICYMI… RT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNU\">@ESPNU</a>: Is that Clay Fisher or Derek Jeter? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCSB_Baseball\">@UCSB_Baseball</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCAACWS\">@NCAACWS</a></p>\n<p>Watch LIVE: <a href=\"https://t.co/0dEzqJ5k9I\">https://t.co/0dEzqJ5k9I</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oqCbK61Ug3\">pic.twitter.com/oqCbK61Ug3</a></p>\n<p>— Big West Baseball (@BigWestBaseball) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BigWestBaseball/status/738873869310758912\">June 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>UCSB will also hope to continue get great play from newcomers Colton Burns and Landon Silver. Burns, a junior college transfer, presently owns the best mark on the team in batting average (.385) and slugging percentage (.615). Freshman outfielder Silver has also been a welcomed addition, slashing .375/.444/.375 in three games played.</p>\n<p>Pitching on the mound Friday will be sophomore Noah Davis, who put forth a spectacular start last week, which saw him earn his and the team’s first win of the year. Against LMU, the right-hander went six innings allowing only four hits, one earned run and one walk alongside four strikeouts on 74 pitches.</p>\n<p>Sunday probable starter Joe Record will look to remedy a disappointing effort against Loyola, in which he only managed 3.2 innings allowing four runs, three of which were earned runs.</p>\n<p>Junior Kyle Nelson turned heads on Saturday as he started the game. Primarily known as a reliever, the left-hander went four innings in his first start of the year, allowing five hits and one earned run which, unfortunately, was enough to hand him the loss.</p>\n<p>The decision to start Nelson going forward will be interesting considering that, before the season, he was named the No. 6 reliever in the country by D1Baseball and was included on the NCBWA Stopper of the Year Watch List for the second time in his career.</p>\n<p>For Tulane, taking a series from a serious contender for making the NCAA regionals again would be a huge boost in turning around this season and looking more like the team from a year ago that made it as far as the Oxford Regional.</p>\n<p>Aiming to defend its AAC championship, the Green Waves will primarily rely on senior Hunter Williams, who currently holds the team’s best batting average after going 7-16 (.438) through the first four games. The infielder is also a threat with the long ball, as he already has two homers and is currently holding a slugging percentage .875.</p>\n<p>Senior Corey Merrill will also be a tough play on Friday. The right-handed pitcher had a solid first outing pitching seven innings and allowing only six hits, two earned runs en route to a victory.</p>\n<p>Despite the slow start, this certainly does not entail a bad season for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Four games is hardly a sample size worth noting when deciding to write a team off, especially when one factors that Santa Barbara’s most effective players have had early season struggles.</p>\n<p>Once those are corrected, who’s to say what could happen?</p>\n<p>To put things into perspective, current No. 15 Arizona started last year 2-3 before getting back on track and going on to have a spectacular season, finishing 38-20 on the year and making its college world series appearance. Point being, UCSB has plenty of time to get things in gear, but getting started sooner rather than later would be ideal.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins a three-game series with Tulane at 2 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 24, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium with Saturday and Sunday’s games taking place at the same location and beginning at 2 p.m. and 1 p.m., respectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Catcher/infielder Jake Ortega then turned loose on a 1-0 pitch count and doubled down the left field line scoring a run and extending the lead to 2-0. The sophomore finished the night 1-3 with the lone RBI. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although allowing two runs in the second, Clements was nearly unhittable the rest of the way allowing only two hits. However, the junior picked up his first loss of the season after 5.1 innings pitched, allowing six hits, two earned runs, two walks and only registering one strikeout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moten, a sophomore who had been solid all day, began to struggle as the eighth progressed. After freshman outfielder Landon Silver took a walk, junior shortstop Clay Fisher singled to left putting runners on first and second with no outs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a sac bunt advancing the runners a base, Moten was relieved by Dewsnap ending a solid afternoon’s work. The right-hander finished the evening after 7.1 innings allowing only three hits and one earned run while registering nine strikeouts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to the plate was junior utility Colton Burns who continued his hot start to the season with a single right up the middle scoring Silver and putting Fisher, the tying run, at third with only one out. Burns finished the day 2-2 with a RBI.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this very advantageous position, the Gauchos failed to capitalize as junior designated hitter Austin Bush could not muster a hit or even a sac fly as he struck out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two outs, J.J. Muno still had a chance to tie the game, but the redshirt junior continues to struggle as he flew out to left field and was unable to score the tying run. The second baseman finished the night 0-4 and is still hitless on the season through four games as he is 0-14. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting out of the tough jam, Dewsnap was able to finish off the Gauchos in the ninth securing the victory for Moten and earning his first save of the season. The junior finished allowing only one hit and striking out two batters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the season first began last week, especially after an opening day victory, no one could’ve expected the offensive struggles that are currently plaguing UCSB. However, with the season still in its early stages, there is no need to press a panic button yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, now that the Gauchos are coming home, maybe the offensive struggles can be corrected behind the roar of a great Gaucho crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara faces off against Tulane at Caesar Uyeska Stadium beginning Friday, Feb. 24, at 2 p.m. for a three-game series this weekend.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

dropped from the national rankings after losing two of three at LMU, but will look to bounce back versus Cal State Bakersfield tonight.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After dropping its first series of the new campaign by losing two of three at Loyola Marymount, the UCSB baseball team will look to rebound in a quick one-game series at Cal State Bakersfield in order to hopefully move its way back into the national rankings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is going to be a sense of urgency out of the guys leading into this,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “Hopefully we have better approaches offensively and defensively.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara heads into their fourth road match of the season with a 1-2 overall record, a much different start than last year when it started 4-0 before losing its first game. CSUB hosts the visiting Gauchos with an identical 1-2 record after losing two of three to Utah at home.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

However, the rest of the weekend was a bit of a struggle for the shortstop, as he only went 2-7 in the final two games. He currently still leads the team in batting average (.364), RBI (3), on-base percentage (.462) and slugging percentage (.727).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also need better outings from veterans J.J. Muno and Austin Bush. Muno, a redshirt junior, went 0-10 on the weekend but did manage two RBIs. Bush, a junior, only mustered one hit in his 11 at-bats and drove in a run, but he struck out five times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Colton Burns was a pleasant surprise on the weekend, and hopefully, he can sustain his confident play. The utility player homered in the opening game against LMU and batted a solid .273 over the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most likely starting today for the Gauchos on the mound will be junior Chris Clements. If he plays, it would be the right-hander’s first action of the season. As a sophomore, he made seven appearances and two starts only mustering a 10.13 ERA over 13.1 innings pitched with 13 strikeouts and eight walks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The junior will need to be on his A-game today as there are some solid hitters in the Bakersfield lineup. Senior Ryan Grotjohn batted .636 over the weekend after going 7-11 against Utah and also drove in one run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow senior Max Carter and junior Andrew Penner also had a solid opening weekend series as both earned five hits a piece and batted .455 and .417, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite not having named a starter, CSUB will be a tough outing for the Gauchos as they have solid arms in the pen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season, the two teams split their two-game series with the road team being the victor in each outing. The Gauchos scored 10 runs in a win but only four runs in the loss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is only one game, this game certainly feels like a must-win for this Gaucho team. It is not a make or break moment, but it would be great to see this team overcome some early season adversity after the high expectations placed on them this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB faces off against CSUB at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 21, at Hardt Field.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

finish in its last invitational, the UCSB golf team was able to secure a first-place finish out of the 12 competing teams at the PRO Compression Invite on Tuesday for its second tournament title this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara won the tournament at The Farms Golf Club in Rancho Santa Fe by finishing 12 under par 852, a whole nine shots better than second place Wichita State who carded 3-under par 861. These two squads were the only ones that were able to finish under par once the tournament had come to a close.</p>\n<p>The tournament victory marked the Gauchos’ first since carding an amazing 31 under par 833, tying the course record, in the fall at the Bill Cullum Invitational.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB was led by junior Zach Smith and freshman Brett Bennett, who both were the highest ranking individual Gauchos, finishing tied for third after both carding 6-under par 210.</p>\n<p>Although he had another solid tournament, Smith again had the chance to have the highest individual score at the tournament after entering the final round 10 under par.

showing at the Folino Invitational just a few weeks ago, the UCSB golf team will be back in action this week at the Pro Compression Invitational at The Farms Golf Club, which will take place on Monday, Feb. 13, and Tuesday, Feb. 14, both days beginning play at 8 a.m.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be in action against three other Big West foes in this tournament, as they will take on UC Riverside, UC Irvine and Cal Poly. At the Folino Invitational, Santa Barbara finished in second place out of 10 teams and placed higher than UCI, who finished in third, and UCR, who finished in sixth.</p>\n<p>In its last outing, UCSB certainly looked like a really solid team and had many opportunities to defeat Long Beach State and end up getting first in the entire invitational. The squad finished with a final tally of a 10-over par 874 and only a two-point difference in its loss against LBSU, who finished 8-over par 874.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior Zach Smith was a key component in the Gauchos’ high finish and will look to continue being a force as an individual golfer as well. At the Folino Invitational, Smith was bested by Long Beach State’s Joe Fryer, putting him in second place; however, the former 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year played a solid outing finishing 2-under par 214.</p>\n<p>“Outstanding tournament, a hard course and finishing two under par is outstanding. But he hit a quadruple-bogey on the 12th hole and missed his opportunity to win the individual,” Head Coach Steve Lass said.</p>\n<p>At the Farms Golf Club, UCSB will expect to play Smith, freshman Brett Bennett, junior Brandon Bauman, junior Willy Moffly and sophomore Tyler See. Bennett, Bauman and Moffly all finished in the top 10 individually, with Bennett finishing the highest tied for seventh.</p>\n<p>Monday’s invitational will be no joke, as the Farms Golf Club located in Rancho Santa Fe is one of the hardest courses to play on. The course begins with easy holes; however, the difficulty definitely varies as players go on. It spans 7211 yards and has a total par of 72.</p>\n<p>“This will be the most difficult course we will play in all year,” Lass said. “But it can definitely help us grow, and I think we will play well.”</p>\n<p>Notching a second-place finish in its first tournament of the new year was definitely a nice way to start 2017, but Coach Lass knows this team still has its kinks to work out if it wants to take home the Big West championship this year.</p>\n<p>“We are one of the top teams in the Big West. On any given day we are as good as anyone and I like our chances, but we do have to minimize our mistakes,” Lass said.</p>\n<p>UCSB golf begins the Pro Compression/Folino Invitational at 8 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 13, at the Farms Golf Club.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It has been a rough year for the UCSB men’s basketball team, and it got even worse on Friday. For the first time since the 2013-14 season, the Gauchos will be without star junior guard Gabe Vincent in their starting lineup for the rest of the season, and possibly beyond, after he suffered a torn ACL in their home loss to CSUF on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss, Santa Barbara still has a game on Saturday and will host UC Davis with a substandard 3-17 overall record and a 1-7 Big West record. For the Aggies, this matchup could not come at a better time after suffering a loss to then league-worst Cal Poly on Thursday, which dropped them to second place in the Big West standings, 13-9 overall, and 5-2 in the conference.</p>\n<p>In case it was not obvious already, the big storyline for UCSB will be how will they replace the production of Vincent, who has been a consistent force since his freshman year. This season, Vincent was the team’s leading scorer and the Big West’s fifth leading scorer averaging 14.8 points per game. Before this injury, the junior had only missed five games in his two-plus years in a Gaucho uniform.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Replacing the former Big West Freshman of the Year and a 2016 Honorable Mention All-Big West recipient will not be an easy task, but it will be a necessary one if the Gauchos hope to make the Big West tournament for the first time after the conference expanded to more than eight teams in the 2007-08 season.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned Cal Poly win not only dropped UC Davis out of first place, but it also put the Gauchos at dead last in the conference. This means that if the Big West tourney were to start today, UCSB would not be in it, thus ending its season despite having defeated the Mustangs for its only conference victory.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Eric Childress is a proven solid point guard, good for scoring 8-10 points on a given night as well as dropping four or more dimes and possibly coming up with a bevy of steals. However, that will not be enough if he cannot have one of the young players step up to help him on both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s young athletes range in experience. Sophomore forward Maxwell Kupchak played well in Thursday’s loss, scoring 10 points on 4-6 shooting but will need to be tougher on the glass. Sophomore forward J.D. Slajchert a pure hustle player and very important asset, but he will need to be more consistent with his mid-range jumper in order to help the Gauchos’ 346th-ranked field percentage in the country.</p>\n<p>Freshman guards Christian Terrell, Max Heidegger and Clifton Powell Jr. have all shown tremendous promise, but that potential needs to show up now if the Gauchos want to win ball games.</p>\n<p>In reality, this season has always been about that. Vincent and Childress were not going to be able to carry this team to the postseason themselves; they need the young players to help them. With the losses of Ami Lakoju, Jalen Canty, Jarriesse Blackmon and now Vincent, that truth become all the more real.</p>\n<p>Facing UC Davis will be no easy task, as the Aggies crushed UCSB at Davis 73-47 earlier this year. Not to mention, the Aggies also have one of the best new players in the Big West this year in Chima Moneke, who ranks first in rebounds and third in scoring in the conference with 8.7 RPG and 16.0 PPG.</p>\n<p>Even with that, Saturday’s match will tell one thing: how the Gauchos will respond to this type of adversity. Losing anyone to injury is hard, and it only gets harder when that person is as efficient as Vincent, but the season goes on. Santa Barbara has faced some tough setbacks all year, quite possibly more than any other team in this conference, but a berth in the Big West tourney would be a great accomplishment given all it has suffered through.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces UC Davis at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 4, at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

I mean, it wouldn’t be the Patriots as we know them without the most unexpected rookies, forgotten vets and other brushed-off players emerging year after year.</p>\n<p>While there’s no pinpointing Belichick’s “system,” his leadership and oftentimes disliked quirkiness has set him apart from the rest of the league.</p>\n<p>New England has become the league’s juggernaut that can never be counted out. The dynasty’s foundation has always been a storyline with tones of a franchise rebuilt from the ground up.</p>\n<p>This Sunday, their Super Bowl 51 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons is no different; the Patriots make their league-record ninth Super Bowl appearance in hopes of winning their fifth Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p>Both Belichick and Brady are currently in their 17th season with the Patriots organization. The opportunity to further cement themselves as the greatest to ever grace the sideline and field in NFL history is in full effect this Sunday.</p>\n<p>Belichick and Brady are the only coach and player ever to each achieve seven Super Bowl appearances. Thus far, they have been members of all four of the franchise’s Super Bowl-winning teams.</p>\n<p>The all-time leader in postseason wins by a quarterback with 24, Brady has the opportunity to become the first quarterback in NFL history to win five Super Bowls.</p>\n<p>While many are anticipating “Tom’s Revenge” after he endured a four-game suspension and witnessing Commissioner Roger Goodell hand Brady the Lombardi Trophy as an apology for the temporary ban, there seem to be more personal things at stake.</p>\n<p>For a quarterback who believes he could play until the age of 45, Brady has bigger concerns than Commissioner Goodell.</p>\n<p>Despite once again being in the MVP conversation after posting regular season numbers of 3,554 passing yards, 28 passing touchdowns, an 112.2 passer rating and just two interceptions, I think it’s safe to say Brady is ready to provide the final verdict of himself as the greatest QB ever.</p>\n<p>I’m sure you’re thinking, “Well, hasn’t he already established that?” However, it’s as if we’ve become so accustomed to Brady’s greatness that admiration for his consistency has gradually diminished.</p>\n<p>Yes, he is still elite. His legacy is further enhanced as a four-time Super Bowl champion and current two-time NFL MVP. Even still, these accomplishments have not been enough for those who doubt Brady’s placement amongst the best.</p>\n<p>From “Spygate” to “Deflategate” or even the argument that he has only attained his greatness because of Belichick’s coaching system, Brady still has something to prove.</p>\n<p>Whether or not a win on Sunday will curtail any of the criticisms Brady receives is unpredictable, but it’s certain that it will take more than Brady if a shootout takes place against the leader of the NFL’s top scoring offense in the Falcons’ quarterback Matt Ryan.</p>\n<p>Although the team’s player-coach duo has received the majority of the praise for its success year after year, the most integral role heading into Super Bowl LI is the Patriots’ receiving core.</p>\n<p>Brady’s ability to produce despite the lack of a true No. 1 receiver over the years is constantly glorified. Aside from Randy Moss’s stint with the Patriots from 2007-2009 and a return in 2010, New England has had few noteworthy receivers but has still managed to be one of the league’s top offenses each season.</p>\n<p>Via <em>sportingcharts.com</em>, since 2009 the New England Patriots have ranked in the top 10 of Team Yards After Catch (YAC) totals in six of the last eight seasons, including back-to-back No. 1 finishes in 2011 and 2012.</p>\n<p>This season, the Patriots ended the regular season third with a YAC total of 2,334, just 48 yards shorter than Atlanta’s second-place finish.</p>\n<p>Despite having just one 1,000 yard receiver in Julian Edelman, whose current total of 84 career postseason receptions is nine away from No. 2 all-time per <em>espn.com</em>, the Patriots’ receiving core was still a nightmare matchup for a majority of teams this season.</p>\n<p>While the season-ending injury to tight end Rob Gronkowski was detrimental to its offense, New England’s bevy of receiving options in Chris Hogan, Malcolm Mitchell, Danny Amendola, Martellus Bennett and even running back James White has exposed defenses.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Falcons, there’s no one Patriot receiver to key in on, as each is versatile enough to line up in the slot or wide out near the sideline. Hogan, for example, is coming off a career performance after a record-setting 180 receiving yards on nine catches for two touchdowns in the team’s blowout AFC title win over Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>As long as the Pats can protect Brady and give him the ample amount of time in the pocket, it could be a field day for New England’s receivers. They will be facing an Atlanta defense that didn’t fare well against the pass during the regular season, allowing the fifth-most passing yards per game and passing touchdowns at a 266.7 average and a total of 31, which was five less than the league-high allowance of 36.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, I initially didn’t approach this piece with the belief that the Patriots would win this Sunday. Although my heart still resides with the underdog Atlanta, I am left somewhat undecided because of the unpredictability the tandem of Brady and Belichick presents.</p>\n<p>Whether it be Atlanta winning its first Super Bowl in franchise history or New England and Brady earning its fifth, history will be made to the benefit of not just football, but the culture of sports.</p>\n<p><strong>Atlanta Falcons by Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>Rooting for the underdog is definitely not new to a whole lot of people, especially in sports. This year is no different, as countless fans and non-fans alike will be rooting for the underdog Atlanta Falcons.</p>\n<p>Newcomers to the biggest stage the game has to offer — considering their last, and only, Super Bowl appearance was in 1999 —the Falcons will certainly need to accommodate to the spotlight quickly if they have any shot of beating the league’s greatest dynasty, the New England Patriots.</p>\n<p>Looking back to the beginning of the season, no one could have possibly predicted that this team from the NFC South would be representing its respective side of the conference come February. ESPN’s Vaughn McClure had them missing the playoffs with a 7-9 overall record, while Heath Evans and Elliott Harrison of the NFL Network projected the Falcons to finish the regular season with only five wins.</p>\n<p>Having already proven the experts wrong just by making it to the Super Bowl, the Falcons want to take the ultimate step and win the whole thing.</p>\n<p>To go one step even further, who could have predicted that 10 years after the scandal of the once promising Michael Vick hurt the city of Atlanta — not to mention the cowardly departure of former Head Coach Bobby Petrino — that the Falcons would be one win away from hoisting the Lombardi trophy.</p>\n<p>Despite great moves by team owner Arthur Blank in the hiring of coaches and GMs throughout the last few years, no decision was a better one than the drafting of Matt Ryan. In a lot of ways, Ryan and Atlanta are very deserving of each other, especially in a game of this magnitude, as they both know the feeling of being the underdog.</p>\n<p>Drafted to replace Vick two years after Vick’s scandal, Ryan was expected to have great success right away for Atlanta. Although he enjoyed much success early in his career, his allure never reached the stature of the once promising Vick. The city never embraced him quite as tight as they did No. 7.</p>\n<p>The fact is many experts pegged Ryan as someone who would go down as a solid NFL quarterback, but not one that will win multiple, if even one championship. As the years progressed and his play seemed to flat line, this prediction seemed as though it would become true.</p>\n<p>The nine-year quarterback responded with easily the best season of his career, as he passed for career highs in both passing yards (4,944) and touchdowns (38) while throwing a career-low seven interceptions. Using all the weapons he has at his disposal, Ryan did not waste a single snap this year.</p>\n<p>Now, Atlanta and Ryan go hand-in-hand and the two seem to feed off each other in many ways. For the Falcons, Ryan might be the first truly great quarterback to bring them a championship, while Ryan has found a home in Atlanta and seems to love playing there as much as anyone else ever has.</p>\n<p>10 years ago, no one could have expected the Falcons to make such a quick recovery. After being blown out at home by the Packers in the 2011 Divisional Round, no one could have expected Matt Ryan to be the quarterback to lead the Falcons to the promise land. These two underdogs really do deserve each other come Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Falcons organization is truly becoming one of the greats in the NFL, and it started with the drafting of a 23-year-old quarterback from Boston College.</p>\n<p>Despite the MVP play from Ryan, Atlanta has made plenty of other tremendous decisions that have allowed them to enjoy the luxury of playing on the final Sunday of the NFL season. The drafting of star players like Julio Jones, Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman, among others brought a new light back to Atlanta, and that has it set up for greatness.</p>\n<p>For those wondering if the Falcons Super Bowl run was just a fluke, you should consider the fact that Atlanta went 11-5 this season against the NFL’s toughest schedule in the league based on prior year’s record and won its division, easily going 5-1 with its only loss coming in week one to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>\n<p>Once more, the Falcons held down one of the best offenses in the entire league, ranking second in total yards and passing yards per game. They possessed the fifth best rushing attack at 120.5 rushing yards per game and owned the league’s highest scoring offense, averaging 33.8 points per game; no other team even averaged more than 30 points per game this year.</p>\n<p>Winners of their last six ball games, including playoffs, the Falcons are certainly coming in as a team that caught fire at the right time. Over its last six victories, Atlanta has averaged a total of 39 points per game, a league high over that span, while only surrendering 19.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>The playoffs have been a breeze for the Dirty Birds as well, as they rolled over both the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers at home, defeating them by an average of 19.5 points in each of those games.</p>\n<p>I mean, just looking at the numbers; Ryan and the Falcons seem poised to be the next champions of the football world, proving themselves much more than underdogs.</p>\n<p>When the playoffs first started, it was safe to assume the Falcons didn’t have many experts picking them to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl. Now that they are here, experts are flocking toward the experienced Patriots to defeat them despite having been proved wrong all season. What’s one more game, Falcons?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 2nd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Losers of its last three games, the Gauchos’ main focus in this game will be to try to pick up a much-needed victory in order to move up the conference ladder; they currently sit in eighth place, one game in front of 0-5 Cal Poly.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75153\" style=\"width: 381px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75153\" data-attachment-id=\"75153\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/gauchos-host-csun-in-crucial-big-west-match/jd-slajchert-makes-a-fast-break-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-14-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"JD Slajchert makes a fast break.

The defending Big West champs in both the regular season and the conference tournament have only mustered an 8-11 overall record and a below average 2-4 conference record. However, being the home team might work in its favor, as Hawaii is currently 8-7 at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As for the Gauchos, they are coming off yet another disappointing performance as Cal State Northridge beat them handily at home last night, 78-57. The loss marked the ninth time this season that they lost by double figures, and the sixth time this season they were held to 60 points or less in a game.</p>\n<p>If Santa Barbara hopes to come back from Hawaii with a win under its belt, then it will need to improve upon its league-worst points per game (63.5), shooting percentage (36.8), three-point percentage (26.1) and free throw percentage (65.1).</p>\n<p>Since conference play has started, UCSB has been even worse in every single one of those categories besides free throw percentage and ranks dead last in PPG (59.2), shooting percentage (36.1) and three-point percentage (24.3). In fact, the Gauchos three-point percentage ranks dead last in the entire NCAA DI Basketball once you factor in their poor 5-21 shooting against CSUN yesterday.</p>\n<p>One thing UCSB has been able to count on this season is low turnover numbers. Santa Barbara ranks second in turnovers per game with a low 11.9. It has also been solid on the glass as it ranks second in the Big West in rebounds per game grabbing 39.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Considering that the Gauchos are down two big men in sophomore forward Ami Lakoju and junior forward Jalen Canty, the fact that the rebounding numbers have been able to stay up is a testament to how hard the team plays every night.</p>\n<p>However, playing hard simply is not enough, and if UCSB wants to start winning these conference games and make a run at the Big West tournament, it will need to start making shots.</p>\n<p>One athlete who is certainly gifted at scoring is guard Gabe Vincent. The former Big West Freshman of the Year is third in the Big West in points per game, averaging 15.4.</p>\n<p>The junior had a great first half last night against CSUN, going off for 16 points on a very efficient 6-12 shooting, 4-6 from beyond the arc. Unfortunately for Vincent, fatigue and the Matadors defense seemed to catch up to him as he went scoreless in the second half on 0-7 shooting from the field and 0-4 from the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Someone will definitely need to help Vincent on the scoring end if the Gauchos want a happy result on Saturday, and besides relying on senior Eric Childress, they will also need great performances from two big freshmen in Clifton Powell Jr. and Max Heidegger. As the stats suggest, when Vincent and Childress get help from the young athletes, Santa Barbara’s chances of winning go way up.</p>\n<p>Powell is a spark plug for the UCSB offense, and when he is running and scoring, the team certainly feels like it is flowing a lot better. The guard was a big factor in Santa Barbara’s 58-53 win over Cal Poly as he went off for a career-high 13 points and scored on two clutch threes.</p>\n<p>Heidegger is another guard who has also been a bit inconsistent but has shown flashes of brilliance. The freshman was the second-leading scorer last night for the Gauchos with 12 points and averages 7.6 PPG, which is the fourth-best on the team. His career high of 21 points came on UCSB’s huge comeback victory over CSUB back on Dec. 27, and he followed that game up with a 17-point night versus Seattle.</p>\n<p>Desperation time is now for the Gauchos. With only a one game lead on the eighth spot and the last spot for the conference tournament in March, they need to start racking up some wins to keep the Mustangs away. Despite the awful start to the season, getting to the Big West tournament should be the No. 1 priority for the Gauchos, and who knows, maybe when that time comes, they will be able to make a run.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against Hawaii in a Big West match at 8 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 28 at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 27, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Days after putting forth one of its most impressive offensive performances this season in a loss at Long Beach State, the UCSB men’s basketball team hoped to display the same prowess at UC Riverside in order to achieve its first road win of the season.</p>\n<p>Although junior guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Eric Childress kept the Gauchos in the game for most of it, especially in the first half, fatigue caught up with them and the rest of the team, sending them back home with a 65-55 loss to the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>The 10-point loss drops Santa Barbara to 3-14 overall, matching its loss total from last season during which it finished 19-14. It also falls to 1-4 in the Big West and is now eighth place in the conference standings. UCR improves to 5-11 overall and, more importantly, is now over .500 in the Big West at 3-2, placing them in third place in the standings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saturday’s loss at Riverside was yet another example of what the Gauchos are struggling with the most this season: making open shots from both beyond and inside the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot only 30.5 percent (18-59) from the field. Compare that to UCR’s 45.5 percent (25-55) from the field and it’s no shock as to why the home team won the matchup. Even with winning the rebounding battle at 41-36 and shooting much better from the free-throw line, Santa Barbara as a team was not as efficient from the field as UC Riverside, resulting in its eighth road loss of the year.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders were leading for most of the first half behind the great play of senior guard Malik Thames, who had nine points on 4-5 shooting. Luckily for the Gauchos, Vincent was also clutch in the first half with 11 points, including two three-pointers and scoring his 1,000th career point in his career as a Gaucho, becoming only the 28th player in school history to accomplish this feat.</p>\n<p>With the score tied at 25 with only 1:20 left in the first frame, Childress knocked down two FT’s to give his team a 27-25 lead. However, Santa Barbara then conceded seven straight points before the end of the half, including three by Thames, to go down 32-27 at the break.</p>\n<p>After retaking the lead late in the first half, the Highlanders never looked back, keeping the score in their favor until the end of the match. In stretches during which it played good defense, UCSB was unable to knock down a shot to really cut into the lead and threaten UCR. In the second half, Santa Barbara shot only 28.1 percent from the field while UC Riverside shot 48.1 percent. UCSB was able to stay in the game due to its ability to get to the line, where it shot 9-12 in the half.</p>\n<p>The last great chance the Gauchos had to make this a game was with 6:44 left in the contest. After two made free-throws by junior forward Alex Hart making the score 53-47, UCSB forced a turnover and had three solid looks at cutting the lead to four, its lowest margin since early in the second half, but were unable to capitalize. UCR scored on the next possession and finished the Gauchos off 65-55.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 55-point night was the second lowest point total of the season, with its worst being a loss at UC Davis 73-47. UCSB seems to be its own worst enemy in nights like these, forcing shots that are not there while also missing open shots that should result in points.</p>\n<p>Despite solid first-half performances, Childress only managed two second-half points, while Vincent did put up a solid seven but on a very inefficient 3-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>This season has been very tough for the Gauchos, but with over 10 games left in Big West play, they cannot afford to give up just yet. This UCSB team has shown flashes of greatness in its win over Cal Poly and even in some tough losses like at LBSU.</p>\n<p>With a team that has such potential and still has the third leading scorer in the conference in Vincent, this team is capable of making a run; it just needs a bit of a push.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is against CSUN at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 25 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Despite UCSB holding a 51-35 advantage all-time over UCI, the two teams have certainly been evenly matched over the past four years, splitting their last eight match-ups.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are the hotter team coming into this match, as they are winners of their last four ball games in which they averaged 82.2 points per game and outscored their opponents 329-223.</p>\n<p>As a team, UC Irvine’s stats rank among some of the best in the Big West in different categories, proving it is a team that can excel in all facets of the game, as it is second in the league in blocks per game (3.8), third in rebounds per game (39.2) and fourth in assists per game (13.2).</p>\n<p>Irvine’s scoring leader this season has been senior guard Jaron Martin who scores the sixth-most points per game in the conference, averaging 14 a game. On the rebounding side, sophomore forward Jonathan Galloway who ranks third in the Big West — second if you exclude UCSB’s junior forward Jalen Canty who is out indefinitely due to academic ineligibility — averaging 6.4 boards per game.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the court, UCSB ranks among the bottom in many of the major categories in the Big West. This season, the Gauchos are eighth place in the conference in points per game (64.2), steals (5.0) and rank dead last in field goal percentage (36.7), three-point percentage (27.8) and free-throw percentage (61.4). In fact, Santa Barbara’s field goal percentage and three-point percentage rank 344 out of the 347 teams in Division I College Basketball, while its free-throw percentage ranks 341st.</p>\n<p>One of the two stats that which the Gauchos rank near the top in is rebounds per game. They are currently second in the Big West in that category averaging 39.4 boards as a team, but with the losses of their two best big man down low, Canty, and sophomore forward Ami Lakoju, to academic ineligibility, one could only surmise that they will not fare well much longer.</p>\n<p>If UCSB has any hope tonight, then it will need a big game from junior guard Gabe Vincent. The former Big West Freshman of the Year is the team’s leading scorer and the Big West’s second-best scorer averaging 15.8 points per game. In five home games this season, Vincent has done significantly better from three-point range, shooting 36 percent from the field as opposed to 27.7 away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Guard Max Heidegger would also be a welcomed addition. The true freshman has been a bit inconsistent this season but has certainly shown flashes of greatness, scoring 21 points in an overtime home victory against Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>With a lackluster start comes huge scrutiny, and no one is facing more of Head Coach Bob Williams. Many fans have taken to social media to show their distaste for Williams after such a bad start to the season.</p>\n<p>However, winning changes all fortunes and a huge victory against UC Irvine tonight would be a huge step in the right direction for everyone involved with this program.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UC Irvine at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 12 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

And in some cases, a fresh start is exactly what some teams need now that conference play has come to the forefront of the action. With championship bragging rights and a NCAA invitation bid on the line, these nine Big West foes will be battling all season in order to prove they are the better team, at least for this year. Whether Hawaii will repeat as champs, or another squad will dethrone them, one thing is for sure, these conference match-ups will be some of the most intense basketball these teams have faced all season. With that being said the Daily Nexus Sports Staff presents a preview of each Big West squad, enjoy! <strong><em>Note: With the exception of UCSB, who was ranked No. 4, the rest of the teams are ordered from first to last according to the Big West media preseason polls. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Barbara – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>The 2016-17 campaign has not been off to an ideal start for the UCSB men’s basketball team, which currently sits at 2-11 overall and 0-1 in the Big West after a blowout loss at UC Davis last Wednesday 73-47. However, one could only hope that now that conference play is in full effect, the Gauchos can look to turn around their tough start to the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara has two big pieces that could help change the fortune of the season in guards Eric Childress and Gabe Vincent. Vincent, a junior, is currently second in the Big West in points per game with 15.8, while Childress, the team’s only senior, ranks third in the conference in assists 3.7.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they have lost two of their best big men down low in forwards Ami Lakoju and Jalen Canty. Canty, a junior transfer, was supposed to be a big force on the rebounding side of things, and he was ranking first on the team, grabbing seven boards per game, but he has been ruled out indefinitely due to academics. The same goes for Lakoju, who was leading the team in field goal percentage with a solid 61.2.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be against UC Irvine at the Thunderdome tonight at 7 p.m. in what could be a turnaround game for it as a squad.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>What stood as a promising yet empty-handed conclusion last season for Long Beach State, experiencing a narrow 107-102 loss to Washington in the first round of the NIT, has only added fuel to the fire and makes for a hungrier 49er squad.</p>\n<p>With nine returners possessing much experience, Head Coach Dan Monson looks to build on his team’s 20-15 record and heartbreaking 64-60 Big West Championship loss to UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>After a rigorous non-conference schedule, facing off against three of the top-10 AP ranked teams, the Beach stands at 6-12 overall and 1-1 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Similar to last year, the 49ers’ rough preseason schedule will likely be beneficial for them in their journey to the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>An even more jam-packed schedule this year compared to last could enable his team to get over the hump and make it to its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2012.</p>\n<p>The trio of junior forward Gabe Levin, junior guard Evan Payne, and junior guard Justin Bibbins have been the focal points for the 49ers’ offense.</p>\n<p>As two Preseason All-Conference selections this year, Bibbins and Levin have taken over the reins of former senior and scoring standout Nick Faust, combining for 22.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>Payne, a redshirt transfer from Loyola Marymount, has blossomed into his starting role starting 12 of the last 15 games for the Beach and averaging a team-high 14.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>Long Beach will face off against UC Riverside this Saturday, Jan. 14 at 4 p.m. The game will be aired live on ESPN3.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Will Bodendorfer</strong></p>\n<p>UC Irvine men’s basketball team and Head Coach Russell Turner, who is in his seventh year at the helm, are coming off an impressive 2016 season in which the team won a school record 28 games.</p>\n<p>The team returned just one starter from last season in senior guard Luke Nelson. Among the four starters to leave was 7’6” phenomenon center Mamadou N’Diaye whose tough defensive presence has been hard to replace.</p>\n<p>After opening the season ranked second in the Big West preseason poll, UC Irvine ended with a disappointing 5-9 non-conference record.</p>\n<p>Despite their slow start, the Anteaters have recently been able to right the ship, winning their last four games and boasting a perfect 2-0 conference record. UCI’s most recent victory came in a commanding 84-56 drudging of defending Big West Champions Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Jaron Martin has been the team’s standout player thus far, leading the team in both scoring (14.0 PPG) and assists (3.2 APG). After coming off the bench last year, Martin has solidified himself as a starter in Turner’s lineup during the 2017 campaign.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine’s next game will be a Big West conference matchup at UC Santa Barbara tonight, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to conference play, CSUN was at a subpar 4-9 by the end of its non-conference schedule. However, the Matadors now stand at 6-9 after their 2-0 start to Big West play as they are in a three-team tie for first place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Led by Head Coach Reggie Theus, the former NBA All-Star, and NCAA All-American is now in his fourth year at the head position. He and the Matadors will look to continue their winning ways as the regular season progresses.</p>\n<p>Northridge is powered by four Matadors who rank as some of the top individual offensive leaders in the conference.</p>\n<p>Ranking third in points per game in the Big West (15.5) is redshirt junior guard Kendall Smith. Complementing Smith is junior forward Tavrion Dawson. The Matadors’ big man ranks fourth in field goal percentage, boasting an impressive 56.8 percentage.</p>\n<p>Lastly, two Matadors top the three-point percentage rankings. At first place is junior guard Michael Warren with a 51.9 percentage. Meanwhile, redshirt junior guard Darin Johnson barely trails at a 50.0 percentage. Both sit comfortably as the only two Big West athletes that average a 50 or above percentage.</p>\n<p>It is evident that the experienced juniors are leading this team through their current streak. It will depend on their aptitude and willingness to get their younger teammates involved in order for the basketball program to continue thriving as it has been throughout the early stages of conference play.</p>\n<p>CSUN will be away from home once again this week, as it will look to extend its streak against Long Beach State this Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Tommy Pardini</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis men’s basketball team came away from its nonconference schedule with the most wins in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Ending nonconference play with at 8-7, the Aggies’ record includes an undefeated 5-0 record at home. UC Davis also ranks third in the conference in RPI – a stat that measures a team’s strength of schedule and how they perform against that schedule.</p>\n<p>The Aggies are an experienced bunch-backed by standout junior forward Chima Moneke and senior guard Brynton Lemar, who are both top 10 in points per game among Big West players, each averaging 14 per contest. Moneke ranks first in both double-doubles and rebounds per game among Big West players.</p>\n<p>The last time the Aggies had a winning record going into conference play, they won the Big West regular-season title in 2015. The preseason media poll had the Aggies finishing in fifth place in the conference, but based on their performance thus far, they look like they are ready to possibly prove the polls wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – DJ Ruvalcava</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Fullerton men’s basketball team posted a 7 – 8 record in non-conference play and currently has a 1-1 record in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Tre’ Coggins is averaging a Big West-leading 18.6 points per game and is accounting for almost 25 percent of the team’s offense. The Titans are relying on him and his supporting cast to propel them through the rest of their tough Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>With four seniors, four juniors and a large freshman class consisting of seven first-year players, the Titans are relying heavily on their mixture of youth and experience this conference season.</p>\n<p>By having preseason all-conference guards Coggins and sophomore guard Khalil Ahmad, the Titans look to finish conference play with a much better record than their dismal 2015-16 season in which they went 3-13 in conference and underperformed expectations.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Dedrique Taylor and his team hope to improve on a recent surge, during which they won three out of their last four games before eventually falling to Cal State Northridge Saturday in a close finish of 70-65.</p>\n<p>Despite their 7 -8- record, the Titans are hopeful of their chances in conference play as they boast a 7-2 home record with eight of their last 14 games being played in Titan Gym.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton looks to build on their recent success against Cal Poly at Mott Athletics Center this Thursday, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>UC Riverside dropped eight of its final nine games to end the 2015-16 season, and the Highlanders appear to have been unable to overcome their slump in the 2016-17 campaign, where they now stand at 2-11 overall and 0-2 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCR began its season with two wins in four games by a combined 82 points, suggesting that a bright future was on the horizon for the belabored squad. Instead, the Highlanders have now lost nine of 10 and sit at the bottom of the Big West standings as one of four teams without a conference win.</p>\n<p>Forced to rely heavily on its young talent with just three seniors on its roster, Riverside’s trio of senior forward Secean Johnson, redshirt junior guard Chance Murray, and senior guard Gentrey Thomas has been the biggest positive.</p>\n<p>The three combine for 32.3 points per game, with each individual averaging double-digit points per contest, while also being the Highlanders’ three most prolific rebounders.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have been woefully bad on the road this season, going winless in nine games. With four of the next six games at home, however, there is hope UC Riverside will be able to end its drought and mount a competitive comeback in the conference season.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>Despite winning both the Big West regular season title and the Big West Conference Tournament crown just last year, the Hawaii men’s basketball team is expected to finish in eighth place in the Big West this season in the annual media preseason poll due to the loss of four perennial starters.</p>\n<p>Last year was a big year for the Rainbow Warriors, finishing the year 28-6 overall. However, part of the reason for the lack of excitement surrounding this years’ team is due to the fact that even their one returning starter, senior forward Mike Thomas, is redshirting this year after having to undergo wrist surgery this offseason.</p>\n<p>Because of Thomas’s absence, Hawaii is only returning a total production of just 66 points, 41 rebounds and 22 assists from last year’s team and has been a huge factor in the team being only 6-9 overall and 0-2 in the Big West to this point.</p>\n<p>While this year might turn out to be a wash, the Rainbow Warriors still have a bright future after adding five high school recruits and four CC transfers this offseason. In fact, junior transfer forward Gibson Johnson has already made an impact for Hawaii this season, averaging 10.8 points per game, a team-high and 4.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii will most likely not be able to defend both its regular season and conference tournament crown from a year ago, the pieces are in place to make a much more successful run in the 2017-18 season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s men’s basketball team began the season on the right foot, establishing itself as a well-organized unit heading into Big West play. However, the Mustangs have struggled through the toughest part of their schedule and sit at 5-10 overall and 0-1 in the Big West after a close loss in their first conference matchup at UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Losses to key players at a crucial time in the season seem to be, unfortunately, following one after another due to injuries and transfers. True sophomore guard Jaylen Shead — who recently decided to leave Poly at the end of the fall quarter — the team’s assist leader with 5.2 per game, is going to be a hard loss to deal with as league play continues. Shead started all nine games he played before transferring, and the promising guard is yet to declare his next school after leading the Big West in helpers.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/JaylenShead/status/811288013225558019</p>\n<p>Junior forward Josh Martin, who was second for the ’Stangs with 10.4 points per game — behind redshirt senior guard Kyle Toth who leads the squad with 11.4 PPG — has experienced the biggest loss since his injury five games into the new season. Still, he has been at work on the boards with 8.4 RPG, nearly double the second-highest on the team.</p>\n<p>In the annual Big West media preseason poll, Cal Poly was projected to finish in last place in the conference standings at seasons end, and due to some unfortunate setbacks, the projection will most likely come to fruition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Part of the reason for Santa Barbara’s early woes is the fact that they have faced some very tough opponents. In fact, UCSB’s non-conference strength of schedule ranks 20<sup>th</sup> in the nation according to ESPN’s latest poll, the highest of any Big West team, with fellow conference counterpart Long Beach State sitting only five slots behind at 25 and sits at 5-11 after non-conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite having a clearly better overall record coming into this match-up, the Aggies NCSS (non-conference strength of schedule) ranked 301<sup>st</sup> of the 347 teams eligible in Division I college basketball.</p>\n<p>All-time, the Gauchos have owned the match-up between these two teams dating back to 1939 winning 28 of the 34 games played. Last season, UCSB defeated UC Davis three times during its nine-game winning streak including a regular season sweep and defeating them once more in the first round of the Big West Tournament 87-61.</p>\n<p>In order to repeat such dominance against a formidable opponent, Santa Barbara will need to rely heavily on the presence of point guard Eric Childress and shooting guard Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>Being the only senior on the team, Childress will certainly need to lead the example now that conference play has arrived. He currently ranks first on the team in three-point shooting percentage (37.5) assists (3.8) and steals (1.4) while averaging the second most minutes of anyone on the team (32.6).</p>\n<p>As a sophomore last season, Vincent averaged 18 points per game in three match-ups against the Aggies, shooting 45 percent from the field and 30 percent from three-point range. His worst performance, however, came at UC Davis where he only scored 13 points on 3-11 shooting and missed all four of his three-point attempts.</p>\n<p>Coming into this match, the junior is averaging 16.2 points per game, the highest on the team, but his shooting percentage only ranks ninth highest among his squad.</p>\n<p>As a team, one of the biggest things the Gauchos will need to change is their three-point shooting. Despite Childress and Vincent each shooting above 30 percent, the team ranks 336 out of 347 in the nation in three-point percentage at 28.7. In their two wins this season, UCSB shot a combined 40 percent from three-point range, indicating that when the three-ball is rolling, so it the team.</p>\n<p>Wanting to avenge the three losses from last season, the Aggies will look to rely on senior Brynton Lemar. The guard is second on the team in points per game (14.2) and put up some of his best performances last season against the Gauchos including his first career double-double last year at the Thunderdome with a 16 point and 11 rebound — another career high — performance.</p>\n<p>Another big name to watch out for is forward Chima Moneke who was awarded Big West Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career after averaging 17 points and 12 rebounds last week in two winning efforts. The junior transfer ranks first on the team in points (14.9) and rebounds (8.3).</p>\n<p>The new year brings about new hopes in fans that UCSB can turn around this season and make the most of it despite missing forwards Jalen Canty and Ami Lakoju after being ruled ineligible to play due to academic reasons. Having not won a Big West regular season title since 2009, it certainly would be a treat to win it this year with such a young team and after such a slow start.</p>\n<p>UCSB tips off conference play against UC Davis at The Pavillion on Wednesday, January 4<sup>th</sup> at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Gauchos shot a solid 46 percent from the field and a season-high 45 percent from beyond the arc in the first half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading the first-half charge was junior guard Gabe Vincent who had 17 points in the first half, thanks to 6-11 shooting from the field including 5-10 from three-point range. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 17 points marked the sixth time this season Vincent was in double figures by the end of the first half and his highest point total since scoring 20 in the first half against the University of San Diego.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior point guard Eric Childress also took on a big load scoring the first eight points for UCSB to help take the early lead. He would finish the night with 10 points, four assists, and six rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contributions off the bench were also a big factor in the Gauchos 47-point first half outburst as freshman guards Clifton Powell and Max Heidegger had seven and eight points, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In what could’ve been one of the turning points of the game had UCSB not lost, Powell scored five straight points, off of two sweet dishes from Vincent, in the final minute to help the Gauchos take a 47-33 lead into the break. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For most of the second half, the Gauchos seemed to be in complete control of the game. Although Seattle had cut it to eight with 15:53 left after a 12-6 run to kick off the final frame, Santa Barbara responded with 16-4 run over the next six minutes to take a commanding 69-49 lead with 9:37 left to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final 9:37 proceeded to be a painful experience for those who had hope that Gaucho basketball was finally turning the corner this year as they were outscored 31-7 in the final 9:37. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all started with a convincing 14-0 run by Seattle University that brought them within six with 4:52 left. Sophomore guard Zack Moore was huge knocking down two three balls while senior </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forward </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">William Powell came up with four huge rebounds and knocked in two big free throws during that 14-0 run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Seattle cut the lead back down to single digits and had hope, it was redshirt senior guard Brendan Westendorf who broke the heart of all UCSB fans in the building scoring 13 straight points, including knocking down three consecutive three-point shots to give his team a 72-71 advantage with 2:04 left.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After taking the lead the Redhawks never looked back, finishing off the Gauchos with a clutch free throw shooting down the stretch and winning the game 80-76. Westendorf finished with 28 points on the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing pains are expected with this young Santa Barbara team, who is now even more limited after the losses of Ami Lakoju and Jalen Canty, but this one was especially painful. After shooting 9-20 from three in the first half, the Gauchos shot an abysmal 3-17 from deep in the second half, dooming what once seemed an easy victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was also a tough finish for Vincent who scored no points in the second half and went 0-5 from three. In fact, it was a tough final half for every Gaucho as no player had double figures in the second half. Heidegger led the team with nine second half points but shot a below average 3-10 from the field in doing so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could only hope that with the new year approaching and conference play starting next week, the under-manned, young UCSB squad will tap into its full potential as it did last year, getting hot at just the right time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos next game will be at UC Davis in the Big West opener on Wednesday, Jan. 4 at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Tar Heels won the match 84-67.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and UCLA will meet for the 20<sup>th</sup> time on Wednesday, with the Gauchos only having won one game against the Bruins which was back in 2003 in a one-point victory.</p>\n<p>If UCSB has any hope of pulling off quite possibly the biggest upset in program history, then priority number one would be to stop the Bruins freshman point guard Lonzo Ball.</p>\n<p>Ball has become a household name across the country within UCLA’s ten-game winning streak due mostly to his proficient passing ability. The Chino Hills, CA native is second in the NCAA in assists averaging 8.8 per game and has already notched four double-double performances.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 30<sup>th</sup> against UCR, a fellow Big West opponent, Ball dished out 13 assists, breaking the record for UCLA’s single-game freshman assists record. Ball also averages 15 points per game, fourth best on the team, and is shooting a great 56 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Fellow freshman forward T.J. Leaf has also been nothing short of spectacular. The California native has averaged 17.6 points per game, second-best on the team, and 9.6 rebounds per game, best on the squad.</p>\n<p>Senior guards Bryce Alford and Isaac Hamilton have also played spectacular with Hamilton leading the team in scoring with 17.7 points per game, and Alford scoring double figures in nine of the Bruins’ ten games this season.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Bruins have looked unstoppable offensively in most games they have played this season scoring at least 90 points in seven of its 10 games this season.</p>\n<p>As of December 10<sup>th</sup>, UCLA ranked first in the nation in assists per game (23.9), field goal percentage (56.2) and three-point field goal percentage (47.1). The Bruins also average 97.5 points per game, second-best in the country.</p>\n<p>Certainly, taking on this hot team at the Pauley Pavilion will be a tough challenge, but something most Gauchos is up to. UCSB is led by juniors Gabe Vincent and Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Both players had excellent games on Sunday against the Toreros, with Vincent scoring 20 points in the first half on 8-11 shooting. The guard would finish with a game-high 23 points on the night. Vincent averages a team-high 17.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Canty had a less than stellar first half scoring no points and only pulling down one rebound. The forward turned it around in the second half scoring 14 points shooting a perfect 6-6 from the field and pulling down three rebounds before fouling out.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to look to those two early and often if they want to come out with a win and will also need hearty performances from senior guard Eric Childress who leads the team in assists with 4.3 per game and has knocked down at least one three ball in six of the teams’ seven games.</p>\n<p>Wednesday night will not be an easy one for this struggling Santa Barbara squad. However, a solid performance on the road against such a quality opponent could be the thing the Gauchos need. Whether or not there will be an upset alert tonight, fans should expect a tough performance from a Gaucho team that, although has only one win, has played hard in every game.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against the No. 2 UCLA at 7:30 p.m. at the Pauley Pavilion on Wednesday, December 14 with the game being available to watch on the PAC-12 network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

That didn’t change against the Gauchos as the home team was able to score a season-high 96 points in its rout.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_74470\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74470\" data-attachment-id=\"74470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-28/gauchos-struggles-continue-fall-to-0-5-after-96-72-loss-at-usc/gabe-vincent-drives-to-the-hoop-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gabe Vincent drives to the hoop.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite managing to hang around for most of the game with a solid 45 percent shooting from the field and having four players in double figures, UCSB had no chance of stopping a red-hot USC team who shot 54 percent from the field and was deadly from three knocking down 14 long balls, a season high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the Trojans were excellent with the three ball from the very beginning knocking down four of their first six attempts — two from junior standout guard Elijah Stewart — within the game’s first four minutes to take a commanding 14-6 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara answered throughout the majority of the match thanks to strong play from senior guard Eric Childress and junior guard Gabe Vincent. After a Vincent three, Childress matched him with one of his own to bring the score to 16-12 with 14:11 left in the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next eight minutes consisted of back-and-forth baskets by both teams with USC’s lead never growing larger eight</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After a layup by junior forward Alex Hart, the Gauchos found themselves only down by two at 25-23 with 6:36 left in the first half. Hart finished with a season-high 14 points after shooting 7-14 from the field in, another season high, 26 minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once UCSB cut the lead to two, USC went on a 16-8 run to take a 10-point lead with just over a minute left to play in the first half. Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright scored 10 of those points during the run and finished with a game-high 21. Santa Barbara managed to make it close before the half only going down 43-38.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although UCSB kept shooting well throughout the half, which led to them constantly cutting the lead, USC’s three-point range was so deadly that Santa Barbara could never tie the game let alone take the lead. In the first 20 minutes, the Trojans were 8-19 from three while the Gauchos were only 3-11.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the beginning of the second half came the resurgence of redshirt sophomore forward Ami Lakoju. The Harlem, N.Y. native only scored a total of nine points in his last three games, but scored six of his teams first 10 to spring the Gauchos early in the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would cut the lead to four with a big tip-in at the 14:23 mark, making the score 51-47. Lakoju would finish with 12 points in the contest. After back-to-back Trojan three’s, Childress responded with his second of the match to keep the score within single digits. The senior finished the contest with six points and a season-high seven assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as the second half continued, the same thing that doomed the Gauchos in three of their first four losses came to fruition yet again at the Galen Center. After a UCSB lay-up making the score 66-59, the Trojans finished the game on a 30-13 scoring run making the final score a 96-72 rout. Stewart had eight of those final 30 points and finished the night scoring 18.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet again, the second half woes seem to continue hurting Santa Barbara, who, at times, just cannot seem to get out of its own way. Despite the loss, there were many positives such as a season-low nine turnovers, the resurgence of Hart and Lakoju and scoring 44 points in the paint.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior forward Jalen Canty also finished with a monster game posting the second double-double of his career with a career-high 16 point and 10 rebound performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a 0-5 start is not ideal by any means, the Gauchos have the pieces in place to turn this season around as it is still very early, and with more and more contributions starting to come from younger players fitting into their roles, this could happen sooner rather than later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB resumes play against Sonoma St. at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Dec. 1 at the Thunderdome.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
