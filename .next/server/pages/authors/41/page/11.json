In the fourth inning, the Gauchos were finally able to get on the board after a Kyle Plantier RBI single that brought them within four runs.</p>\n<p>After three more scoreless innings in the fifth, sixth and seventh, Bush finally struck in the eighth inning, hitting a grand slam to center field and tying the game up at five apiece. It was the first baseman’s seventh home run of the season and the first four-RBI homer of his young career.</p>\n<p>In the final frame, redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover drove in the leading run, redshirt sophomore JJ Muno, for the Gauchos first lead of the game. It was Bush who struck yet again as he drove in three more runs with a double to left center, scoring Grover, redshirt junior Devon Gradford and redshirt sophomore Clay Fisher, making the score 9-5 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>That would end up being the final score of Sunday’s game after redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson picked up his seventh win of the season, bouncing back from a tough loss the previous night as he struck out two of the last three batters.</p>\n<p>Bush also became the first Gaucho to have a seven-RBI game in nearly 10 years as now UCSB assistant coach Chris Valaika hit seven against UC Davis on May 21, 2006.</p>\n<p>Before clinching a tough road series victory, Santa Barbara suffered a heartbreaking 5-4 loss that came down to the final pitch and a throw from Muno that was just off.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were up 3-0 early after scoring two runs in the second and one run in the top of the third frame before UCI countered with three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning courtesy of sophomore infielder Cole Kreuter’s two-RBI triple and redshirt senior infielder Grant Palmer’s RBI sac fly.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters then took the lead after junior Adam Alcantara drove in a run to make the score 4-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB tied the game in the seventh inning thanks to redshirt junior Andrew Calica’s bunt, which scored Tevin Mitchell after a throwing error by the UCI pitcher.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, UC Irvine had a chance to win the game in regular innings as it had the final opportunity in the bottom of the ninth. After loading the bases thanks to a single, a walk and a hit batter, Alcantara had a chance to drive in the winning run to go home winners or hit into a double play that would end the inning.</p>\n<p>The junior decided to go with the former and drove in John Brontsema to secure the 5-4 win. That, however, does not mean the play was not dramatic. Alcantara hit a line drive to left field, where third baseman Muno snagged it on a beautiful dive.</p>\n<p>Then an off-balance Muno tried to throw the ball to home plate to get the runner out but it was a bit out of the catcher’s reach and Brontsema was able to score.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLt1BhfzgbsF30dnjYcB4kmrtryqjRQ4U1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>It was a heartbreaker for the Gauchos and for Nelson, who picked up his second loss in less than a week after starting the season with a perfect 6-0 record. However, the right-hander was able to bounce back in Sunday’s game, proving why he is on the watch list for the top pitcher in the country.</p>\n<p>Before that gut-wrenching loss, UCSB was able to start the series off the right way and pick up a solid 10-3 victory to set the tone for the rest of the matches.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in the top of the third, where UCSB picked up three runs thanks to Muno’s RBI single and Grover’s two-RBI single. UCI countered in the bottom of the frame with one run courtesy of Alcantara’s RBI single, making the score 3-1 after three innings.</p>\n<p>Both teams scored two runs in the fourth inning to keep the lead the same for the Gauchos now at 5-3.  In the sixth, UCSB extended its lead by adding a run thanks to Mitchell’s RBI single.</p>\n<p>In the seventh, Santa Barbara really did some damage, capitalizing on an error by UCI to score one run and a balk by the pitcher which scored another run, making the score 8-3.</p>\n<p>Calica would drive in the final two runs in the same inning thanks to a single to right field, making the score 10-3. Both teams were unable to score after that, making the final score 10-3 in favor of the road team.</p>\n<p>Junior Shane Bieber had another solid day at the office, allowing 11 hits and three earned runs but striking out 10 batters while pitching his fourth complete game of the season. Bieber (10-3) is now only the 12th pitcher in Gaucho history to reach 10 wins on the season.</p>\n<p>It was a solid weekend overall for UCSB, whose season is coming to a close. It was a great way to end its average road record while also helping them pick up momentum as the playoffs approach.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game is at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium against Gonzaga at 3 p.m. on Monday, May 23.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The reason is simple: athletes don’t want to go play at a university where they won’t be competing for championships and garnering the exposure needed to reach the pro level.</p>\n<p>To turn around a program requires effort, dedication, money, but most importantly, it requires instilling a culture. Usually a program needs to instill a new culture to bring back a sense of attitude, and a new fire to show recruits that this will become a winning program.</p>\n<p>The UCSB baseball program is something that definitely needed a culture change back in 2011 when it was looking for a new head coach after the departure of Bob Brontsema who is still at UCSB, now serving as the assistant athletic director.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brontsema was a great coach as he attained the most wins in school history (483) after an illustrious 18-year career in which he also finished with the third best winning percentage (.503) in school history.</p>\n<p>Although Brontsema was a solid coach during his tenure, it was clear that after a 10-year hiatus from reaching a NCAA regional and not having won a Big West championship during his run, it was time for a change.</p>\n<p>At the same time, however, a young, eager assistant coach awaited his coaching opportunity located in Oregon. A man who was renowned as one of the best pitching coaches in the entire nation as well as a great recruiter. His name is Andrew Checketts.</p>\n<p>Checketts was no stranger to California or the Big West conference as he coached at UC Riverside for four years prior to becoming an assistant coach at Oregon. He knew about UCSB, and once he heard about the vacancy, he held hope that maybe he would get that call so he could finally become a head coach for the first time in his career.</p>\n<p>“When I heard the job become available I thought ‘I’d love to live in Santa Barbara and coach there,’” Checketts said. “That same day I went on a walk with my wife and kids, and, I’m not kidding, I got that call. At first I thought it was too good to be true so I sent it to voicemail, but when I check it later that day it was the AD [athletic director] asking me if I was interested and, of course, I was.”</p>\n<p>On June 22, 2011, UCSB announced that Andrew Checketts would become the ninth head coach in program history.</p>\n<p>Checketts knew the expectations of UCSB’s program and was more than ready to bring a new culture to the university’s ball club — something he has definitely instilled in the short five years he has been here.</p>\n<p>In his first season as the baseball coach, Checketts had 16 seniors on his squad to help make his transition a bit easier and managed to hire the right assistant coaches in play.</p>\n<p>“I knew the first thing any good head coach needs is a great staff, so the first person I got was [Eddie} Cornejo and he has been great,” Checketts said. “We assembled the best staff we could and quickly started trying to figure out what we wanted and how we wanted it done.”</p>\n<p>During his first campaign, the former Oregon State High School Player of the Year impressed everyone as he had the most wins by a first-year head coach in school history with 28. Checketts, who also serves as the teams pitching coach, had a historic throwing rotation that combined for a program best 451 strikeouts on the season.</p>\n<p>Although it was yet another year, the Gauchos did not go to an NCAA regional; everyone knew that the future looked bright. However, Checketts knew that the future would only be bright if he brought in a great group of recruits.</p>\n<p>Although money might have been tight at times, Checketts saw the potential UCSB had to offer young student athletes and began working his recruiting magic right away. In 2012, Checketts held the 18th best recruiting class — the best in school history to this day — 39th in 2013 and 32nd in 2014 all according to <em>Perfect Game</em>.</p>\n<p>“I think kids want to come to UCSB,” Checketts said. “It has unbelievable academics, great baseball weather and amazing location. I think this is one of the best places to go to school on the earth so it makes my job easier.”</p>\n<p>Since that first year in 2012, every year has been an improvement for the UCSB baseball team. The following year in 2013, the Gauchos broke their postseason curse and reached their first NCAA regional for the first time in 12 years, ending its last 22 games with a 16-6 record along with winning six consecutive series to enter the postseason with a 35-25 record.</p>\n<p>In 2014, although Santa Barbara did not make a regional, it posted more than 30 wins for the second straight season, making Checketts just the second head coach in program history to have back-to-back 30-plus win seasons.</p>\n<p>Finally, last year the team achieved a landmark milestone as the impact of the 2012 and 2013 recruiting classes reached their peak, and the Gauchos had arguably the best season in school history after going 40-17-1 to set a new record in most wins against a D1 schools. That season, Santa Barbara was selected to host the South region as the No. 1 seed in the 2015 NCAA Regionals for the first time in program history.</p>\n<p>Although it did not make it out of the first round last year, there is no doubt that the UCSB baseball team has the most significant piece it needs to eventually make a run at the College World Series: A head coach.</p>\n<p>Since his arrival in 2011, Checketts has made significant impact as the programs winning percentage has gone from .500 to .702. He has also played a major role in the pitching department as the programs’ career ERA has made a significant drop from 4.14 in 2012 to 2.45 in 2015.</p>\n<p>Checketts 137-87-1 overall record during his first four full years of coaching currently places him as the Gauchos’ leader in career overall winning percentage (.612) and career conference winning percentage (.556).</p>\n<p>This season the UCSB baseball team is still making noise as it again already registered more than 30 wins on the season and enjoyed the success of breaking a 30-year old school record in consecutive home wins, which is now at 17.</p>\n<p>Even with all this success, Checketts’ humble persona reminds him constantly he could not have done this without his predecessors. He also knows there is still much more work to be done.</p>\n<p>“You know I haven’t really looked up yet,” Checketts said. “We still haven’t won a championship and we still have a lot of work to do, so me and my staff just keep working hard to reach that goal. They deserve a bunch of credit because the continuity of this staff has certainly helped me grow a lot.”</p>\n<p>However, just because coach Checketts cannot truly accept all the praise he deserves, there are certainly no lack of people willing to give him said praise for all the incredible work he has done here at UCSB including his own players.</p>\n<p>“He has made me a more mature person and a better ball player,” redshirt sophomore infielder J.J. Muno said. “I knew he was a good coach, and he had an amazing staff and he was going to take this program to new places and I wanted to be apart of it.”</p>\n<p>“He always pushes me to be a better and better player and I will always be thankful for that.” sophomore first baseman Austin Bush added. “He knows how to push you to your limits and I love that.”</p>\n<p>Changing the culture at UCSB has been a successful endeavor so far but it is not over yet and Checketts is committed for the ride after signing a contract extension through 2020.</p>\n<p>“Nothing great is ever easy and instilling this culture has not been an easy thing. It has taken away time from my wife and kids but luckily I have the best wife who continues to push me,” Checketts said. “But I am dedicated to this program and passionate about Gaucho baseball and I am here for the long haul.”</p>\n<p>Certainly turning around a program is no easy feat, but it certainly is a rewarding one. To know that the time and effort put in to changing a culture has not been a waste certainly must be fulfilling if nothing else. And there is no doubt that newer recruits are seeing the culture change at Santa Barbara and want to come here to be a part of something special.</p>\n<p>Andrew Checketts has been a tremendous coach for UCSB and hopefully he stays at UCSB until he retires. With his immense dedication there is no doubt he will one day get to Omaha and hoist a National Championship for the Gauchos.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In those six games they were outscored 43-20.</p>\n<p>Being away from home is usually enough to get UCSB off its game, as it only has an 8-11-1 record; however, a close 4-3 win at UCLA this past Tuesday might have come at just the right moment so that it can go into the UCI game with some confidence.</p>\n<p>Since 2002, the Gauchos have struggled immensely against the Anteaters posting a 14-28 record. It also does not help that Santa Barbara has not won a series at UC Irvine since 1986, but will definitely look to change that this year as its playoff lives depend on it.</p>\n<p>As most of these conference series go, the home team usually holds the advantage in terms of winning, as the past has consistently shown. Last season, UCSB swept UCI at home; two of wins had only one-run differences. However, two years ago when the series was at the Anteaters’ home, they swept the Gauchos in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>UCI will rely on its batting success to get it through this series, as it currently boasts the top batting average (.280), the top on-base percentage (.363) and the second best slugging percentage (.374) in the conference.</p>\n<p>One big factor in that is sophomore Keston Hiura, who has a .382 batting average, third best in the Big West. His home runs (seven) and RBI’s (37) are also third best in the conference, while his slugging percentage (.580) is the best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s success in road games usually comes down to how the young pitching staff reacts to the pressure of the large road crowds. In their 20 road games this season, the pitching staff has allowed 91 earned runs compared to only 96 earned runs at home through 26 games.</p>\n<p>This month in particular, the inexperience and lack of depth has really shown itself, as the pitching staff has a combined 5.52 ERA, 54 earned runs and has allowed six home runs through 10 games. In the month of April, the throwing rotation had a 3.38 ERA, 53 earned runs and only four home runs allowed in 16 games.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the return of two solid pitchers from injury, redshirt junior James Carter and redshirt senior Justin Kelly, can help the struggling rotation. In his three appearances since his Tommy John surgery, Carter has been pitching five solid innings, allowing only five hits and no runs while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>Kelly has also been solid as in 5.1 innings pitched he has allowed one run and four hits while striking out seven batters.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be no easy task for the Gauchos, but it certainly is necessary if they want to make a run at the postseason. They also need to get back to their winning ways so that if they make the postseason they can do more than just be one and done.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UCI at Cicerone Field on Friday, May 20 at 6:30 p.m., Saturday, May 21 at 7 p.m. and Sunday, May 22 at 6 p.m. Saturday’s game will be live-broadcasted on Fox Sports Prime Ticket while Sunday’s will be live on ESPNU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The loss was a tough one for the Bruins as it dropped them to 24-26 on the season and ruined their chances of making the postseason this year, as they needed to win their final seven games.</p>\n<p>The win was a much-needed one for Santa Barbara as it brings their road record to 8-11-1 and gives them momentum heading into its final road series of the season this weekend. It also broke the Gauchos two-game losing streak they were on after dropping the last two matches of the Cal State Fullerton series this past weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara came out of the gates strong in the pitching department as redshirt junior James Carter added to his previous strong outings by throwing two hard innings and allowing only two hits.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finally broke through in the top of the third inning to take a 1-0 lead after redshirt junior center fielder Andrew Calica hit a one-shot home run, his fourth of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB added one run in both the fourth and fifth innings to take a solid 3-0 lead after six innings of play. In the seventh, however, the Bruins came to life scoring three runs and tying the game. Freshman catcher Jake Hirabayashi, senior second baseman Brett Urabe and junior first baseman Luke Persico all recorded RBI-singles for the three runs.</p>\n<p>All three runs were unearned and, therefore, did not count towards freshman pitcher Kyle Hatton’s ERA; however, the damage was done and once again it looked like Santa Barbara was going to blow a lead.</p>\n<p>However, in the top of the eighth, the Gauchos proved that they can bounce back and re-took a one-run lead at 4-3 after redshirt sophomore JJ Muno hit the game-winning double RBI for his team.</p>\n<p>Pitchers Justin Kelly and Kyle Nelson sealed the deal in the bottom of the eighth and ninth frames to secure a one-run victory. Kelly, a redshirt senior, picked up his first win of the season while Nelson, a redshirt sophomore, picked up his seventh save of the season.</p>\n<p>The victory was also the 11th win of the one-run variety for the young Gaucho team, a good sign that they are not afraid of being in tight ball games although they have let some slip.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB’s victory was a solid one, and it hopefully gives the team fire as it travels to UCI for its final road series of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has not won a series at Irvine since 1986, which is coincidentally also the last time it won a Big West title.</p>\n<p>Although they have taken two series victories in 2013 and 2015, the Gauchos are 14-28 against the Anteaters since 2002 and any momentum that they have gained through the UCLA win should definitely be welcomed as they head into that tough environment.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UCI at Cicerone Field for a three game series this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

They are currently playing the worst baseball they have all season after going 2-5 in the last seven games, and with three of those losses coming at home, a place where UCSB had only lost once this season prior to this current stretch of games.</p>\n<p>The Titans are now 32-17 overall with a 14-4 Big West record, good for first place in the standings. With six games remaining in conference play, CSUF now has a three-game lead over second place LBSU — who they have yet to play — and a four-game lead over UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sunday’s game was a big one for the Gauchos, as they still had a chance to win the series over a very good Fullerton team. They also needed to bounce back from an embarrassing 18-2 loss on Saturday.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara started off the game slow, allowing two runs in the first inning to Fullerton. CSUF then extended its lead to 3-0 after adding a run in the third inning.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the fourth, the Gauchos finally struck back as a two-RBI double by junior utility player Billy Fredrick brought them back to within one run.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning, UCSB tied the game at 3-3 after a solid RBI double from redshirt junior outfielder Devon Gradford.</p>\n<p>Although three runs were enough to win Friday’s game, it was not enough to beat the Titans on Sunday, as they rallied off one run to take a 4-3 in the seventh courtesy of a wild pitch from redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson.</p>\n<p>After that, CSUF never looked back. In the eighth inning they scored two more runs to take a 6-3 lead after an error by the UCSB second baseman scored two Fullerton runners.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went cold the last three innings, mustering only one hit, which led to their eventual 6-3 loss.</p>\n<p>Nelson (6-1) picked up his first loss of the season after allowing the go-ahead run in the seventh. On the CSUF side, junior pitchers Dylan Prohoroff (1-1) and Scott Serigstad combined to allow only one hit in the final 3.1 innings of play.</p>\n<p>Before losing the series on a tough game, Santa Barbara suffered its worst loss of the season after being blown out on their home turf by a final score of 18-2.</p>\n<p>The Titans were able to score at least one run in seven of the nine innings of the match and their seven-run outburst — which came when they were already up 7-2 — in the sixth inning is what put away the Gauchos for good.</p>\n<p>The 18-run, 21-hit game allowed by the Gauchos is the most they allowed all season in both those categories, with their 16-run loss being their worst run differential loss of the year.</p>\n<p>CSUF designated hitter Ruben Cardenas had a career day, setting career highs in hits and RBIs. The freshman went 4-6 (.667) with six RBIs, three runs scored and a big two-run homer in the seventh inning, his second of the season.</p>\n<p>Senior first baseman Tanner Pinkston also had a great game, going 4-5 (.800) with three RBIs and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the nine innings, Titan pitchers combined to allow only four hits and two runs while striking out seven batters. Nothing went right for the Gauchos on either end of the mound.</p>\n<p>Before Saturday’s embarrassing loss, UCSB actually managed to gain the early advantage on CSUF after sneaking by with a 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in the second inning as redshirt sophomore third baseman J.J. Muno hit his fifth home run of the season, a solo shot that put the Gauchos up 1-0.</p>\n<p>The Titans responded in the fourth inning after junior infielder Timmy Richards hit his team high eighth home run of the season to tie the game up at one.</p>\n<p>UCSB then hit another home run, this one courtesy of freshman catcher Sam Cohen — the first of his career — to re-take a one run lead at 2-1.</p>\n<p>CSUF tied the game at two after another RBI from Richards, but the Gauchos freshman infielder Tevin Mitchell hit an RBI ground out to take the 3-2 lead after the seventh inning.</p>\n<p>Nelson then picked up his sixth save of the season after pitching the final two frames, allowing only one hit.</p>\n<p>Junior Shane Bieber (9-3) pitched a great game, allowing only six hits and two runs in seven innings pitched while also striking out six batters. The win gave him the 20th of his career, and he is now tied for eighth in UCSB program history for career wins.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara squandered an amazing opportunity to really move up the rankings and break the slump it has been in. Instead, its two home losses this past weekend tied its loss total in the first 24 home games of the season.</p>\n<p>The home-field advantage the Gauchos used to have seems to have dissipated as they have now lost three of their last four home games.</p>\n<p>As the season nears its end, UCSB has to figure out its issue of poor play soon or its once promising season will end in a disappointing fashion.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is against UCLA at Jackie Robinson Stadium on Tuesday, May 16 at 6 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

UCSB has been amazing at home this year, boasting a 21-2 record at their home field and having set the school record for most consecutive home victories at 17.</p>\n<p>In the last four games, however, UCSB has ranged from looking average to plain awful.

Only 11 pitchers in UCSB history have reached 10 wins in a season.</p>\n<p>Nelson trails only the two CSUF pitchers in conference ERA with 2.14 and was recently named to the National Pitcher of the Year Watch List.</p>\n<p>Although there is still time left this season, it is certainly crunch time for Santa Barbara.

The CSUB Roadrunners improve to 12-34 on the season and have won their last three games, their longest streak of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For Santa Barbara, this loss is a bad one. Not only was it a loss to a much inferior opponent, but it came at a time when the team is struggling to keep the national spotlight as it has dropped out of the D1 Baseball Top 25 National Rankings.</p>\n<p>The loss is also made worse by the team’s lackluster performance. UCSB blew a 3-0 lead heading into the eighth inning and a 4-3 lead going into the final frame.</p>\n<p>Not only that but the Gauchos left 11 runners on base including six in scoring position. They only mustered in one run in the second and third innings combined after having the bases loaded in both of those frames.</p>\n<p>Combine that with two errors that proved to be costly, base-running mistakes and simple misplays of the baseball and one can easily see that UCSB deserved to lose Tuesday’s game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were coming off a tough series against UC Davis, but were back at home where they had won 17 straight games and boasted a 21-1 record, so it was not a far-fetched idea to think they could win this game easily.</p>\n<p>UCSB started the scoring in the third inning thanks to redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno’s sac-fly RBI that scored redshirt junior Andrew Calica to take a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the fourth inning, Santa Barbara again added one run to extend its lead to 2-0 after redshirt freshman catcher Thomas Rowan hit an RBI single.</p>\n<p>In the fifth frame, sophomore first baseman Austin Bush hit his sixth home run of the season, a team high, which scored one run to make the score 3-0 after five.</p>\n<p>The combination of pitchers James Carter (a redshirt junior), Kevin Chandler (a freshman) and Justin Kelly (a redshirt senior) was phenomenal for the first seven innings as the three combined to allow just three hits, two walks, four strikeouts and, most importantly, no runs.</p>\n<p>In the top of the eighth inning, left-handed pitcher Kyle Hatton was called on to continue the momentum. However, the moment seemed too much for the freshman as he gave up three runs — two earned — as CSUB tied the game after the top of the eighth.</p>\n<p>“You know, in hindsight I probably should’ve kept [Justin] Kelly in for a little while longer,” Checketts said. “I think I was thinking about saving him for this weekend and that might’ve been a mistake.”</p>\n<p>After an error by the Gauchos, and with Hatton hitting the next batter, the Roadrunners had two runners on base with no outs. Senior Chance Gusbeth then made UCSB pay by hitting a two-RBI triple to left field, encroaching on UCSB’s 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettancourt then came on to pitch, but he did not fare any better as the next batter, junior infielder Ryan Grotjohn, hit an RBI single scoring Gusbeth and tying the game at three.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the eighth inning, UCSB seemed to wake up as it managed to retake the lead at 4-3 thanks to freshman catcher Sam Cohen, who came in as a sub for Rowan and hit an RBI single to score shortstop Clay Fisher.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had a chance to put Bakersfield away for good, but instead Bettancourt gave up four hits and two runs giving the Roadrunners their first lead of the game at 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was again Gusbeth and Grotjohn who made the key plays as the senior hit a sac-fly RBI to tie the game and the junior hit the game-winning RBI single.</p>\n<p>Grotjohn hit the ball right to Bush, the first baseman, who misplayed it and was unable to get the final out of the inning, which would’ve have left the game tied at four but instead gave Bakersfield the lead.</p>\n<p>“We just played bad. We walk three guys, hit two guys,” Checketts said. “We can’t catch [the ball], the quality of the at-bats are not great. Just bad effort.”</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the final frame, the Gauchos had their chance to tie and it came down to junior utility Billy Fredrick to get the tying runner, who was on second, home.</p>\n<p>Fredrick hit a beautiful line drive to the right side of the infield but CSUB first baseman Cody White made an amazing diving catch for the final out to seal his team’s 12<span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 20px;\">th</span> victory of the season.</p>\n<p>It was truly an off-day for an often on-point Gaucho team. This loss could either be the beginning of two tales for the young UCSB team. Either this team wakes up and starts playing with the fire it showed early in the season or it could squander its promising start.</p>\n<p>Either way, the answer will come very soon as Santa Barbara’s next series is at home against the top team in the Big West standings and reigning champions Cal State Fullerton this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Normally, after winning Saturday’s game, you would expect UCSB to come out firing. However, this was not the case.</p>\n<p>The Aggies beat the Gauchos on their Davis home grass 13-3, administering the second worst loss of the season to their opponents and outhitting them 17-6 over the course of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB started strong, taking a 2-0 lead after the top of the second inning thanks to redshirt sophomore JJ Muno earning an RBI single and later scoring a run himself.</p>\n<p>The Aggies roared back in the bottom half of the frame, scoring four runs, two of which came from sophomore Brad Pluschkell’s two-RBI double down the left field line.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless third from both teams, UC Davis went on to score two runs in the fourth, two in the fifth, three in the sixth and two in the seventh to take a commanding 13-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added one measly run in the top of the eighth to make it 13-3, but it was not nearly enough to dig themselves out of the huge deficit they faced.</p>\n<p>UC Davis had many big hitters over the course of this game, including freshman Logan Denholm, who went 3-5 (.600) and finished with four RBI, two runs and one big, two-shot home run in the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>Senior Tanner Bily had a perfect hitting day, going 3-3 with two runs scored and an RBI. Sophomores Pluschkell and Justin Allen had an identical night, both going 3-5 (.600) on the day and scoring two runs and batting in two.</p>\n<p>Freshman Kyle Hatton (3-1) had a tough outing for the Gauchos. The left-handed pitcher picked up his first loss of the season after allowing four hits and four runs in 1.1 innings.</p>\n<p>Relieving sophomore pitchers Kyle Nelson and Kenny Chapman did not fare any better, combining to allow 12 hits and nine runs, eight of which were earned runs, in only 4.2 innings.</p>\n<p>Only one UCSB hitter, redshirt junior outfielder Devon Gradford, registered more than one hit on the evening.</p>\n<p>Before Sunday’s terrible blowout, Santa Barbara managed to tie the series at one after defeating UC Davis 7-3 in a game that was pushed back two hours past the original start time due to rainy conditions.</p>\n<p>Once the game commenced, the Aggies looked ready to play, taking an early 1-0 lead after freshman Alex Roeser was walked on with the bases loaded, picking up an RBI. Redshirt sophomore pitcher Joe Record forced the next batter into a fielder’s choice to stop the bleeding.</p>\n<p>After the teams traded two scoreless innings, the Gauchos went off in the fourth inning, scoring four runs to take a 4-1 lead. Redshirt juniors Ryan Cumberland and Andrew Calica both hit RBI fly outs while freshmen Michael McAdoo and Thomas Rowan hit RBI singles.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara added a run in the top of the sixth which UC Davis quickly countered in the bottom half of the frame with a run of its own to make the score 5-2.</p>\n<p>Freshman Caleb van Blake hit a sac fly in the bottom of the eighth inning for UC Davis to cut the lead to 5-3 and give his team some hope down the final stretch.</p>\n<p>However, sophomore Austin Bush put the game away in the top of the ninth inning, blasting a two-run homer to right field and ending the game at 7-3 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>The home run by Bush, the team’s first baseman, was his fifth of the season and now is the new team high. It was the sophomore’s only hit of the day, but it was a big one.</p>\n<p>Record (5-4) was able to pick up his fifth win of the season after going six innings and allowing only one earned run while striking out seven batters. Nelson picked up his team-high fifth save of the season.</p>\n<p>Before evening up the series, Santa Barbara struggled to stop UC Davis in the final two innings of the first game, leading to its eventual 6-2 loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked fine in the first innings, especially in the second when they scored two runs thanks to sophomore Clay Fisher’s RBI single and Calica’s RBI walk to take the early 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the next four innings neither team scored, meaning UCSB kept its 2-0 advantage. Junior pitcher Shane Bieber was great throughout the first six innings, allowing only three hits while striking out seven batters.</p>\n<p>It looked as though the pitcher was going to cruise into his career-high and Big West-high ninth victory until the bottom of the seventh, when UC Davis rallied three runs off three hits to take a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were unable to retaliate in the top of the eighth, which meant the Aggies could extend their lead in the bottom half.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettencourt pitched only 0.1 innings but allowed three hits and three more runs to UC Davis, which put them up 6-2 after eighth and it was enough to seal its victory.</p>\n<p>Senior Spencer Henderson played a big role in both those innings, earning his team’s first run of the day after an RBI double which scored Denholm and the team’s last run after an RBI single which also scored Denholm.</p>\n<p>The left-handed pitcher/first baseman went 3-4 (.750) on the day with two RBI and one run scored. Denholm went 2-4 (.500) with two runs scored.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos road woes keep plaguing them this season as 11 of the team’s 12 losses have been away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Its road record is now 7-11-1 on the season, the fourth worst in the Big West.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that UCSB is a contender and a tough opponent, but as some point it will need to prove it can win on the road on a more consistent basis.</p>\n<p>The NCAA Regionals, Super Regionals and College World Series will not be held at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium, so in order for this team to be as successful as it wants to be it must be able to go on the road and win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game is Tuesday, May 10 against CSU Bakersfield at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

To this point, it has only registered a 6-9-1 record away from home. UCSB’s last series against a conference opponent on the road ended with them surrendering all three games to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>To its credit, however, the Gauchos won their last game on the road, at St. Mary’s, in an 11-inning thriller that ended with a final score of 4-3.</p>\n<p>This season, UC Davis has taken a step back from last year in which it finished 30-26-1. With two or more losses in its final 14 games, it would already have more losses than it did a year ago. However, the Aggies are currently riding their longest winning streak of the season, which is ongoing at four.</p>\n<p>These two teams met a year ago in Santa Barbara with the home team registering the sweep. Still, all three games were close with two of them ending in a one-run victory for the Gauchos. UCSB has not lost a game in Dobbins Stadium since in the Andrew Checketts era and has won the last five series against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>In conference games this season, the Aggies have been in the middle of the pack ranking fifth in on-base percentage (.339), sixth in batting average (.262) and seventh in slugging percentage (.344).</p>\n<p>Big hitters for UC Davis include senior outfielder Cameron Olsen who leads the team with 23 RBI, home runs (3), batting average (.337), on-base percentage (.404) and slugging percentage (.609).</p>\n<p>He is helped by junior Mark Cardinalli who ranks ninth in the conference in batting average with a .327.</p>\n<p>However, one major problem for the Aggies is their earned run average which ranks dead last, ninth, in the conference at 6.99.</p>\n<p>Big time Gaucho hitters will look to take advantage of that mismatch and attack early and often. UCSB is led by sophomore first baseman Austin Bush who leads the team in batting average (.326) and RBI (32) which also ranks 10<sup>th</sup> and fifth in the conference respectively.</p>\n<p>Catcher Dempsey Grover is another top-20 hitter in conference in batting average which is currently at .309. Redshirt sophomore infielder J.J. Muno has also been solid for the team ranking second in hits (42) and tied for first in home runs (4).</p>\n<p>UCSB also has two of the better pitchers in conference with junior Shane Beiber (8-2) and sophomore Kyle Nelson (6-0). Nelson currently holds the best ERA in the conference, 36<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA, with a 1.80 ERA and his 59 strikeouts are 12<sup>th</sup> best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Beiber ranks first in the conference in wins with eight, tying a career high, eighth in the Big West in strikeouts (59) and 13<sup>th</sup> in ERA (3.12).</p>\n<p>This is a big weekend for the Gauchos as they have the opportunity to keep moving up the conference rankings with a series against one of the weaker opponents they will face this season. They also need to prove they can win away from their impenetrable home fortress.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces UC Davis starting Friday, May 8 at Dobbins Stadium at 2:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday’s game are at the same location and both are at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

They have also gutted out some tough victories as three of the last five have been decided by one run, including the game against St. Mary’s, which went 11 innings, their second longest match of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB displayed a solid performance in both sides of the field and was able to pick up its 30th win of the season for the fourth consecutive year. This is only the second time in program history that the team has accomplished this feat, with the last time coming during the 1982-1987 seasons.</p>\n<p>It was a great sight in the first inning of the game to see redshirt junior pitcher James Carter get his first action since coming back from Tommy John surgery last season.</p>\n<p>“I was excited to see him [Carter] back,” Checketts said. “It was good to see him pitch good as well.”</p>\n<p>The right-hander only went one inning, but it sure was a strong one, allowing one hit, no runs and also striking out one of the Waves’ best hitters in junior Manny Jefferson.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous through the first couple of guys, but then I settled in and felt confident after that,” Carter said.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of that inning, the Gauchos started quick, taking an early 1-0 lead as the first three hitters all got singles with the latter batter. Redshirt sophomore left fielder Josh Adams ripped an RBI single thanks to a great hit to left field, scoring redshirt junior center fielder Andrew Calica and moving sophomore short stop Clay Fisher to second.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Kyle Hatton stepped in after Carter’s solid inning and allowed only one hit in the second and third inning combined. In the fourth, however, Pepperdine tied the game at one thanks to Jefferson’s 11th home run of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would respond in the bottom of the fifth inning, adding two runs and going up 3-1 after freshman Tevin Mitchell scored on an error by the Waves and Fisher’s RBI single down center field and scoring Calica.</p>\n<p>UCSB added to its lead in the next inning after freshman catcher Sam Cohen, in his ninth game of the season, hit an RBI double to right field, scoring teammate Devon Gradford and giving his team the 4-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Just as the Waves looked like they were done for the night, junior outfielder Matt Gelalich hit an RBI single in the seventh frame that just got by the Gauchos’ first baseman and cut the lead to two runs.</p>\n<p>In the top of the eighth inning with one out, senior first baseman Brad Anderson hit a solo shot home run off of Trevor Bettencourt, who had just replaced Hatton, that again brought Pepperdine close to tying the game, which was now 4-3.</p>\n<p>The Waves would have tied the game, but thankfully the redshirt junior Bettencourt caught junior Aaron Barnett off guard and was able to pick him off at first for the team’s first out. Had that not happened, Anderson’s homer would have been a two-shot and the game could have ended differently.</p>\n<p>Bettencourt was the pitcher who let down his team down in the Gauchos’ only home loss of the season to St. Mary’s after giving up five runs in the eighth frame of that game.</p>\n<p>After the homer and accidently hitting Jefferson and the head putting him on first base, the right-hander did not look afraid of the situation and showed his skills, striking out redshirt sophomore Ben Rodriguez and forcing sophomore Lambert Chase into a fielder’s choice for the final out of the inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did nothing in the bottom of the eighth and relied on its defense to finish off the game. After two easy outs, Pepperdine made the game interesting, ripping off two singles and having runners on first and second.</p>\n<p>Calica, the team’s great center fielder, made an impressive catch by tracking the ball on a hit that looked like it was about to go over his head for the final out, and sealed the 4-3 victory and 17th straight home win.</p>\n<p>Although the win was not the most impressive of the Gauchos’ season, it still was a win nonetheless, and it again displayed the team’s ability to grind tough wins as they are now 11-1 in one-run games.</p>\n<p>Pitching-wise, Hatton was fantastic, picking up his third win of the season after going six innings and allowing five hits and two runs while striking out a career-high 10 batters.</p>\n<p>“Kyle Hatton was great with his three pitches,” Checketts said. “He has a sort of invisible fastball. It never breaks 80 [mph], but no one can hit it.”</p>\n<p>In terms of pitcher James Carter, UCSB will continue to monitor him with care and make sure he is progressing steadily as the season heads into crunch time.</p>\n<p>“He will get more pitches each time he’s out there and we will continue to see how he feels,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be throwing next week, and each week my pitch count will go up, and I’m excited about that,” Carter added.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next series will be against UC Davis at Dobbins Baseball Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The team also boasts a 20-1 overall home record on the season, another program record.</p>\n<p>The Waves heads into its second match-up of the season against the Gauchos with a respectable 20-18 record and a 10-8 conference record. Pepperdine already coasted by Santa Barbara once this season winning the March 29 match 6-2, at home.</p>\n<p>These two teams have already met once before with the aforementioned victor being the Waves. Although Santa Barbara has been almost unbeatable at home, however, on the road it has struggled mustering a 6-9-1 record which could have played a factor in the last game.</p>\n<p>“They took it to us a bit at there place.” Clark said. “We just got to come out swinging and play better.”</p>\n<p>Another big factor in the late march match-up was redshirt junior infielder Matt Crowder who went 3-4 (.750) on the day and scored one run that gave Pepperdine the 3-2 advantage and the team never looked back.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Matt Bernard also had a solid outing going 1-2 (.500) with one RBI and two runs.</p>\n<p>As an entire staff, Pepperdine’s pitching was on point surrendering only five hits and two runs through the nine innings, with sophomore Matt Green picking up the victory after allowing only two hits and no runs in 3.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>During the course of the season, the Waves have gotten great performances from junior Manny Jefferson who leads the team in RBI (33), home runs (10), hits (44) and slugging percentage (.579). The infielder won West Coast Conference Player of the Week two weeks ago after hitting four home runs during the week.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine also has one of the best pitchers in D1 NCAA baseball in A.J. Puckett. The junior is fifth in the NCAA in ERA (1.01) and has not allowed an earned run in his last seven starts and 54.2 innings — the longest streak of any pitcher this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to its slew of hitters to help take care of the Waves good pitching staff which has been solid all season posting a 3.99 team ERA which ranks 88th in the country out of 295.</p>\n<p>Big time hitters to watch out for will be sophomore Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (32), hits (44) and slugging percentage (.508). Sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover is another solid hitter batting .309, third best on the team, and is coming off a solid five-RBI weekend.</p>\n<p>Another interesting storyline will be the return of redshirt junior James Carter who will be the starting pitcher tomorrow. The right-hander will see his first action this season after rehabbing from Tommy John Surgery.</p>\n<p>“We are excited to see him come back for us.” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “He was a solid closer for us last year and we will see what happens.”</p>\n<p>Last season he earned the honors of being the teams closer and registered five saves and one win in seven appearances allowing six hits and no earned runs in 9.2 innings pitched while also striking out 12 batters.</p>\n<p>The California native did not appear in a game after March 6 due to injury but was still taken in the 27th round of the 2015 MLB First-Year Player Draft by the Houston Astros before ultimately deciding to come back to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“He was drafted even though he was injured and I think that is a testament to how good he was,” Coach Checketts said. “It will be interesting to see how he comes back, overall we are excited.”</p>\n<p>While it is unclear how long Carter will pitch, what is clear is the hope that he can bounce back well from his injury and help a pitching staff that, although is solid, is a bit short staffed and could use some help.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have already avenged a loss against a team it lost to early in the year which was St. Mary’s and will hope to do the same against Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Not only would they avenge an earlier loss, but a win against the Waves would improve an already great season and would extend a record that is ongoing.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s faces off against Pepperdine today at Ceasar Uyesaka Stadium at 3 p.m. in hopes of improving its 16 game home winning streak.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Rainbow Warriors have now lost their last five games.</p>\n<p>This sweep was yet another achievement for the Gauchos as they have now won all five home weekend series, continue their best home start in school history (20-1) and now have swept two conference opponents, a task that is never easy.</p>\n<p>“It’s great to have these opportunities to sweep.” Checketts said. “In baseball in general its hard [to sweep]. We did not play great baseball but the guys hung in there and got a win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to clinch the sweep of Hawaii in style winning Sunday’s game in walk-off fashion that had fans and players out of their seats when they saw the collision at home plate that won the game 5-4.</p>\n<p>Hawaii began the scoring in this ball game as in the first inning senior Jacob Sheldon-Collins hit an RBI single giving his team the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded quickly as catcher Grover Dempsey tied the game at one after hitting a fielder’s choice RBI. An RBI triple by sophomore infielder J.J. Muno made the score 2-1 in favor of UCSB after two innings.</p>\n<p>In the fourth inning, the Rainbow Warriors were able to score two runs to retake the lead at 3-2 after a home run by freshman infielder Ethan Lopez and an RBI double by senior Matt LoCoco. Hawaii added one run in the fifth to go up 4-2 after five innings.</p>\n<p>As it had done all season, Santa Barbara fought back and in the sixth inning tied the game up at four after a sac fly by sophomore shortstop Clay Fisher, and an RBI single from Muno.</p>\n<p>The game then got really interesting in the final inning of play. With one out and runners on first and second the Gauchos called upon freshman Noah Davis, who had been struggking with a toe injury, to get them out of this jam.</p>\n<p>He didn’t look so hot at first as after an errant pitch, both runners were able to steal a base and now were in scoring position. Davis then walked the batter making it bases loaded for junior Marcus Doi.</p>\n<p>The freshman broke from his shaky start and pitched it well against Doi, eventually making him hit a grounder that the Gauchos were able to convert into a double play and get them out of the inning unscaved.</p>\n<p>“That double play was big for us.” Checketts said. “Noah [Davis] coming in and making that pitch on his bad toe.”</p>\n<p>The game still tied at four, the Gauchos now had a chance to win it in the bottom half of the final frame. Senior Ryan Clark wasted no time getting on base with a single, then stealing second to get into scoring position.</p>\n<p>After a bunt by redshirt junior Andrew Calica, Clark was now on third base while the Gauchos only had one out so they were in perfect position to win the game.</p>\n<p>Freshman Michael McAdoo had the honors of trying to seal a victory for his team and did just that hitting a fielder’s choice RBI. His hit was a short one that was quickly grabbed by the shortstop who threw it home in hopes of getting Clark out.</p>\n<p>“A backbreaker for them.” Checketts said. “We got a green read at third so we are going on contact and the catcher just missed it. Tough break for them, great break for us.”</p>\n<p>The two players, Clark and freshman catcher Kekai Rios, collided as the senior slid at home base for the win. Rios was unable to handle the ball while also taking a punishing hit and thus the Gauchos won in tremendous walk-off fashion.</p>\n<p>“He was blocking the plate pretty good so I knew I had to go in real hard and luckily he missed the ball.” Clark said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would only need walk-off win in Sunday’s game as the Saturday’s and Friday’s games were much easier wins for the team.</p>\n<p>UCSB put together a great eighth inning scoring three runs which led to its solid 6-3 victory and made history as it was their 15<sup>th</sup> consecutive home win, a school record that now stands at 16 after Sunday’s win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked good early scoring two runs in the third inning to take a solid 2-0 lead after three. Hawaii responded as Doi’s RBI double and Lopez’s two RBI single gave the Rainbow Warriors a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB tied the game up at three after an error by Hawaii allowed Muno to score the tying run.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the eighth, Dempsey gave his team a 4-3 lead after hitting a solo shot to left field. Muno would then score on a wild pitch and Calica added one final run hitting a sac fly to score teammate Fisher, giving the Gauchos a 6-3 lead.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettancourt shut down Hawaii in the ninth and made sure no comeback was possible and secured the 6-3 victory. The right hander allowed only one hit in three innings of play.</p>\n<p>After the win, the Gauchos were happy to make history and break a record that had stood for so long but were aware that this was not enough.</p>\n<p>“We got a good group of dudes and I’m happy about that.” Clark said. “This is cool but we just have to keep winning no matter where we are.”</p>\n<p>The win was big in a slew of fashion, not just for breaking the school record, but it also marked the first time UCSB had won a series at home against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“They’re a really good team.” Clark said. “No matter the situation, our guys stay cool and find a way to win. I’ve never experienced something like this before.”</p>\n<p>Before achieving two feats on Saturday, the Gauchos beat down the Rainbow Warriors, thanks to sophomore Austin Bush’s performance, 14-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was scoring at a ridiculous pace early on scoring 11 runs in the first five innings of the ball game. Big performances were seen from Bush who’s two run homer in the bottom of the first inning gave his team the 2-1 lead and they never looked back.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the day Bush went 3-5 (.600) with five RBI’s, two runs, and one home run.</p>\n<p>“He was great for us.” Checketts said. “He has a great swing and he made great contact.”</p>\n<p>Despite going 1-4 (.250) on the day, Grover’s one hit was a home run that scored three runs for the Gauchos in the bottom of the fourth frame giving his team a commanding 8-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Pitching wise junior Shane Bieber (8-2) had another solid outing for his team pitching seven innings and surrendering only six hits and one run while striking out seven batters. The righty has now won eight games this season tying his career high.</p>\n<p>“Bieber was really solid game for us once again. He’s a really solid pitcher.” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend was another great one for the Gauchos. Not only in terms of breaking records but also in the fact that it did not let the sweep by Cal Poly of them a couple of weekends ago change them. This team continues to fight and grow each week and it certainly has been a fun process to witness.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday, May 3 against Pepperdine at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

He was on the floor bleeding, his eye was badly bruised, and he was immediately taken to the locker room.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-vine\" style=\"display: block;\"><iframe class=\"vine-embed\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/iPT7jlHKwQt/embed/simple\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Nobody would have blamed him if he did not go back in. Essentially, the Clippers season was over when the news broke that Chris Paul and Blake Griffin were out the rest of the series.</p>\n<p>No one had any hopes of them salvaging the series and no one believed Rivers could actually make a difference.</p>\n<p>Austin has had a difficult time earning respect in the NBA. As the former 10<sup>th</sup> overall pick, he displayed one of the worst rookie seasons by any lottery pick. The former Blue Devil was laughed at even more when his dad — Clippers Head Coach Doc Rivers — traded for him.</p>\n<p>He became a punchline for a lot of people. Not only was he a massive underachiever, but now the only coach that wants him is his dad. As you could imagine, Rivers has not had an easy career and it certainly did not get any better after going to L.A.</p>\n<p>But none of that mattered last night. Rivers was not trying to salvage his career. He was not trying to please his father. No … he was trying to do something much, much simpler: win a game for his team.</p>\n<p>What the former Duke point guard displayed was not for the “haters,” the nay-sayers, the critics or even his own father, rather, it was all for his teammates — especially Jamal Crawford — who did believe in him and knew he had it in him to make a difference.</p>\n<p>After receiving 11 stitches under his left eye, Rivers came back and certainly made his presence felt finishing the game with 21 points, eight assists, six rebounds and zero turnovers.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-vine\" style=\"display: block;\"><iframe class=\"vine-embed\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/iPtnn5hr0lv/embed/simple\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Unfortunately for him and his team, Crawford’s final chance to tie the game came up short, and the season was over.</p>\n<p>If his play did not earn him respect, his post-game interview sure did. An emotional point guard went up to the stage and what we saw was a truly authentic display of emotion from a player who truly left it all out on the court.</p>\n<p>With his eye battered, bruised and bleeding, Rivers led his team and literally bled for them to try to win a playoff game to keep their hopes alive.</p>\n<p>That is the stuff that earns you respect from all-around the league. From twitter to the people on the court, many people will never look at Austin the same and he earned that.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70532\" style=\"width: 315px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70532\" data-attachment-id=\"70532\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-30/rivers-performance-exemplifies-why-we-love-sports/nba-playoffs-los-angeles-clippers-at-portland-trail-blazers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NBA: Playoffs-Los Angeles Clippers at Portland Trail Blazers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70532\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=305%2C191\" alt=\"Damian Lillard praising Rivers for his performance Courtesy of Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports\" width=\"305\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Damian Lillard praising Rivers for his performance. Courtesy of Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports</p></div>\n<p>And that is what sports is all about.

They will now look to avenge their rough start to conference play when it takes on a solid opponent Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara won the series after taking two of three from the Rainbow Warriors but is losing the series history which stands at 17-10. However, in recent years the Gauchos have taken 10 of the last 15 games.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSB is in the midst of a 13-game home winning streak and if it can take the first two games from Hawaii it will set a new school record for most consecutive home wins, 15.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is also off to its best record at home start in school history at 17-1 beating its previous mark of 16-2 which was set in 1984.</p>\n<p>In order to pull off the upset and beat an almost unbeatable Gaucho team at home, the Rainbow Warriors will need to rely on senior star Jacob Sheldon-Collins.</p>\n<p>Currently, the shortstop has the second best batting average in the Big West with a .401, is tied for the conference leads in hits (57), and leads the team in on-base percentage (.443) and runs scored (20).</p>\n<p>He is helped by freshman catcher Kekai Rios who has the sixth best batting average in the Big West at .339. This season, the young Hawaii native has also hit a game-winning home run this season. Sophomore first baseman Eric Ramirez leads the team in RBI with 26.</p>\n<p>These great hitters will be facing off against pitcher Shane Bieber. The junior currently has a 3.30 ERA with a 7-2 record.</p>\n<p>Bieber has pitched three straight complete games with the last one being his worst after going eight innings allowing seven runs and 13 hits. He will look to turnaround his performance and hopefully tie his career high, eighth win of the season.</p>\n<p>The pitcher will also look to be helped by the great hitting staff of the Gauchos. Coming off a solid game on Tuesday is second baseman J.J. Muno.</p>\n<p>The sophomore went 2-4 (.500) with two runs scored including the game-winner in the eleventh inning. He is tied for the team lead in home runs with four on the season and currently bats .269.</p>\n<p>Another solid hitter is designated hitter/first baseman Austin Bush. The redshirt sophomore is first in RBI (26), first in slugging percentage (.475) and third in batting average (.308).</p>\n<p>This weekend will be an interesting one for the Gauchos as they will need to go back to their winning ways and make a splash in conference play.</p>\n<p>They were projected to finish fourth in the Big West in the preseason poll, however, the talent this team has and the determination it has displayed proves they have the capability to finish much, much higher.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces-off against Hawaii Friday, April 29 at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Saturday’s and Sunday’s game will be at the same location but at 2 p.m. and 1 p.m. respectively.</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this article said the Gauchos needed to sweep the weekend series to set the school record for most consecutive wins at home. The Gauchos only need to win the first two games to reach 15 straight wins, beating the previous school record of 14.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Gaels host UCSB with a 22-15 record, 10-5 conference record and have lost four of their last six games.</p>\n<p>These two teams are no strangers as they had an earlier match-up this season which saw St. Mary’s gut out a 7-4 victory after a five-run eighth inning. The loss was the first Santa Barbara had suffered this season after starting 4-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>That loss was a brutal one for pitcher Trevor Bettancourt (2-1) who came in relief in the eighth inning and allowed five runs on five hits and credited with the loss.</p>\n<p>However, the redshirt junior has bounced back mightily after that brutal 2/3’s inning of relief. Since then the righty has allowed only seven hits and one earned run in 15.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason Bettancourt had such a rough time is because the Gaels have a slew of hitters that can take it to any pitcher in the collegiate level.</p>\n<p>These hitters include players such as sophomores Zach Kirtley and outfielder Joey Fiske. The two sophomores rank first and second in batting average with .360 and .331 respectively.</p>\n<p>Kirtley is first on the team in slugging percentage (.566) and on-base percentage (.473). The infielder is also tied for first in home runs (5), hits (49) and RBI (27).</p>\n<p>Senior infielder Anthony Villa is another strong hitter for St. Mary’s as he is also tied for first with Kirtley in home runs and RBI.</p>\n<p>Junior Nate Nolan is another viable hitter ranking second in hits (41), RBI (23), and slugging percentage (.500). The catcher had a solid game last time against UCSB going 3-5 (.600) with three RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Although the Gaels are a strong hitting team, the Gauchos have their own slew of hitters that make them dangerous on any given day.</p>\n<p>They are led by sophomore first baseman Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (26) and is second in hits (35), and slugging percentage (.466). Redshirt junior outfielder Andrew Calica leads the team in hits (37) ranks second in on base percentage (.477) and fourth in batting average (.291).</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomores JJ Muno, a second baseman, and Josh Adams, designated hitter, both lead the team in home runs with four each. Adams also ranks second in RBI with a solid 23 on the season.</p>\n<p>A player who has also come on as of late is redshirt junior Devon Gradford who now leads the team in batting average (.387) and slugging percentage (.486).</p>\n<p>This weekday game will look to be a bounce back for the Gauchos. Although they are still having a solid season, being swept is never an easy thing to bounce back from especially with such a young team.</p>\n<p>One problem  facing Santa Barbara this game and the entire season is the fact that they are on the road. Currently the Gauchos are 5-9-1 away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium and have lost four of their last six on the road.</p>\n<p>This game against the Gaels is important to see not only how UCSB will respond to its three-game losing streak, longest of the season, and how it can try to avenge its loss to the Gaels earlier this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end their four-game road stand against St. Mary’s on today at 3 p.m. at Louis Guisto Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
