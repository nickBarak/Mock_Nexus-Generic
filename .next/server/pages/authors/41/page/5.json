The Anteaters are coming off a tough 8-7 loss to Long Beach State last Friday.</p>\n<p>With a win, they would have been the recipient of a first-round bye, but instead, they face UCSB, a team they have defeated two of the three times this season.</p>\n<p>The two teams first met at the Triton Invitational where the Gauchos outlasted the Anteaters 14-12 in overtime. UC Irvine would win the next two matches by a combined total of four goals, and the last meeting came down to the final possession.</p>\n<p>The main point is that these two teams while having a big discrepancy in the record, are actually pretty well-matched.</p>\n<p>UCSB certainly has a lot going for it, with its five players earning All-GCC honors being headlined by seniors Reed Cotterill and Shane Hauschild earning first and second team accolades, respectively.</p>\n<p>Cotterill, a utility, led UCSB in drawn exclusions with 25 while also adding 18 goals. Hauschild, an attacker, led the team in most offensive categories including goals (33), assists (18), steals (29) and points (51).</p>\n<p>Sophomore utility Ivan Gvozdanovic was named an All-GCC Honorable Mention despite missing the final seven contests of the season due to an undisclosed injury. At one point, he was leading the team in goals before being passed up by Hauschild. The Serbian native finished with 24 goals and 10 assists.</p>\n<p>In fact, the biggest reason for the Gauchos’ lackluster performance in conference play was the non-availability of Gvozdanovic and junior driver Boris Jovanovic. Both players were headed for career-high seasons, but injuries derailed their season as well as the team as a whole.</p>\n<p>However, if Santa Barbara proved anything last Friday, it’s that it still can beat quality teams in this conference thanks to the efforts of players like Hauschild and Cotterill, who will most likely be playing their final matches in a UCSB uniform this weekend.</p>\n<p>Even with that, UC Irvine will certainly not be an easy first-round match for any team, especially the sixth-seeded Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Irvine is led by utility Lovre Milos, who finished tied for second in the GCC in goals scored with 61. The senior was also the league’s leading assist man with 43.</p>\n<p>Milos has had a decorated four years as an Anteater, with at least 60 goals in the past three seasons and a career-high 92 during the 2014-15 season.</p>\n<p>Despite redshirting last season, the senior has not missed a beat as the league’s leading point-getter with 104 and has snatched the fourth most steals with 43 swipes.</p>\n<p>Along with the senior, the Anteaters are also confident due to the fact they have freshman phenom, Fynn Schuetze. The attacker from Hildesheim, Germany was named the conference’s Co-Newcomer of the Year after a standout 36-goal, 18-assist campaign.</p>\n<p>In the cage, senior Matej Matijevic is still one of the best goalkeepers in the league, racking up 278 saves this season, the second-highest total, and the fifth highest save percentage with a .625 mark.<br>\nHe was also an All-First Team GCC recipient.</p>\n<p>Other key notables include seniors Robby Stiefel, who went 52-10 in the sprint battles, and Kyle Trush, an honorable mention, who was second on the team in assists with 20.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos’ struggles have mostly come in the back end due to injuries, the team is certainly still talented enough to pull off a run and try to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in a long time.<br>\nLast season, UCSB was the No. 1 seed in the GCC tournament and was quickly upset, ending its hopes.</p>\n<p>This year is the exact opposite. No expectations, no pressure, no anything. Maybe this is what the Gauchos want.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on UC Irvine at 6 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 17, at the Anteater Aquatics Complex, the site for this year’s conference tournament.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 16, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Jackson was a three-year starter at Rice, while King II played in 20 games for Nevada last season after transferring from Brown University.</p>\n<p>Last season, Jackson was the third leading scorer on the team with 12.2 points per game, while his 2.3 assists ranked second best on the team. The Acton, Calif., native had season-ending knee surgery during what would have been his junior season in 2015-16, one year after averaging a career-high 14.5 points per game and leading the conference in three-point makes with 85 of them.</p>\n<p>King II averaged 3.7 points and 2.6 rebounds per game with the Wolf Pack and 12.1 ppg and 6.5 boards per match in two seasons at Brown. King II graduated from Nevada last year with a degree in business.</p>\n<p>Both players are expected to start and contribute right away to a Gaucho team that struggled in all facets of the game last season. Joining them will be a plethora of returners, including seniors Gabe Vincent, Alex Hart and Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the former, Vincent is coming off an ACL tear that ended his season back in February. Before that, the shooting guard was one of the few bright spots UCSB could count on as, before missing the final eight games of the season, he was averaging 14.8 points per game along with 3.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists per match.</p>\n<p>Despite the injury, the Stockton, Calif. native is still a well-respected figure in the Big West basketball community, as he was the only Gaucho named to the Big West All-Preseason Team.</p>\n<p>Due to his barely getting back into game action for the first time in a while, expect Vincent to have his minutes limited Saturday, as well as maybe the first few games of the season, before making a return to the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>For Canty, this is his second year as a Gaucho after transferring from community college. Like Vincent, Canty was getting better with each game throughout the season, at one point leading the Big West in rebounds, but was sidelined for all of conference play due to academic ineligibility.</p>\n<p>In 10 games last year, the big power forward averaged 10.2 points per game along with 7.0 boards. This summer, Canty has worked incredibly hard in both the classroom and the weight room, as he is eligible to play, and he has slimmed down considerably in hopes that it can help diversify his game.</p>\n<p>The last senior on the team, Hart, was one of the main threats for the Gauchos when Canty was ruled ineligible to play. Last year, Hart, who plays center, played in all 28 games for UCSB, averaging 7.6 points per contest. He was able to really improve in his final eight games of the year, scoring in double figures four times, including a season-high 16 points twice.</p>\n<p>Other notable players to watch out for will be sophomore guard Clifton Powell Jr., who was a sparkplug off the bench for the ‘Chos last season, sophomore guard Max Heidegger, who had an average slash line of 7.6/2.1/1.4, and junior forward J.D. Slajchert, who brings tremendous energy every time he is out on the court.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the court, Fresno Pacific will also be looking to improve off of an average season that saw them go 7-20 on the year but 7-13 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Recently, the Sunbirds were tapped to finish 11th in the PacWest Conference and had no players named to the preseason all-conference team.</p>\n<p>Under second-year Head Coach C.J. Haydock, FPU will look to rely on senior center Oliver Herting, who only averaged 6.5 ppg and 1.6 rebounds but is one of the few remaining members, as the team has added nine newcomers to the squad this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match won’t mean much to the Gauchos in terms of the score, as they are expected to bull over their opponent, but what will be important is how they look doing it. With many new pieces in Santa Barbara, it will be interesting to see how Pasternack could make it all work.</p>\n<p>The team has been predicted to finish sixth in the conference this season. However, if some of these additions can work, maybe this team’s ceiling is higher.</p>\n<p>First impressions are everything, and Pasternack has stated he wants the Thunderdome to be packed this season. Winning is one of the first steps he can take to ensure it is.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on FPU in an exhibition match at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 4, at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 2, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The California native has been on fire, having scored five goals and 11 points, both second-best marks on the team, over the last nine games. She scored the team’s only goal against CSUN, resulting in the 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>Along with the freshman, the Gauchos will also hope for the reemergence of senior Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>The forward started the season hot with eight goals in the team’s first 10 matches of the season, but she has fallen flat over the last five game, having not scored and being held to just two assists.</p>\n<p>Defenses have definitely been heavily pressuring the Chino Hills native.</p>\n<p>Before her five-game non-scoring streak, she had kicked one through the back of the net in four consecutive outings.</p>\n<p>Even with that, Ball’s eight goals still earns her the top spot in the Big West, along with her 18 total points. She will need to be at the top of her game against a Hawaii squad that isn’t playing great but is still capable.</p>\n<p>Last week, the Rainbow Wahine played Big West best UC Irvine and lost 3-2, meaning they won’t be such an easy win if the Gauchos don’t come out firing.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will hope to rely on leading scorer Sonest Furtado. The senior forward also leads the team in points (11) and assists (3).</p>\n<p>In reality, if Hawaii hopes for an upset win over Santa Barbara, then it will need to come out strong and fast.</p>\n<p>So far this season the Rainbow Wahine outscored 8-3 in first halves and have been shut out in six of their 13 total games.</p>\n<p>The team will need to rely upon Furtado, but she will also need help from whoever can provide it on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Wahine goalkeeper Alexis Mata has been one bright spot on a defense that has given up 17 goals this season.</p>\n<p>The junior’s 60 saves rank second best in the Big West, while her 78 percent save rate ranks fourth.</p>\n<p>After Hawaii, the Gauchos come back home with a tough test against Long Beach State, a team that has bested UCSB in its last seven meetings.</p>\n<p>LBSU defeated Hawaii in its conference opener 2-0 but has since struggled, earning a tie with rival UC Irvine and being knocked off by CSUF at home, where it had only lost once this season before, 2-0.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Gauchos, whose top goal scorers rank way above the rest of the team, the Beach has scored 16 goals on the season, but no one player has scored more than three individually.</p>\n<p>In fact, only one, senior forward Tori Bolden, has three nets this season while the next five players have two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>This has played to the Beach’s advantage, as it has consistently found the back of the net in games, being shut out in just four contests this year, including a match against No. 18 California.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, this week has become the most critical for UCSB.</p>\n<p>A slow start is not a killer, but if it bleeds into the middle of the season, then Santa Barbara has no hope of making the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>With three of UCSB’s key players being seniors, chances are they will try everything they can to right the ship and go out on top in their final season.<br>\nSanta Barbara takes on Hawaii at 10 p.m. PST on Thursday, Oct. 12, at Waipi’o Peninsula Soccer Stadium. It will then host LBSU at 1 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 15, at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

CP started out the season 0-4 before winning five straight before again becoming owners of a four-game losing streak which leads them to its 6-7 overall record.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Saturday’s game is not a must-win. However, it missed an opportunity to take a bigger lead in the conference standings with that loss to UC Davis, falling into a three-way tie for first place in the North with the Aggies and the Hornets, after they beat Cal Poly, meaning there is not much room for error with just two weeks left before tournament time.</p>\n<p>UCSB owns its Blue-Green rivalry with Cal Poly with an impressive 48-18-9 record against their fierce competitor. Normally, a record that lopsided would not give reason to support the notion this is the most impressive rivalry in college soccer, but the last few years would beg to differ.</p>\n<p>Over the last 10 years, the two squads have gone on to play some intense matches, with the record being 8-6-6 in favor of UCSB. Cal Poly is the only team to sweep the season series in the last 10 years as well, accomplishing the feat just once during the 2012-13 season. That also marks the last time CP has defeated UCSB in Harder in the past 19 years.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Santa Barbara has only won five of its ten home games over the past decade, with the last three games here at Harder Stadium ending in ties. UCSB, however, did take the victory at Cal Poly last year to win the season series.</p>\n<p>Not only has the great play helped increase the tenacity of the rivalry, but also the attendance, especially at Harder Stadium, has helped take this game to the next level.</p>\n<p>Last season’s attendance peaked at 11,424, the highest attended game in the NCAA in 2016 and in 2014, and the match reached 14, 919 fans in the Stadium, making it the second largest campus crowd in NCAA history, excluding playoffs.</p>\n<p>Getting to the game, the advantage seems to be with the home side despite the loss yesterday. Before that, the Gauchos were on fire, winning five of their last six games with their only non-win being a tie at UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Before being scored on three times by Davis, freshman goalkeeper Adam Carrillo was on a roll, allowing just four goals in his previous six starts, and earning his second Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors last week for helping the Gauchos go 1-0-1.</p>\n<p>Even taking into account the three goals against the Aggies, Carrillo still holds the best goals-against average in the entire Big West at 1.05. His 40 saves rank fifth in the conference.<br>\nAnother freshman grabbing the headlines in Santa Barbara is Randy Michael. The forward has UCSB’s most consistent offensive player leading the team in goals (5), assists (4), and total points (14). His 14 points also rank fourth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Michael is also the only other Gaucho this season to win a Big West award. He won Offensive Player of the Week honors during the week of Sept. 28, after helping the Gauchos earn two victories against conference foes with two assists and two goals.</p>\n<p>Since conference play has started, Michael has earned nine of his total 14 points in these important matches with three goals and three assists.</p>\n<p>In the five Big West games UCSB has played, as a team, it ranks second in goals (10), assists (11) and points (31) while also shooting the second-highest percentage (.15).</p>\n<p>One of the keys for Cal Poly to earn a victory at Harder Stadium will be importance of starting the game off fast. This season CP has been outscored in the first half of games 11-8, but have bounced back to outscore opponents in the second half 6-5.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but its defense needs to limit the Gauchos opportunities, which is something it has not done much of, as they’ve been outshot 181-119 over the course of the season.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will likely rely on goalkeeper Simon Boehme, whose 59 saves currently serves as the best mark in the Big West. The junior has allowed the fifth least goals in the conference, 15, and his .79 save percentage is a conference best.</p>\n<p>Boehme has also only allowed 15 goals on the season despite his team giving up the most shots. The 15 goals allowed is the fifth most in the Big West and his 1.24 goals allowed per game ranks fourth.</p>\n<p>Two players on Cal Poly’s side are tied for the team lead in goals (3). However, senior defender Adam Olsen will be sidelined during Saturday’s action due to earning a red card in Wednesday’s game.</p>\n<p>This means junior forward Sean Goode will have to try to carry the offensive flow against the Gauchos. Goode scored a goal against Sac State.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Diego Alonso will look to help his junior counterpart out as he leads the team in assists with four on the year, also tying him for the fourth best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The rekindling of rivalries is always a special time in sports, especially at the collegiate level. No matter the sport, an intense rivalry game, a roarous crowd and a great stadium are always a great recipe for a wonderful evening. Especially for the students who will look to throw their tortillas Saturday Night.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry will be renewed at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 14 at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Both Santa Barbara natives, the two Hauschild’s were used to playing with each other on the same teams in both the High School level at San Marcos and at the club level while also attending matches at UCSB’s Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>The two brothers were introduced to the sport by their younger sister who had been playing since she was 10. She is now currently a freshman at USC and is a member of the Trojans’ women’s water polo team as a driver after graduating from San Marcos High.</p>\n<p>Once introduced, Shane and Ben loved the sport and before you knew it, the Hauschild family had another connection point: water polo.</p>\n<p>“We went to try it, immediately loved it and made it our top priority so it really united all of us because we all had our different paths but water polo connected us. It definitely been a huge positive,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>“She [the sister] definitely started the water polo trend in the family and then my parents caught on, became the biggest supporters and we all then grew to love the sport immensely uniting us even more,” Ben added.</p>\n<p>With Shane being a year older, he was the first of the two to get the opportunity to go to University and continue his water polo career. In that 2014 season, Shane won the MPSF Freshman of Year after a 32-goal season while Ben led his high school team to its first league title in 20 years.</p>\n<p>What Shane accomplished his freshman year was remarkable, however, just the fact he was able to continue his water polo career at a Division-I NCAA level was incredible on its own when you consider only 2.8 percent of US High School Water Polo Players compete at NCAA I schools.</p>\n<p>Now after looking at that, it’s even more incredible to consider that the younger Hauschild was also able to get his own Division-I opportunity, opting to go to San Jose State, a school that is new to the water polo scene.</p>\n<p>“I heard it’s going to grow quickly and I could’ve gone to a more established program and do something that’s already happened,” Ben said. “Or I had this unique opportunity to come to San Jose State and work with a program, build a program and be a big name on a growing program.”</p>\n<p>After the decision was made, an even more amazing coincidence happened. UCSB, along with a few other programs, seceded from the MPSF, their former conference, and established the GCC, a conference that added San Jose State along for the ride.</p>\n<p>The move, unknowingly, set the stage not just for this Friday’s match, but last years match.</p>\n<p>Nearly one year ago to the day, the two brothers faced off for the first time ever at Campus Pool and to this day remember the feelings of that night.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous because quite honestly I didn’t know what to expect, I never had to guard him before that,” Shane said. “I didn’t know how physical it would get and I didn’t know how to go about it at all but it all went well in the end.”</p>\n<p>“It was the most anticipated match for me all season long,” Ben said. “I definitely tried to take it to another level. I didn’t want to get bested by him so there was definitely some extra adrenaline playing each other.”</p>\n<p>Not just happy that they got to play each other, Ben and Shane were also excited to be able to play in Santa Barbara, the place they grew up and the place that held all their friends and family.</p>\n<p>After the match, UCSB, a heavy favorite, came out the victor 13-7 to no one’s shock, but the brothers never shared a moment of displeasure with each other.</p>\n<p>“Even though we are supposed to be rivals I know he is still my brother. It’s more of a fun rivalry as compared to an actual competitive rivalry. We both want the best for each other,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>Even though Ben and his team came out the loser, he was never unappreciative of the fact he got to go toe-to-toe with his big brother.</p>\n<p>“I feel gratitude playing against him. I don’t feel the need to outperform him, I don’t want him to play bad or anything like that,” Ben said. “I am just trying to put on a good show and performance for my team and I know he’s going to do the same.”</p>\n<p>Like brother, like brother both Shane and Ben say playing in that Oct. 14 conference game last year at Campus Pool has been the favorite moment of their collegiate careers with both even pointing to the end of the match specifically.</p>\n<p>“Best moment was by far end of the game last year at UCSB,” Ben said. “Knowing I did my absolute best and kind of my coming out party because since then I have played my game but just playing in front of that crowd, in that pool and playing in a place I saw games at growing up was amazing.”</p>\n<p>“My favorite moment was after the game last year because we just gave each other a big hug after the match and just talked,” Shane said. “Everyone of our friends and family came up super stoked and we all reflected on the game and it was super cool.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Friday’s match, which could be the last time the two ever play each other again with Shane being a senior unless they meet at the conference tournament, both brothers are looking for the win, but even more than that, both are looking to cherish what could be the end of a fun era.</p>\n<p>“I definitely want to make the most of this game,” Ben said. “With this being the last time we could play each other I am going to go all out, hope for a good result and I think it will be a good game between us.”</p>\n<p>“This could be the last time I play him and this could be the last year I even play water polo in general so I just want to have fun and cherish being at that moment playing with and against my brother,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ben is not particularly shy about making his goal known of hopefully being able to pull off the upset this Friday. In fact, it would be his version of a perfect ending to this brotherly trilogy.</p>\n<p>“Perfect ending would definitely be beating UCSB which had been a huge motivation for me since coming here, I couldn’t ask for anything more than to score an upset over UCSB while he [Shane] is still around,” Ben said.</p>\n<p>Getting more specific, Ben added he would like a “close one-goal game in overtime with SJSU coming out the victor with me scoring the final goal over my brother and against one of my closest friends [Justyn Barrios, UCSB’s goalkeeper] to seal the win.”</p>\n<p>On the other side, Shane has never been one to tease his brother over the fact his team has gotten the better of him twice in this rivalry but he also recognizes, winning is better than losing.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to lie, I would be upset if we lost,” Shane laughed. “Not at him obviously but more so at myself and our team. He would probably rub it in to make me mad but it would also be a good memory. I would definitely want to get my revenge at that tournament at that point.”</p>\n<p>With that, Shane’s perfect ending to this trifecta would be as follows.</p>\n<p>“Perfect ending would be us coming out with a win but my brother comes out happy after a great game, then after the game, we hug it out, go get dinner with our parents and be happy.”</p>\n<p>No matter the outcome, no matter the whose version of a perfect ending comes true, no matter anything, the two brothers have made it clear that this game means more than just the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>The two have been connected for a long time thanks to water polo, and it’s because of water polo that they get this special platform to go head-to-head one more time.</p>\n<p>Cherishing the moment is more important for them than ever holding ill-will toward one another for something as simple as winning and losing.</p>\n<p>Because as far as this writer is concerned, both Ben and Shane Hauschild have already won at something much more important: happiness. A word that perfectly encapsulates the feelings this two share when they are in the pool whether it be with each other or against one another.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

team, and that means it now turns its attention to single day matches, beginning with a meeting against former MPSF rival, No. 3 Cal.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos head into this home matchup boasting an 8-4 overall record; however, they have been dropping in the national rankings due to losses to Long Beach State and UC Irvine, now ranked sixth and seventh, respectively.</p>\n<p>Cal has had another great start to the year and currently sits at 11-1. The Golden Bears came into this season as the top-ranked team in the nation after winning their 14th national title last season but recently dropped due to a 9-8 loss to UCLA at the MPSF Invitational, finishing third at the tournament. The Gauchos finished ninth in that same invite last weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>History does not bode well for Santa Barbara when facing Cal, continually one of the best programs in Division-I water polo, as it has a career record of 8-67 against the Golden Bears. The last time the Gauchos defeated the defending champs was on Sept. 17, 2004, in a 7-6 double-overtime victory at Cal.</p>\n<p>Recent history has not been so demoralizing, however, as UCSB was within one goal of defeating Cal this year and lost 8-7 at the Triton Invitation in its first weekend of action.</p>\n<p>Hoping to pull off the upset, the Gauchos will be looking to rely on their goal-scoring trio made up of senior Shane Hauschild, junior Boris Jovanovic, and sophomore Ivan Gvozdanovic.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the most experienced and the leader of the team, Hauschild has been the most consistent force for UCSB over his last four years. Over the past three seasons, the attacker has totaled 103 goals, 40 behind the 10th most in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara, Calif. native has scored 17 goals on the year, third-best mark on the team, and scored two against Cal in the first meeting this season, making him the only Gaucho to have multiple goals in that game. He leads the team in steals with 10.</p>\n<p>Jovanovic, a driver, currently is second on the team in goals with 18 and second in total points accumulated with 28 thanks to his 10 assists; he is tied for the best mark on the team with Hauschild.</p>\n<p>Gvozdanovic has been the biggest surprise for the Gauchos this year, as he has been on fire with his team-leading 21 goals on the season and 28 points scored. The utility played in all 26 games last year, scoring 24 goals and earning himself an all-conference honorable mention, but he has much improved from one season to the next, as he is only three goals away from tying last season’s mark.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the Golden Bears definitely have no lack of talent on the offensive side of the ball. While UCSB currently has one goal scorer above 20 on the season, Cal has three of them combining for 73 of the team’s total 163 goals — nearly 45 percent.</p>\n<p>Senior attacker Luca Cupido currently leads the team in scoring with 27 goals on the season, just three short of tying his entire total from last season. Despite that, Cupido made one of the biggest shots in program history as he nailed a long distance strike just before the end of the first overtime in last year’s National Championship match against USC.</p>\n<p>Last season also appeared to be an outlier for the Italian native as he scored 42 and 43 goals in 2014 and 2015, respectively.</p>\n<p>Juniors Odysseas Masmanidis and Johnny Hooper are second and third on the team in goals with 24 and 22, respectively. Hooper has led the team in goals the last two seasons with 74 in 2015 and 75 in 2016.</p>\n<p>With the invitational season finally done, this is the part of the season that will show what this year’s UCSB team is made of. Last year, the Gauchos upset No. 5 Stanford, which helped them eventually get to the No. 4 ranking in the nation, their highest ranking in the polls since 1990.</p>\n<p>One thing is for certain: If Santa Barbara wants to be taken as seriously as it was last year, especially later in the season, it needs signature wins, and what better way to do that than beating a talented program that it hasn’t bested in over a decade?</p>\n<p>No. 8 UCSB takes on No. 3 Cal at noon on Saturday, Sept. 30, at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

early goal from senior forward Amanda Ball was enough to help the Gauchos secure a close 1-0 victory at San Jose State to begin the year 2-0.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Not even three minutes into the ball game, the UCSB women’s soccer team found themselves with the early one goal lead at Spartan Soccer Complex, that was the easy part. The hard part would be holding onto that lead for the final 87 minutes of the game to keep a perfect opening weekend intact to begin in the 2017-18 campaign.</p>\n<p>It was a tough, gritty battle but after 87 minutes had passed and the final whistle blew, the Gauchos had managed to secure their second shutout victory of the season by a final score of 1-0, and now for the second consecutive season, they have started the year 2-0.</p>\n<p>The loss delegated San Jose State to a 0-2 start on the year for the first time since the 2014-15 season when it finished just 8-8-3 overall. Despite the loss, it was clear the Spartans were eager to play after losing their season opener against No. 24 Santa Clara and even more so after allowing the early goal.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

With that mark, the forward is now only one of 11 UCSB women’s soccer athletes to register at least 20 career goals.</p>\n<p>With such an early score comes the presumption that this could possibly be an easy match runs through peoples’ minds. However, San Jose State hardly made that the case. The remainder of the first half was a battle with both teams equally possessing the ball without being to put one past the keeper.</p>\n<p>However, in the second half momentum shifted towards the home side who finally started to dominate possession of the ball and the match.</p>\n<p>In its previous three games, including exhibitions, UCSB often dominated the second half outscoring opponents 7-0, but San Jose State after maybe starting out a little flat, had a new fire once the second half whistle blew.</p>\n<p>Still, Santa Barbara found a way to contest every shot and still make life impossible for the home team.</p>\n<p>In the 48<sup>th</sup> minute, senior forward Dorthe Hoppius put up a deep, hard hit ball from outside of the box but right into the steady arms of senior goalkeeper Maddie Julian who had three saves in her shutout performance.</p>\n<p>Trouble continued in the 58<sup>th</sup> minute after a great through pass from freshman Gabriella Hurtado led junior forward Jennifer Orozco just inside the box, however, Julian disrupted the play with a heads up tackle and after a mad scramble, the ball was eventually cleared by freshman midfielder Colby Parker.</p>\n<p>SJSU’s best look at the equalizer came in the 60<sup>th</sup> minute off a corner kick from the right side which landed beautifully to junior forward Darriell Franklin standing right at the edge of the box on the opposite side completely unopposed. Despite not gaining full control Franklin put up the shot which trailed just bit left giving possession back to the visitors and blowing a great opportunity to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Overall, San Jose State outshot Santa Barbara 8-3 in the second half, but with only three on goal and none actually making it past Julian, the outcome finished in favor of the visiting Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Another game that came down to a decisive goal from Amanda Ball is nothing new to Head Coach Paul Stumpf, however, a wonderful performance on the defensive end to hold tough is certainly a welcome sight this early in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is next Sunday, August 27<sup>th</sup> against UCLA. It will be the second game of a five-game road stand.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

season 2-1 against No. 24 Santa Clara. This game will be SJSU’s home opener, a place where it boasted an impressive 6-1-2 mark.</p>\n<p>UCSB holds a 5-2-2 overall record against San Jose State dating back to the teams’ first meeting back in 1995. The two squads last met in 2015 which ended in a 1-1 tie at Harder Stadium. Now junior Mallory Hromatko scored her first career goal against the Spartans in that match two years ago.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73429\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/back-to-back-shutout-losses-damper-ucsbs-weekend/shaelan-murison-runs-the-ball-towards-the-goal-christina-demarzo-daily-nexus/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-73429\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73429\" data-attachment-id=\"73429\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/back-to-back-shutout-losses-damper-ucsbs-weekend/shaelan-murison-runs-the-ball-towards-the-goal-christina-demarzo-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-16-16_7-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1590&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1590\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Shaelan Murison runs the ball towards the goal.

UCSB has outscored opponents 7-2 in the second half including scoring all three of their goals in the win against Idaho.</p>\n<p>Another consistent the Gauchos will hope to keep relying upon is the play of senior Amanda Ball. The forward scored two goals in the teams’ opener and now has 19 career goals in her career in just 41 games played. Ball also scored a goal in the teams 3-1 exhibition win over North Texas.</p>\n<p>Ball movement, in general, will also continue to be a factor for Santa Barbara as it held possession over Idaho 65 percent of the game and managed to have nine different Gauchos register a shot.</p>\n<p>Junior goalkeeper Brittney Rogers will also look to keep riding her hot streak after registering two saves in her first shutout win of the season.</p>\n<p>Despite coming off a loss, there is no doubt that the home Spartans are still riding high off a solid performance against a team that is nationally ranked.</p>\n<p>“They definitely are a team that comes to play and they have conceded very little to their opponents but they haven’t scored a ton so I think this one will be more of a chess match instead of a physical bout which suits us,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Trailing 1-0 for most of the match, San Jose finally scored the equalizer in the 51<sup>st</sup> minute courtesy of senior midfielder Yvette Cuellar’s first career goal. Cuellar, who is coming off an ACL tear, is regarded to be one of the team leaders for this years Spartans squad.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Ana Calero also played exceptional in spite of the two goals allowed in her first start of the year. As a freshman, Calero received the bulk playing time in the cage starting in 10 matches conceding 15 goals and tallying a 7-4-1 record. The sophomore had 10 saves against Santa Clara marking nearly 1/3 of her total from all of the last season.</p>\n<p>Other notable players to be wary of on the San Jose State side is senior forward Dorthe Hoppius who led the team in goals (8), shots (66), and points (21) last season as well as senior midfielder Yaritza Arista who assisted Cuellar in her goal against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>To be a successful squad, winning on the road is a necessity. Last season away from Santa Barbara, the Gauchos struggled only tallying a 3-4-2 record, however, all three road wins were against non-conference opponents. This year, fans will get a good early look to see how the team deals with being on the road, especially when faced with a road trip as long as this one.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on San Jose State at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday, August 20 at Spartan Soccer Complex. The game can be streamed on the Spartans official athletic site.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Ball seems to be in great shape to continue her great run this season as she scored one of the goals in the exhibition against North Texas. Both she and junior midfielder Mallory Hromatko were named to the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team.</p>\n<p>Ball’s fellow seniors on the team, defender Kate Shoemaker, and midfielder Chace Schornstein are all poised to have a big season and, hopefully, finish their careers with a Big West championship.</p>\n<p>“Our seniors are playing very well right now, and they will be a big part of our lineup,” Stumpf said. “They’re all playing at the top of their game and I am really excited about them.”</p>\n<p>Despite all the good news out of the Santa Barbara camp right now, Idaho will not be an easy foe for UCSB to open its’ season against.</p>\n<p>The Vandals are coming off a very successful 2016-17 campaign in which they won their second consecutive Big Sky Regular Season Championship and won 10-plus games for just the fourth time in program history.</p>\n<p>Idaho was upset in the semifinal of the Big Sky Tournament losing to Eastern Washington 1-0 after allowing the game-deciding goal in the 88<sup>th</sup> minute. It was the Vandals only conference loss of the season.</p>\n<p>2017-18 will be tougher on Idaho who is replacing its top four-goal scorers from a year ago, however, mid-season transfers junior goalkeeper Makayla Presgrave and junior forward Bridget Daley hope to make the biggest impact.</p>\n<p>“They have had a lot of success over the last couple of years as a program because they really went to work on the defensive side of things with a drop and counter conceding very few goals so I expect to see something similar to that,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>These preseason games don’t mean much to the Gauchos in terms of postseason hopes. UCSB will only make the postseason, in most cases, by winning the Big West championship.</p>\n<p>Because of that, an 8-0 start to the season isn’t necessary nor should it be expected with the tough preseason Santa Barbara has lined up for themselves, however, the lessons that can be learned in these games are very important heading into conference play.</p>\n<p>“It’s super important to build off these games and build confidence but interestingly enough, I almost feel like a loss here or there will take the pressure off,” Stumpf said. “We want to win every game we can but that’s just not going to happen especially two years in a row but we hope to have a balanced record and be as prepared as we can for Big West play.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opens its season against Idaho at 7 p.m. on Friday, August 18 at Harder Stadium. The Gauchos will be on the road for the next five matches so catch them while you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

UCSB women’s soccer team will be the first returning to the field of play as it hosts two exhibition matches at Harder Stadium this week beginning with Westmont tonight.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Of the 19 Division-I NCAA sanctioned sports on the Santa Barbara campus, the UCSB women’s soccer team will be the first returning to the field of play as it hosts two exhibition matches at Harder Stadium this week beginning with Westmont on Wednesday at 7 p.m. and North Texas on Saturday at the same time.</p>\n<p>“We are going to see two different styles from these two teams and this is good since we will face different styles all season,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We can use this as a learning tool to help learn from mistakes and really take this team to the next level in different areas. We are hopeful in the next 4-6 games we get some good experience and we will see where we go.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be looking to shake off the rust from a season ago which saw them miss postseason play despite beginning the season 8-0 overall, their first time accomplishing such a feat since 1992. After the fast start, Santa Barbara would go 3-6-2 over their final 11 matches to finish the year 11-6-2 overall and 2-5-1 in conference play earning them a sixth place finish.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“That 8-0 start probably won’t happen again,” Stumpf said. “We caught a lot of breaks early in that 8-0 start and it felt like we didn’t catch any in the last few games. But I do think it was a great experience for us to recognize we have to take one game at a time, every game is this individual entity we have to prepare for and really be opportunistic when those breaks present themselves.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of the finish last year, Santa Barbara is poised to compete for a chance at the Big West crown again due to minimal losses from a season ago, returning vets and key freshman that hope to come in and contribute right away.</p>\n<p>In terms of losses, the Gauchos are only replacing three athletes that received significant playing time in Sydney Fuentes, a first team conference letter-winner, Dakota Griggs and Savannah Francis. Even with these players lost to graduation the Gauchos return many key players integral to the Gauchos great play last year. The list of these returners is headlined by senior forward Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>Ball became a breakout star last year scoring 10 goals for UCSB, the first double-digit scorer for the program since 2005. During the eight-game winning streak, the Chino Hills native scored seven goals including her first hat-trick against Fresno St. in the teams’ season opener.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56798\" style=\"width: 548px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-soccer/wsoccer_vsucd-dustinharris-10122014-05/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-56798\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56798\" data-attachment-id=\"56798\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-soccer/wsoccer_vsucd-dustinharris-10122014-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=1600%2C1177&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1177\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1413120587\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"115\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=888%2C653&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-56798\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05-1024x753.jpg?resize=538%2C396\" alt=\"\" width=\"538\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?resize=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56798\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Senior forward Amanda Ball. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Last year, Ball also received First Team All-Big West and All-Far West honors along with 21 total points. She missed the final two games of the season with an ankle sprain, however, she seems to be fully healthy heading into this new campaign.</p>\n<p>“10 goals are a great accomplishment for anybody,” Stumpf said. “But the last thing I want is her thinking she has to score 10 goals. She has to take everything one at a time. But she has looked really good in this first week as far as her maturity level, her ability to maintain possession and her finishing. She isn’t the typical vocal leader but she leads by example.”</p>\n<p>Ball will most likely not receive much playing time in these two exhibition matches, but Gaucho fans will definitely be awaiting her play come the season opener come August 18.</p>\n<p>Other notable returners include sophomore Mallory Hromatko who was tied second on the team in goals (4) and points (10), and seniors Kate Shoemaker, an experienced defender, and Chace Schornstein who has started in 56 out of 57 games in her time as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be exhibition matches without key matchups to look out for and new freshman to admire in their fresh UCSB jersey, especially with the depth that this new team has.</p>\n<p>“There are about five spots that are really up for grabs. Outside of Chace, Kate, Amanda, Mallory, everybody else really will be in competition. We like the depth of this years’ team but we are kind of a smaller team and we will need to make adjustments when we face those big, physical direct playing teams.”</p>\n<p>“There are three [freshman] that really jump out at us. First being Christine Mauer, a really good finisher near the goal who I expect will get good minutes up front. Cate Post, a player who could play different positions for us and really earn significant minutes and Belinda Ascensio, who has not joined the team yet due to a family emergency, however, when she comes in and as long as she passes the fitness exam, we expect her to make an impact.”</p>\n<p>As for the two teams the Gauchos will be facing, Westmont, a Division-II program, was defeated by UCSB in last years’ exhibition but played excellent posting a 16-4-2 overall record losing in the second round of the NAIA National Tournament.</p>\n<p>North Texas also had a great season in 2016 going 15-5-1 with a 9-1 conference record but did not receive a NCAA bid last year despite the accolades after losing in the C-USA conference tournament final. Had it won, NT would’ve repeated as conference champs and would’ve been awarded the automatic NCAA bid. The Mean Green were voted No. 1 in the leagues preseason poll to win their third straight C-USA regular season championship.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins its exhibition season against Westmont tonight at 7 p.m. and will face North Texas on Saturday at 7 p.m. with both games being played at Harder Stadium.

The team was all smiles in the locker room until they heard the news of the tragic events that took place in I.V. that evening.</p>\n<p>“We were on the road when that happened, at Davis, actually, and we reached out to the guys not on the travel squad to make sure they were okay,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Despite the shooting, UCSB still had to play a game against UC Davis on Saturday, the final game of the three-game set. For better or for worse, Santa Barbara took the field with heavy hearts and mustered a 6-3 victory to secure a sweep of the Aggies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When the Gauchos finally came home after their win on Saturday, they didn’t come home to the same place they had left just a few days ago. The once lively campus was instead filled with sorrow and pain.</p>\n<p>Instead of being able to celebrate a sweep of UC Davis and possibly a chance at making the postseason, many of the players had to learn quickly the horrors of what had happened.</p>\n<p>Walking off the pitch after a final win of the season on Tuesday defeating USC 11-2, the UCSB men’s baseball found itself in the same place it had been three years ago.</p>\n<p>Moments before the game, the team held a moment of silence to remember the tragedy that befell UCSB. Whether it was a player, coach or someone who worked with UCSB athletics, the tragedy made them realize that changes were necessary for their own lives and beyond.</p>\n<p>“Because baseball allows these kids to have their own culture, they had a healthy distraction and each other, really, to help them cope with this,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>One of the people who did not travel with the team three years ago was Sports Information Director Andrew Wagner. An S.I.D.’s job requires them to write previews and recaps of the teams they cover while releasing any breaking news about the team in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>Wagner still serves as the S.I.D. of multiple sports, including the baseball team that he was covering at the time.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t travel with the team on that long trip, and despite having graduated a couple years back, I still lived in Isla Vista,” Wagner said. “So I was in town when this happened; I actually lived about 100 feet from the 7-Eleven where part of the shooting happened, and I just remember all the texts and calls asking if I was okay. It almost just didn’t feel real. This isn’t supposed to happen here, but it did.”</p>\n<p>Despite not being a student anymore, the event stuck around in Wagner’s mind.</p>\n<p>“It was just a night-and-day type of experience after the shooting,” Wagner said. “For a while after that, everybody just felt numb; it was weird. You just don’t imagine something like that happening in California,” Wagner said, “much less Santa Barbara and much less at UCSB where everything is more carefree, relaxed and happy.</p>\n<p>Andrew made note of the fact that this shooting was a sort of wake-up call for him, and he, like many others, tried to cope with the horrific incident that took UCSB by storm.</p>\n<p>“One of the craziest experiences I’ve had was the vigil at Harder Stadium, where both sides of the stands were packed tight but there was no noise. Everybody was so sad and in a state of disbelief,” Wagner said. “That vigil really hit close to home in multiple ways because, for a while, UCSB became known for partying and the shooting, and it made me so sad because this is such a great university and that’s not always the reputation it gets.”</p>\n<p>For Checketts in particular, a man with children of his own, this tragedy brought forth the memory of another shooting that made him re-evaluate.</p>\n<p>Checketts said. “When Sandy Hook happened, it opened my eyes. Having young kids and looking at those little faces made me sad and angry. Looking at this from our community standpoint, it was obviously scary. Isla Vista is my community. I live just around the corner. When it happens so close to home, it sure makes it a lot more real. Unfortunately, from a country standpoint, it happens so often and at such a high rate relative to other developed countries, it gets frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Since this shooting, Checketts has been involved in trying to find solutions to the current gun issue the United States faces.</p>\n<p>“There were victims in the Isla Vista tragedy that weren’t caused by gunfire and I recognize that, but as a 40-year-old man with young kids, this tragedy has motivated me to look more closely at how we handle our guns in this country. In California, we have seen some progress on this issue with some recent legislation, but more needs to be done…Families shouldn’t have to go through this kind of pain as regularly as they do in our country.”</p>\n<p>Three years later, the pain the community once felt has subsided, but it still lingers around this time. UCSB defeating USC on Tuesday wasn’t the Yankees winning the World Series after 9/11 or the Saints winning a Super Bowl after Katrina, but it was a sign that life does, in fact, go on. You can try to improve the problems we face every day, and there is beauty in that.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can completely stop bad things from happening across our country, but we have other developed countries with a fraction of the gun violence that we have and should be looking at their models and potential solutions to reduce our risk of gun violence. The tragedy in Isla Vista is another unfortunate reminder that we aren’t immune to gun violence, even in paradise.” Checketts said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The random bouts of anxiety that hit us at various moments throughout our day are something we all can relate to. Just like us regular students, most athletes that participate in Division I athletics here at Santa Barbara feel that same pressure.</p>\n<p>See, not every athlete has dreams of going pro in their respective sport. Even the few who do have that dream rarely have the opportunity to make it to the professional level coming from such a small D1 program.</p>\n<p>Now that’s not to say there isn’t an advantage to being a student athlete here at a school like UCSB. In many cases, there are a bunch of small wins that come with being an athlete, such as being able to pick classes earlier, getting some great gear and most importantly for some, a free education at one of the nation’s top public schools.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But just like in the real world, what you decide to do with your opportunity at a free education is something that will play a factor in what happens down the road in your life.</p>\n<p>Kayte Christensen is a perfect example of a woman who has taken every advantage of every opportunity given to her in life, including the sport she played for many years — basketball. During her senior campaign, she averaged 14.5 points per game and grabbed 9.1 rebounds per game leading to her winning the 2002 Big West Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Mark French was a special coach and the whole coaching staff was great,” Christensen said. “I just think my senior year especially was my favorite year just because of the group of people I was with and the human beings that were here and what we accomplished.”</p>\n<p>However, basketball was never really a part of Christensen’s life goals while she was here at UCSB. In fact, the former Gaucho always had dreams of one day living a life away from basketball.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to teach classics and be a classics professor. That’s what I studied and that’s where my focus was, and I never thought about playing professionally,” Christensen said. “I didn’t want to play overseas; I played basketball to get an education, and I wanted to continue that path.”</p>\n<p>You see, to Christensen, basketball was fun. It wasn’t her life; it wasn’t everything she wanted. To her, she saw it as an opportunity to get what she wanted: an education.</p>\n<p>“I knew with five kids in my family that if I wanted a college education I needed to provide it myself and, to me, basketball was always just a tool for that,” Christensen said. “I [am] really fortunate that basketball has shaped everything in my life, and when I look back the one thing that sticks out to me is when you want something you figure out a way to get it and basketball was a tool to get what I wanted and it all worked out.”</p>\n<p>When the final buzzer sounded on Christensen’s last game here at UCSB it seemed as though her mind was already made up to not try to play professionally. Like many athletes, her goal was achieved the day she received her degree, not the day she got drafted.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately depending how you look at it, basketball wasn’t done with Christensen.</p>\n<p>“I remember the coaching staff fighting really hard for me to even get an invite to the combine camp in Chicago, and, unfortunately, that’s one of the things about playing in a small conference … You don’t get a lot of the credit you deserve even though we were a national power here at Santa Barbara all my time here,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>Despite the effort it took just to earn her a chance at the combine, once the Lakeview, Ore. native was seen by scouts, she managed to catch the attention of a few.</p>\n<p>“Draft day — I really didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t think I was going to get drafted, and when I did get drafted by Phoenix I didn’t realize that it is really difficult to make a team,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>On the evening of the WNBA’s seventh draft since its inception, Christensen was drafted in the third round as the 40th overall selection by the Phoenix Mercury, and just like that, she had an opportunity of a lifetime fall into her lap, playing in a professional league.</p>\n<p>As with everything she had done in her life thus far, the former Big West All-Freshman did what she had done her whole life, work hard. To her credit, she did something not many people of that draft class can say, she made a WNBA roster.</p>\n<p>“I remember going through the cut process, and on the last day I went to the practice facility and I asked a veteran, ‘How do we know if we made the final roster?’ and she looked at me and said, ‘You’re here aren’t you?’ and I remember thinking how unceremonious it all was,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>“But then I realized I was one of 12 rookies to actually make a roster, even everyone that was selected in the first round [16 players] didn’t make a team, so that’s when I realized how uncommon it was that I wound up in the WNBA and I was able to play a long time.”</p>\n<p>Cut short due to injury, Christensen’s time in the WNBA lasted six years, and after that the UCSB classics graduate now had to search for a new job and pursue a new career, something that did not take long.</p>\n<p>“At the end of what would be my last season because of my injury, I went down to L.A. and did an open call with 200 other people for this position for the Kings as a halftime and post-game reporter, and I ended up getting this great job,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>That leads us to the current day, where Christensen will be inducted into the Santa Barbara Basketball Court of Champions sometime later this weekend, an honor that has been bestowed upon some of the best individuals that have come from the city of Santa Barbara, both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>“When you look at the names in that group, it’s a real big deal, an honor for sure,” Christensen said. “I think the great thing about the Santa Barbara Court of Champions is that it covers people and things that have made an impact not just in sports, but also in the community and that means a lot to me.”</p>\n<p>Christensen is a perfect example of what most of us college students want, a motor that drives us to keep grinding away until we get what we want. Of course, luck comes into play in some stages of life, but overall, what gives us opportunities is the work ethic we show on a day to day basis.</p>\n<p>Christensen was like us at one point, a college student who had no idea what she was going to do with the rest of her life. She had ideas, but like what happens with most people, life took over, and she rolled with the punches taking advantage of every single opportunity given to her and it all started with one decision, coming to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I said I have gotten lucky, but I’ve also worked my ass off. This work ethic is something I have carried with me throughout my life and they want people that have that work ethic around them,” Christensen said.</p>\n<p>“I made a very pure decision to go to Santa Barbara. Every Pac-10 [now Pac-12] school except Stanford recruited me, but I chose Santa Barbara from the Big West. I didn’t know it was a big deal, but I made it because I felt like it was a place people would care about me and what I would be in my life.”</p>\n<p>Whether you are a senior about to graduate or a freshman just finishing up your first year as a full-time student, do not panic. The same applies for student-athletes concerned with finding their niche outside the sport they’ve played for the majority of their lives.</p>\n<p>As students, we must keep in mind that being a student doesn’t define our future, but rather it is the next step toward discovering our purpose, which has no definite pathway. Work hard, and stay humble, just like our favorite forward from the years 1998-2002, Kayte Christensen.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Taking part in the very competitive NCAA Stanford Regional, Santa Barbara certainly had its fair share of struggles, finishing the competition in 11th place of the 13 teams that competed.</p>\n<p>Even though the low ranking meant an end to their season, the Gauchos certainly had a very successful 2016-17 season during which they won their first Big West title since 1998 and four other regular-season tournament championships. The five total titles are the most won in a single season in program history.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished Wednesday carding 8-over par 288, its best round at the Stanford Regional. As a whole, the team finished with a total 34-over par 874, finishing in front of Sacramento State’s 48-over par 888 and South Dakota State’s 59-over par 899.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Only four teams finished the tournament carding under par, with the winner of the Regional going to the host, Stanford, who tied for first with Baylor as they both carded 17-under 823. They will be advancing to the NCAA championship, along with third-place Pepperdine, fourth-place Oklahoma and fifth-place North Carolina, in hopes of attaining a national title.</p>\n<p>Individually, freshman Brett Bennett and junior Zach Smith each shot a 1-over par 71 in the final round to lead UCSB, while sophomore Nick Swanson finished with a 2-over par 72.</p>\n<p>Swanson and Bennett both were the highest-ranking Gauchos in the tournament, finishing 5-over 215 to tie for 33rd place out of the 75 competing athletes. Smith registered a 9-over par 219 to finish tied for 54th place. Junior Brandon Bauman finished tied for 65th with a 16-over par performance while junior Willy Moffly finished tied for 68th at 17-over par.</p>\n<p>The highest finish for an athlete from the Big West was UC Irvine’s David Kim, who finished the tournament tied for 20th place at 2-over par 212. Big West individual champion junior Felix Mory from Cal State Northridge also participated in the regional, finishing tied for 23rd after carding 3-over par 213.</p>\n<p>The winner of the Stanford Regional went to Oklahoma’s sophomore Brad Dalke, who carded a 12-under par 198 to take home first-place honors. Baylor’s freshman Cooper Dossey finished the competition at second place with a 9-under par performance, while Stanford’s senior Maverick McNealy shot at 8-under par to round out the top three.</p>\n<p>Despite the 11th-place finish, the Gauchos capped off one of the best seasons in UCSB history with all the tournament titles and individual accolades. However, the best part is probably the fact that they will return most of this starting team, and with young guys like Swanson and Bennett performing at a high level, the sky is the ceiling for next year’s team.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

postseason, let alone the College World Series, are gone, but the show must go on.</p>\n<p>With 12 games left on the docket, this team still has the opportunity to improve and finish this year strong. The first chance the Gauchos will have will be today at St. Mary’s in hopes of evening up the series against the Gaels who currently sit at 30-17 on the year.</p>\n<p>These two California squads faced off earlier this season, with SMC coming out the victor in a 4-1 decision in Santa Barbara. At that time, UCSB was ranked the No. 23 team in the country.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara and St. Mary’s both took a game in the two-match series with each team winning on the road. Hoping to have a repeat of last season, the Gauchos will look to rely on freshman pitcher Ben Brecht to get the job done.</p>\n<p>The lefty has started the last five midweek games for UCSB and has done an admirable job earning a 3-1 record with a 3.19 ERA and 15 strikeouts in 30.1 innings pitched. On the year, the southpaw has an overall 3.52 ERA with 33 punchouts.</p>\n<p>Despite having a reliable pitcher on the mound, one concern still weighs heavily on the minds of fans, and that is the fact that the Gauchos are on the road. Santa Barbara is currently 5-13 on the road and does considerably worse in the box and on the mound.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB jumps from 3.46 ERA at home to a very disappointing 6.65 ERA when on the road. It also only has a slash line of .258/.320/.399, all three considerably lower than their home marks.</p>\n<p>To SMC’s credit, it has a 17-7 home record and has won eight of its last 11 games when staying in Moraga, California.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos want to win their sixth road game of the year and show some improvement as this disappointing season ends, then they will need great performances from their young freshman.</p>\n<p>Besides Brecht, UCSB has certainly had other first-year players step into a role and thrive. The biggest example of this is right fielder / second baseman, Armani Smith. The do-it-all man at times for the Gauchos has been exceptional at the plate as he is currently tied for second in batting average with a .299 average.</p>\n<p>In his last four games, Smith has driven in four runs and is 5 for 16 at the plate while also scoring two runs. The freshman recently hit the second home run of his career in the Gauchos last series against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Sitting right behind Smith in batting average is redshirt freshman Tommy Jew. The outfielder has been tremendous on defense for Santa Barbara currently has a .980 fielding percentage, and has only committed two errors on the year. His 100 putouts on the season rank him third on the team.</p>\n<p>At the plate, Jew struggled against UC Davis registering only no hits in nine total at-bats through the course of the three-game series. However, before that, the center fielder had hit successfully in 17 straight games, something he will look to get back to starting today.</p>\n<p>Despite the rough and disappointing year, UCSB still has the opportunity to end the season in a way that it can look back and not feel so lost.</p>\n<p>The future is still bright in Santa Barbara with all these freshmen who are stepping up and juniors who will most likely elect to stay for their senior campaign. Finishing the season above .500 would certainly be a nice way to end this lackluster campaign.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on SMC at 3 p.m. on Tuesday, May 9 at Louis Guisto Field in Moraga, California.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

UC Davis is now 13-24 on the year and 5-11 in the conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Besides Nelson’s complete game performance, freshman second baseman Armani Smith also helped deliver the win on Friday going 2 for 3 with four RBI’s.</p>\n<p>“He did a really great job with two strikes,” Checketts said. “He had a really nice day at the plate and at second base.

First, redshirt senior catcher Elijah Ontiveros reached on an error by the left-hander, then Ryan Hooper was hit by Nelson’s pitch putting runners on first and second.</p>\n<p>After a bunt to advance the runners, sophomore Ryan Anderson lit up the scoreboard hitting a home run to left field for his fifth homer of the year to help his team take a 3-0 lead through three full innings.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would respond in the third inning with a four-run rally which began with a single from redshirt senior catcher Dempsey Grover who would eventually score after a sac fly from junior shortstop J.J. Muno.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the bottom of the third inning, Smith came to the plate with a bases loaded situation. The freshman delivered with a three-run double to right field making the score 4-3 in favor of the home team, a lead it would not give up for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added an insurance run in the bottom of the sixth after Muno, reached on a fielder’s choice then stole second after a failed pickoff attempt from the Aggies’ starting pitcher, redshirt junior Orlando Razo. After a throwing error which allowed Muno to take third, sophomore third baseman Tevin Mitchell brought in the junior with a groundout RBI.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final run came in the bottom of the seventh inning after Smith hit a shot past the net in left field for a one-shot home run, the second of his young career, to make the score 6-3 through seven full innings.</p>\n<p>Nelson, despite getting into some trouble in the eighth and the ninth, kept delivering the crucial outs to help his team get the victory. The junior picked up his first complete-game finish of his career and his sixth win of the season after allowing six hits, three runs, two earned, but managing to strike out six batters.</p>\n<p>“He looked tired at the end but I think it was more him being a bit too catious than anything else,” Checketts said. “When we got the lead, he got some quick outs and in the ninth, those three outs, that’s why they pay guys a lot of money to get those final outs.”</p>\n<p>One of the best things about this win was the fact that the Gauchos were able to again rally. This team has shown signs of being a winner all year but has failed to live up to its expectation. Now, maybe this entire team is ready to rally.</p>\n<p>Due to whether inclinations, UCSB and UC Davis will be playing in a double header tomorrow meaning, that the home team, with two wins tomorrow, will not only complete a sweep of a conference opponent but be .500 overall and own a winning Big West record giving them the confidence it needs heading forward.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara faces Davis at 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, May 5th at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Game two of the doubleheader will take place 30 minutes after the conclusion of the first game at the same location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
