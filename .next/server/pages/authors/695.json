He has all the trappings of a star: a legion of loyal fans, a model boyfriend and muse status in the eyes of countless fashion designers. What’s groundbreaking is Sivan’s grasp on maturity and queer identity while simultaneously producing radio-ready tracks on par with today’s brightest stars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An openly gay Australian pop sensation, Sivan took a fairly conventional route to fame. A product of his time, Sivan first rose to prominence on YouTube, accumulating millions of subscribers with his daily vlogs. By the age of 18, Sivan came out publicly in a video, which now has over eight million views. He soon transitioned from YouTube to the music industry, in typical Disney Channel star fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His first album, 2015’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Neighborhood</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, saw Sivan tackle the struggles of coming of age and coming out. The synth-pop album captures the highs and lows of adolescence, hitting all the usual boxes: unrequited love, identity issues and even the trappings of the suburbs. It’s the kind of album that could score every scene in a high school rom-com, with its highest charting single appropriately titled “YOUTH.” While the album showed the promise of Sivan’s eventual star status, its uneven pacing and crowded tracklisting reflected his rookie nature. Sivan still needed to do a little growing in order to find his true voice. Now, in 2018, Sivan is in full bloom.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, released Aug. 30, reveals Sivan as a fully defined popstar, confident in his own queer identity and powerful with his own voice. Troye rides the recent wave of “poptimism,” following the likes of Ariana Grande’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweetener </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Lorde’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melodrama</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, harnessing the fun and brightness of pop music in order to produce an album that is genuinely enjoyable to listen to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening track, “Seventeen,” bridges the gap between his first and second releases as Sivan recounts his first sexual experience as a 17-year-old. The heartbreaking song tells of Sivan being lured into a meetup with an older man on Grindr. Sivan sings of the experience from a perspective that one only gains from actually growing up as he explores the motivations of his younger self: “I went out looking for love when I was 17 / Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me.” Rather than dwell on the emotions and politics of the moment, Sivan focuses on the curiosity and loneliness that drove him to the exchange. The thoughtful retrospective captures the naivety of youth and the mistakes that insecurity and instability can cause. However, Sivan is no longer that naive, lonely, gay teen and sings from a newly found perspective of wisdom and maturity. Sivan has already done his growing and is ready to showcase what it means to be fully formed, confident and queer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MY MY MY!” does just that, following Sivan onto the dance floor, where he commands attention with ease: “Don’t make me wait another day / ‘Cause passion is passion / You know it just as well as me.” Troye alternates seductive whispers and a booming chorus accompanied by an uptempo dance-ready beat. “MY MY MY!” shows Sivan at his sexiest as he coaxes the object of his affection into his arms. The music video released with the track captures Sivan’s command of his newly found sex symbol status, as he dances fully unabridged and fully queer in an abandoned warehouse, accompanied by shirtless men.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan imbues this electrifying, bright, optimistic energy to the rest of album, which alternates ballads and bangers. The titular track, “Bloom,” finds itself on the upbeat side as Sivan not so subtly references “bottoming.” As with the rest of album, Sivan gives little worry to the binaries of sexuality and gender, speaking freely about a topic that has been given little freedom to be expressed in popular culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another upbeat highlight is Sivan’s collaboration with Ariana Grande, “Dance To This.” The two combine forces to deliver an ode to staying in rather than going out. At a time when Grande has never been bigger, Sivan manages to keep the spotlight evenly balanced between the two stars, as their angelic voices combine to create a soothing club track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan’s evolution as an artist is most obvious when he is at his most understated and vulnerable. Rather than pushing each track to emotional explosion and relying on catharsis to imbue effect, Sivan allows himself to shine in his most breathy, low-key moments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acoustic ballad, “The Good Side,” showcases Sivan’s sweetness, as the mature relationship retrospective emphasizes respect and empathy over the pettiness breakups often go hand-in-hand with. Meanwhile, “Animal,” an experimental ballad ripe with desire and longing, slowly builds until a Frank Oceanic release ends the song in euphoria.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan’s bright, fruitful and flowery imagery subverts the typical masculine pop archetype, perhaps ushering in a new era of artists who reject toxic masculinity and embrace vulnerability. Sivan produces imagery based on the queer experience; however, his masterful pop music is for everyone. Each song on the 10 track listing leaves a bright, harmonious and euphoric feeling in the ears of listeners, signifying Sivan’s rightful place among today’s hitmakers. Perhaps because of society’s slowly changing views on sexuality and gender, there has never been an openly queer artist quite so poised for mainstream success like Sivan. And with Sivan’s razor-sharp execution of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it seems like he’s more than ready to rise to the occasion.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83987\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83987\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/","id":6624,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[6623,6622,6621],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Pride Month Bangers","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-06-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rainbow-149485_640.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rainbow-149485_640.png?resize=640%2C320&ssl=1","description":"Musicians and artists have always been at the forefront of social change, and a recent wave of confident queer artists have helped usher in a new era of Pride Month jams.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah, June. The beautiful summer month in which corporate logos begin their annual wardrobe change from monochrome mundaneness to rainbow realness. While in recent years corporations have welcomed Pride Month and inclusion with open arms, Pride marches and movements stem from a history of struggle, as queer people battled for representation and acceptance in all arenas of life.

However, “Bloom,” the title track off his upcoming album, finds a much more confident and self-assured Sivan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bright pop song follows Sivan into a field of flower fueled metaphors, allusions and innuendos as he tackles the previously unexplored and unmentionable topic of gay sex. His sweet melodies and smooth voice take listeners on an intimate yet euphoric journey on a topic which has previously been ushered into the shadows. A music video, which matches the bright, colorful vibe of the track, explores both Sivan’s masculinity and femininity and questions the lines drawn between the two. The song and video shine the vibrant hues of Pride by turning a fun dance track into a vehicle for representation.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41PTANtZFW0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. “Pynk (feat. Grimes)” – Janelle Monae</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monae, a multifaceted talent, has been nominated for Grammys, has appeared in Oscar-winning films and has been deemed a fashion icon. Her decision to come out as openly pansexual this year on her album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dirty Computer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allows her to add “LGBTQ+ Icon” to that impressive list. Monae’s confident attitude and charismatic charm endows each track of the album with energy. However, “Pynk”’s artful celebration of the female existence seems especially important after Monae’s recent powerful statement of truth. Monae, a protégé of the purple man, Prince, finds her own color by imbuing pink as the color of feminine sexuality, power and desire. The romantic song manages to sound both upbeat and tender as Monae expresses desire and appreciation for women. Monae’s tongue-in-cheek lyrics create a playful dimension to this feminine, queer anthem. The song’s video, which features Monae and backup dancers dressed in what can only be described as “vagina pants,” perfectly accompanies the song’s sweet, funky vibes.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PaYvlVR_BEc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. “Supermodel” – RuPaul</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before RuPaul had “Drag Race” glued to his last name and an entire empire, he was simply America’s most famous drag queen. Oh, yeah, and a bigtime recording artist. “Supermodel,” one of the most-fun songs ever to be recorded, imbues joy into the ears of anyone who hears its banging beat. As RuPaul commands his listeners to, “Work it, covergirl,” “Give us a twirl” and “Do your thing on the runway,” his listeners actually transform into runway models, equipped with fierce poses and sickening faces. After listening to this song maybe 500 times this month, the Hadids better watch out because this writer is ready for his Vogue debut. The song preaches the same self-acceptance and confidence which the ever popular reality show “RuPaul’s Drag Race” evokes in its viewers, allowing Supermodel to be a Pride Month dancefloor staple. This irresistible track captures the energy, confidence and love Pride pushes forward.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vw9LOrHU8JI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>4. “Chanel” – Frank Ocean</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Way back in 2012, Frank Ocean became the first openly-gay major hip hop artist after he released his landmark album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Channel Orange</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While Ocean’s dreamy, velvety vocals launched him into musical stardom, his idiosyncratic lyrics have pushed him among contemporary legends. On “Chanel,” a single from 2017, Ocean is in top form, delivering verse after verse that challenges and questions societal norms of gender, sexuality and success. Ocean’s lines flow and build upon each other, creating layers of meaning culminating in heart-wrenching croons. Ocean “sees both sides like Chanel,” and can “see on both sides like Chanel,” referencing both the fashion brand’s crossed “C” logo and his appreciation for his lover’s feminine and masculine sides. The quality of art delivered by Ocean makes him the queer icon we need and deserve. Chanel gives us an opportunity to appreciate all of Ocean’s talents, and that’s something we can all be proud of.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnbsIl2BnWw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>5. “I Don’t Want It at All” – Kim Petras</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim Petras’ sugary-pop sound can only be described as a lollipop covered completely in Fun Dip. On her breakthrough single, “I Don’t Want It at All</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Petras is at maximum exuberance demanding — not asking — for all her wants and needs to be answered. If not delivered with Petras’ signature sweet and fun charisma, the song could sound flat and shallow. But with Petras in the driver’s seat, the song steers into the lane of colorful pop perfection. Petras first launched into international awareness as a young German teen fighting the German government for the right to receive sex reassignment surgery. After becoming the youngest person to ever undergo the surgery, Petras began writing songs and pursuing her dream of pop stardom. Petras’ mastery of pop signals that being trans and a popstar are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, her talent, charm and ambition proves her place in the future of pop and as a prominent figure of Pride.</span></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC9FA8lZRy8</p><div

an entirely different world than other music genres. Rap, pop, rock and electronic music have always intermingled with each other and in recent years have been increasingly intertwined as crossover hits have ruled the airwaves. We live in a post Kanye and Paul McCartney collaboration world, where Rihanna knows Tame Impala and Beyoncé was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Song. The general public has embraced this new post-genre world with one large exception; Country music remains the black sheep of the music industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest I’ve been a proud member of the I’ll-listen-to-anything-but-country club for years, which is why I was shocked when I found myself not only listening to, but enjoying Kacey Musgraves’ new release. On </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golden Hour</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, her third studio album, Musgraves takes a vacation from the strict boundaries of Nashville sonically and lyrically, exploring a new vibrant sound filled with elements of pop, funk, folk and even disco. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golden Hour</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is still undoubtedly a country album. There are all the typical allusions to cowboys, horses, and pickup trucks, sung with dixie-tinged croons. However, in Musgraves’s world, these elements seem to float effortlessly in zero gravity with rainbows, flowers and weed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album opener, “Slow Burn,” acts as a psychedelic treaty outlining the artist’s journey of spiritual enlightenment. The song begins grounded in reality as details of her early life are accompanied by simple strums of the guitar. Sonic elements are slowly added and built upon each other as she begins to muse over her laidback outlook on life. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the chorus she belts out her climatic mantra: “I’m alright with a slow burn, taking my time … I’m gonna do it my way, it’ll be alright.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time the second chorus ends, Musgraves has painted an abstract, tonal landscape atmospheres away from where she began. As she utters “whatever feels good,” her audience is floating with her in a blissful, flower-filled utopia. Musgraves is not overthinking anything, but rather slowly enjoying the simplicities of life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On “High Horse,” Musgraves’ biggest departure from her Nashville roots, she accomplishes an allusive pop-country crossover that effortlessly blends the energy of a danceable summertime radio track while still paying an authentic homage to her country roots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She fuses banjo and disco beats in a dissertation against those “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who think they’re cooler than everybody else</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” creating an irresistibly fun song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her signature wordplay and wit are in full force as she playfully delivers lines like “Darling, you take the high horse and I’ll take the high road” and “If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo,” that allow her to cut down her subjects while never leaving her realm of carefree cool. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other recent attempts at pop-country crossovers, like Lady Gaga’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joanne</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have come off as either artificial or disingenuine, taking country sentiments hostage as a mere costume to try on. Musgraves, however, mends the two genres to create her own unique musical viewpoint, which never feels forced or pretentious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sentiment is continued on the bubbly “Butterflies”, which captures the floating feelings of the beginning of love. Through a series of “winged” metaphors, she brings her audience into her chest with breathy vocals and sweet strums of guitar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chorus, “And now, you’re lifting me up ‘stead of holding me down/Stealing my heart ‘stead of stealing my crown,” continues Musgraves’s treaty of optimism, authenticity and love, which flows through each track of the record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the eponymous “Golden Hour,” Musgraves is stripped back, serenading her lover over her satisfied outlook on life. She truly captures the magic of the hour before sunset can bestow, with long, smooth, angelic vocals and a calm accompanying soundtrack creating a dreamy soundscape. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song’s nonchalant pacing and lyrics come together as she muses over her contentment, singing “And I know, I know everything’s gonna be alright.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as the sun’s golden hour paints the world in its most pleasing light, Musgraves’ blissful point of view depicts the world through a lens of optimistic enthusiasm. In a period of human history plagued with cynicism and divisiveness, the songwriter’s exploration of positivity comes as a welcoming relief.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artist’s use of modern subject matter throughout the record further cements her as the future of country. Multiple references to marijuana and psychedelics spread throughout the album reveal Musgraves’ commitment to honesty and artistic expression. Rather than shy away from subjects which could alienate country fans, she paints her world without censure. While she has already established herself as firm advocate of LGBTQ+ rights, her commitment to queer imagery has made her a queer icon. Songs like “Rainbow” and “High Horse” have resonated with queer audiences and have introduced to these audiences to a genre which is not always welcoming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Country music has always been obsessed with freedom, yet it has always placed strict musical and thematic boundaries on itself, which has tethered the genre to the past. By superseding these limitations, Musgraves captures a new aspect of freedom, which is often overlooked by her contemporaries. Kacey Musgraves may have broken the rules of country, but she’s too content and self-assured to care.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82444\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/kacey-musgraves-brings-country-to-the-modern-age-with-new-album-golden-hour/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82444\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/kacey-musgraves-brings-country-to-the-modern-age-with-new-album-golden-hour/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/kacey-musgraves-brings-country-to-the-modern-age-with-new-album-golden-hour/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/kacey-musgraves-brings-country-to-the-modern-age-with-new-album-golden-hour/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/kacey-musgraves-brings-country-to-the-modern-age-with-new-album-golden-hour/","id":6658,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[6657,6656,6655],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Big Sick’ Writers Uncover Their Roots at Script to Screen","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23BIGSICK1-master768.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23BIGSICK1-master768.jpg?resize=768%2C450&ssl=1","description":"The Big Sick champions the romantic comedy genre, delivering humor, heart and reality while simultaneously staying true to its roots.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In an early scene in “The Big Sick,” Kumail Nanjiani’s character reveals an embarrassing high school portrait, complete with dramatic swooping bangs and an angst-ridden stare at the camera, both accredited to the character’s adoration of ’90s rom-com legend, Hugh Grant.</p>\n<p>While <em>The Big Sick</em> shares a genre with the traditional romantic comedies that catapulted Grant to fame, the film exists on a completely different emotional and theatrical playing field. The film, based on its screenwriters’ own true love story, weaves a clash of cultures, medical mystery and search for identity with the classic boy-meets-girl formula to produce a story both grounded and comical.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 3, the Carsey-Wolf Center welcomed Academy Award-nominated screenwriters, Emily V. Gordon and Nanjiani to the Pollock Theater as part of their Script to Screen series. After a screening of “The Big Sick,” the pair, who have been married since 2007, sat down with Pollock Theater director Matthew Ryan to discuss the film’s script. The film has experienced extraordinary financial and critical success, becoming the most successful independent film release of 2017 and amassing countless awards, including an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nanjiani, best known for his starring role in HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” also stars as the film’s lead character, a fictitious version of himself. The character is a stand-up comedian torn between the expectations of his traditional Pakistani family and his love for Emily, an American psychology graduate student played by Zoe Kazan. The plot thickens when Emily ends up in the hospital with a mysterious illness, which results in her being placed in a medically induced coma. Emily’s coma marks the arrival of her parents, played by the legendary Holly Hunter and Ray Romano, who challenge Kumail’s issues of identity and vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The pair revealed that creating the film’s script from their own story was not always an easy process. They first created a “puke draft” which consisted of 164 pages of raw, unstructured story drawn from their personal experiences. Gordon explained that adapting this version of the script would be impossible as it contained too much detail and would not translate well onto screen.</p>\n<p>“Real lives are boring,” she said “It’s the structure which makes a story interesting.”</p>\n<p>Slowly, over the course of three years, the couple edited down the story, creating a solid narrative comprised of what felt relevant to them.</p>\n<p>As they got further along in the writing process, the couple realized that some moments of their own story, which initially seemed important, did not entirely fit into the film. The duo did not mind changing or embellishing the truth, as they were not aiming to create a biopic, but the best story they could possibly tell. Gordon and Nanjiani did, however, try to sneak personal anecdotes into the film, like Kumail’s love of “The X-Files” and Emily’s favorite brain T-shirt, for example.</p>\n<p>Nanjiani noted that it was important to create a flawed when attempting to mirror himself. He explained that oftentimes when individuals are involved with the production of their own stories, the stories morph into vanity projects, portraying themselves as perfect and idealistic.</p>\n<p>“Why would I want to play someone who doesn’t grow by the end of the story?” he asked.</p>\n<p>The writing process also proved to be somewhat introspective. Nanjiani found that writing scenes based on his own family dynamic allowed him to see his parents’ perspective more clearly.</p>\n<p>On crafting characters in general, the pair elaborated that their main goal was for the audience to thoroughly understand all their characters. “</p>\n<p>You’re supposed to understand the character’s viewpoint but not agree with them,” Gordon said. “Nobody’s right, nobody’s wrong. Everyone just has different opinions.”</p>\n<p>This empathetic dogma brings layers of warmth and credibility to the film, as each character is given a sincere viewpoint rooted in genuine emotions.</p>\n<p>Portraying a real relationship was also of high importance to the screenwriters. Gordon explained that while she is a fan of romantic comedies, the relationships depicted in them kind of just fall rigidly into place. People are “more resistant” to love in real relationships.

Clad in a camo suit and a shirt emblazoned with a mountain scene, JT touted his new hipster-meets-mountaineer persona, which has accompanied his recently released (and not very good) album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Man of the Woods</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The choice of Timberlake as singular ringleader of the biggest entertainment event of the year has left many baffled, as his only memorable track in recent years, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” is from the soundtrack to “The Trolls” — an animated children’s film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timberlake is an undeniable entertainer, but has more recently shined greater on stages like “Saturday Night Live” than in concert venues. While relevance is not a prerequisite for halftime supremacy, usually only artists with legendary status can pull off a show without it (see Madonna’s 2012 show). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make matters worse, Timberlake’s history with the Super Bowl, 2004’s</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nipplegate,” set the stakes for the show very high. A Prince hologram, which went against the music legend’s wishes, was also rumored to make an appearance. Timberlake needed an extraordinary spectacle that could take his audience out of this world, but he only delivered a low-energy performance which lacked the transformative powers the Super Bowl halftime show is known for. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a list of five artists who could have delivered that energy and put on a more relevant and compelling show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rihanna </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Rihanna has not performed at the Super Bowl seems almost sacrilegious at this point. Rihanna has continually proven to be one of this generation’s most compelling performers, and with 14 No. 1 singles, she has an endless catalog of songs to perform. Despite not releasing an album since 2016’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Rihanna was still 2017’s most-streamed female artist on Spotify. Her feature on DJ Khaled’s “Wild Thoughts” was compelling enough to earn the DJ a performance at the 2018 Grammys. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I repeat</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rihanna got DJ Khaled to the Grammys. There’s no doubt Rihanna could have brought the star power and energy to the Super Bowl that Timberlake lacked.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQWqksdE4gw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kendrick Lamar </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After an amazing 2017 following the release of his critical and financial powerhouse </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAMN.,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> there could be no artist more relevant to perform at the Super Bowl this year than Kendrick Lamar. His headlining performance at last year’s Coachella and performances at this year’s Grammys, College Football Championship and VMAs all prove his ability to deliver a high-profile, awe-inspiring show. In 2018, Kendrick has already dropped three massive singles from the “Black Panther” soundtrack, which he is producing, giving him more than enough new exciting material to perform, not to mention the potential for guest appearances from The Weeknd and SZA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kendrick, the complete opposite from apolitical and stagnant Timberlake, could deliver a performance which would not only recognize the recent shift towards rap in pop music but also deliver a relevant statement on the state of America, one the NFL would be wise to listen to.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cziv-WGRLcE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P!nk </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P!nk, who performed Sunday’s national anthem (under the duress of the flu no less), is a pop star who has stood the test of time. Her music catalog has spanned almost two decades, and she continually cranks out hits, including this year’s “What About Us.” While a figure from Timberlake’s time at the charts, P!nk has continued to stay relevant and has managed to keep churning out a fresh sound. Plus, her passion for high-flying acrobatic performances would no doubt excel in a giant stadium venue.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2woDr_ozkU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drake </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who doesn’t love Drake? Serving as our generation’s resident sad boy crooner, Drake knows how to keep America entertained. While not always the most innovative artist, there’s a reason Drake can release near identical songs year after year and still make it into our playlists. He’s got a formula and it works. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His recent surprise release EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scary Hours,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has already produced the No. 1 single, “God’s Plan,” which has already situated itself as the anthem of 2018. Drake’s voice is enough to unite America, and a Super Bowl performance that coincided with his newly released tracks would generate unfathomable hype that would energize any crowd — something JT just could not do.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0uiw4xE7Cs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janet Jackson </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as Timberlake was announced as the halftime headliner, an uproar was sent throughout the musical universe. At the 2004 halftime show, as JT and Jackson finished the show to Timberlake’s recent hit “Rock Your Body,” Timberlake tore off a segment of Jackson’s costume, which led to the infamous wardrobe malfunction, Nipplegate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the aftermath of the incident, Jackson’s career suffered as the media allocated her with almost all blame, while Timberlake’s career escaped unscathed. Fans on Twitter acknowledged the incident and supported the music legend by tweeting #janetjacksonappreciationday on Sunday. In the context of the recent #metoo and #timesup movements, an appearance by Jackson would be a timely statement on the systematic biases which women are subjected to, and a moment of redemption for a music legend. Both would offer more excitement and spectacle than Justin Timberlake’s tepid voyage through his musical catalog.</span></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzC78pNk0MM</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80883\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80883\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/","id":6673,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[6672,6671,6670],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/695"}},"__N_SSG":true}
