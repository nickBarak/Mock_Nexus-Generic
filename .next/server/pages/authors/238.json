The app calculates the number of students active on each floor and is constantly updated, refreshed every 10 minutes. It is 90% accurate, according to the app’s website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Waitz app is currently only available for iOS download, but Android users can still access occupancy rates online through the library’s website. Librarians have promoted the app through their website, UCSB’s subreddit r/UCSantaBarbara and on special monitor screens that display the occupancy rates in the library. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developer of Waitz and former UC San Diego alumni, Max Topolsky, first thought of creating an app that could monitor occupancy when he was a senior at UC San Diego. The app first launched at UCSD in August 2017, making UCSB the second UC to use Waitz’s services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We developed this when we were students at UC San Diego, and [at] UCSD we have a really big library and walking around when it was crowded was always a pain,” Topolosky said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So myself and two other people thought that … we can actually do something, so we started experimenting with some different technology and we found something that actually worked,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The library has been searching for products to help students with space occupancy and the library’s head of communications, Hanna Rael, shared that she has been approached several times by students “looking for some way to see online how busy the library is at any given time”; so, when she “received a direct email from Waitz,” she felt “super excited about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The librarians are also using the data collected by Waitz to understand why certain floors are used more than others and to find ways to improve the use of floors are utilized at lower rates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll be able to see historical data about space occupancy … [and] we can see if there’s parts of the library that over time seem underutilized and that might point to other issues that we could look into. Like maybe there’s not enough power in that area, maybe there’s not enough light or maybe the temperature control is not good in that area,” UCSB librarian Rebecca Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Waitz app is currently only used at the library, but plans are in place to expand to other locations around campus in the future, Metzger added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If students like it, we will probably be looking at ways to see if we can share the funding with other partners on campus who are interested in seeing it continue after the first year.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90611\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90611\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/new-app-allows-students-to-check-library-floor-occupancy/","id":1878,"author":{"id":238,"name":"Crystal Martinez"},"related":[1877,1876,1875],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/238"}},"__N_SSG":true}
