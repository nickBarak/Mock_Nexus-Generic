focused on the speakers’ ideas for a movement from a two-state solution to a focus on smaller-scale initiatives for peace. The discussion centered on the notion that for the two countries to reach a definite resolution, they must first create trustworthy relations through the reconciliation and realistic negotiations.</p>\n<p>Makovsky is an adjunct professor at John Hopkins University’s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. He is the co-author of Myths, Illusions, and Peace: Finding a New Direction for America in the Middle East and frequently contributes to the New York Times, the Jerusalem Post and Foreign Policy. Makovsky served as a Senior Advisor to U.S Secretary of State John Kerry during the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations of 2013 and 2014.</p>\n<p>Al-Omari formerly served as the executive director at the American Task Force on Palestine. Al-Omari has worked extensively within the Palestinian Authority, with roles including director of the International Relations Department in the Office of the Palestinian President and advisor to former Palestine Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas. He also played a key role in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process as an advisor to the Palestinian negotiation team throughout 1991-2001. He participated in negotiations leading to the Camp David Accords and the Taba Summit.</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, both countries must wholeheartedly try to negotiate toward peace.</p>\n<p>“[An] all or nothing approach tends to be nothing,” Makovsky said.<br>\nMakovsky said current leaders are facing challenges as they try to work with a generation that “wasn’t even born when the handshake happened,” referring to the Camp David Accords.</p>\n<p>“Objectively difficult leaders that are risk averse are left with the toughest work ahead,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68606\" style=\"width: 786px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68606\" data-attachment-id=\"68606\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/international-experts-join-to-discuss-palestine/paradigm2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?fit=2285%2C3015&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2285,3015\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"paradigm2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?fit=189%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?fit=776%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68606\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2-776x1024.jpg?resize=776%2C1024\" alt=\"Ari Plachta / Daily Nexus\" width=\"776\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?resize=776%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?resize=189%2C250&amp;ssl=1 189w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?resize=768%2C1013&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68606\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ari Plachta / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Makovsky said a critical part of the issue is the lack of compromise.<br>\n“Instead of sharing opinions, they reflect them,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Al-Omari said in order to believe progress is possible, Palestinians must see progress in their daily lives.</p>\n<p>“From a security point of view, Israel can take more measures in the West Bank that will give the Palestinians breathing room,” al-Omari said.</p>\n<p>He also said he believes a “rehabilitation of the P.A. [Palestinian Authority]” would support a new paradigm that shifts toward progress.</p>\n<p>Makovsky said he hopes it is possible to shift away from the current five negotiation points of water, settlement, Jerusalem, mutual recognition and security because he believes the “five for five” deal is too absolute.</p>\n<p>“I think what you would do is — this new paradigm, when you want to flesh it out — is to say ‘okay, we’re not going to do the five for five. We’re not going to get the grand deal on all five issues,’” Makovsky said. “‘But we’re going to single a direction towards the two states, maintain a viability.”</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, Israelis need to see less of a military presence in order to feel safe.</p>\n<p>“The army would stay exactly where they are. Of course they’d have less of a footprint because they’d have to protect less people, but I think for the Israelis living in Jaffa, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other cities — all they want is to be safe,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Makovsky said Israeli citizens want their government to be honest in explaining the country’s situation.</p>\n<p>“All they want is their leaders to tell them, ‘If I make gestures to the Palestinians, am I more secure or am I more vulnerable?’ That’s all they care about,” Makovsky said. “I think they’d care less if some small settlements outside of Nablus stay exactly where they are.”</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, there needs to be a distinction between ideology of safety and individual safety.</p>\n<p>“So, what you’d be doing is decoupling these two issues and signal a new direction — tell the Palestinians you want them to have their own space, but because the region is a meltdown, you’re not going to pull the army out,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Julie Alexander, fourth-year psychology major who attended the talk, said she heard about the event through Facebook and was interested to hear from individuals who have played key roles in international policy.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the time, all we get is media coverage,” Alexander said. “To hear the reasons why from a source closer to the issue is a really special opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Kimberly Ruiz, fourth-year global studies major, said she believes discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict from a new perspective could lead to a solution.</p>\n<p>“The discussion has the possibility to bring out new ideas,” Ruiz said. “Shifting the way a problem is approached can make some change.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily

soldiers on Tuesday as part of a nationwide tour put on by the organization StandWithUs.</p>\n<p>The Israeli Soldiers Tour program enables reserve duty Israeli college students to share their experiences as ordinary Israeli citizens, their views on the Arab-Israeli conflict and their personal stories to reveal the individuals behind the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). The tour has travelled throughout the U.S., visiting colleges, high schools, synagogues and churches.</p>\n<p>Danielle Cohen, third-year film and media studies and sociology double major, said the discussion provided a first person account of the experiences of the Israeli soldiers.</p>\n<p>“It’s really cool to get first hand experience from the Israeli soldiers’ perspective, especially because we spend so much time learning about Israeli policies in conflict. It’s really insightful to hear from them,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Eidan Shalom said he was interested to hear from IDF soldiers firsthand about their experiences.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a cool opportunity to speak to the people that are actually there. Primary sources, rather than what we hear on the media,” Shalom said. “Hear from the people that see it — that live it.”</p>\n<p>Both guest speakers chose to share only their first names with the audience, as there had been angry comments posted on social media concerning members of IDF coming to speak.</p>\n<p>Gilad, 27, spent six years in the IDF as a paratrooper and later as part of the Intelligence Corps. He said the media does not effectively portray the experiences of soldiers in Israel.</p>\n<p>“We say in Israel we don’t always have a choice on if we want to fight or not, but we do have a choice on how we fight,” Gilad said. “This is one of those things you won’t hear about in the news because you really don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>Edan, 28, was with the ground combat division. He is pursuing a PhD in a program involved in researching heart regeneration to help fight against heart attacks. According to Edan, the purpose of the tour is to inform the public about the plights of Israeli soldiers in order to counter media sources that misrepresent them.</p>\n<p>“[I] could go on and on about my research, but that’s not why I’m here. My heart, and Gilad’s as well, is under a different kind of attack. In saying that I mean we hear and we follow what goes on around the world,” Edan said. “Sources change all kind of acts and makes all of these accusations about us towards Palestinians. And this is very tough for us and very frustrating. And that’s why we’re here, going around and sharing our personal stories and giving people the opportunity to listen to real stories without anyone changing it in the process.”</p>\n<p>Gilad said he became involved in the Israeli army because he felt it was the best thing he could do for himself.</p>\n<p>“I know we come and we talk and parts of the army might sound cool. But it sucks. But you really do it because you understand that this is the most important thing you could be doing with yourself right now and it is for me,” Gilad said. “And you ask what you get from the army? And for me, it’s a sense of proportion.”</p>\n<p>The Israeli Soldier tour is in its first session, traveling around the Southern United States. A second tour will begin in mid-April touring the Northern states.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

id=\"caption-attachment-68110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Black South African activists Jamie Mithi and Khanyisa Pinini discussed their views on labeling Israel an apartheid state in an event hosted by Gauchos United for Israel on Tuesday in the Isla Vista Theater.</p>\n<p>Mithi, originally from Zimbabwe, is an author and law student at University of the Witwatersrand Johannesburg. He is an avid debater, ranked fourth globally and first in Africa in the World Universities Public Speaking Championship. Pinini, originally from Johannesburg, has been heavily involved with student leadership at University of Cape Town (UCT) and is a member of the United Nations Association of South Africa: UCT Chapter and has participated two times in national Model United Nations conferences.</p>\n<p>Mithi and Pinini both shared their personal experiences with apartheid in South Africa and how their own narratives informed their definitions of the term “apartheid.” Both said they used to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement, but withdrew their support after visiting Israel. The two speakers said they have felt a loss of Black South African apartheid narrative due to the use of the term to label Israel when referring to conflict with Palestine.</p>\n<p>Mithi first proposed that a major difference between an apartheid state and the status of Israel is historical context. In the context of debate, he presented the claim that Israel is a colonial-settler state, then refuted this idea by stating there cannot be a colonial-settler state if said settlers already existed within an area.</p>\n<p>“It is a non sequitur for us to claim that people who have always had a presence in a particular area, are colonizers of the area if they’ve always been there,” Mithi said.</p>\n<p>The second level of Mithi’s argument focused on the legislative structure of apartheid versus that of the state of Israel. He said apartheid law’s “four levels of existence,” which are based upon racial discrimination, are “just not the way it is” in Israel’s legal system.</p>\n<p>“In Israel, all Israeli citizens have the same rights,” Mithi said.</p>\n<p>This difference in citizen rights is what he argues sets apartheid and the Israeli state apart.</p>\n<p>His third level of debate focused on the context of the area. He said conflicts in the surrounding areas of Israel are what “led to the conflicts in the West Bank.” This war-zone environment is another factor, according to Mithi, that sets true apartheid apart from the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>\n<p>“It would be complete false argumentation and academically insincere to say that’s apartheid,” Mithi said. “The reality is, what I’m talking about, the scenario of ‘peaceful neighbor,’ where I’m talking about a scenario where the neighbors aren’t seeing eye to eye, right?”</p>\n<p>In his closing statement, Mithi said when discussing Israel-Palestine conflict, neither side should vilify the other.</p>\n<p>“There is a problem in Israel [and] Palestine, and largely in the Middle East. And I don’t think that the tactic of demonizing the other side leads to the relevant solution,” Mithi said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68109\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68109\" data-attachment-id=\"68109\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/activists-discuss-israel-apartheid-state-label/apartheid_by-spencer-brandt-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Apartheid_by Spencer Brandt-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68109\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Apartheid_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Michelle May, a second-year biology major, said she was impressed by Mithi and Pinini’s expertise.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t come here expecting anything, I found it really interesting to hear [about the conflict] from a South African point of view, coming from a family that has experienced apartheid,” May said. “And they’re obviously really educated about both topics.”</p>\n<p>Event organizer Kayla Shenassa, a second-year classics major, said the event exceeded her expectations.</p>\n<p>“It was really great to see the number of people that came out to an event like this.

The event was put together as a collaborative effort between the Chainsmokers and a new app called Tilt. Campuses were challenged to pre-sell 800 tickets and the first six schools to do so won a spot on the Tilt Tour. The headliner of the show wasn’t announced until 24 hours before tickets went on sale. UCSB managed to sell out the first round of tickets in less than an hour and half, and the second release in under a minute.</p>\n<p>Tilt is an app that makes it easy to collect money without all the hassle. Basically, a user starts a Tilt campaign with a set “Tilt amount.” Others donate whatever sum they choose, but nobody gets charged until the goal is hit. It’s like Venmo on a Costco-sized scale. The appeal to college campuses is obvious. Whether it’s a party, a trip, philanthropy or day-to-day housing costs, Tilt can make any type of organizing as smooth as can be. Overall, this Tilt campaign managed to sell more than 4,800 tickets in less than two hours, a clear example of the app’s accessibility and efficiency.</p>\n<p>The event itself was a huge success. The crowd managed to fill up the hall regardless of the early show time. Set times were strictly adhered to, and security was very efficient. The opening act vibed well with the excitement of the audience and paved the way for the headliner. Austin Graham, fourth-year chemical engineering major, told me he’s seen The Chainsmokers more times than he can count, but “they still manage to get me ridiculously hyped every time.” During the set another concert go-er, fourth-year economics major Chris Mulvihill, told me that he’s “so glad he skipped studying to come see this event.” Chainsmokers over midterms erryday, amirite?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Crowd-funding concerts and tours might be the future of how artists tour. Earlier this year, <em>The New York Times </em>published an article discussing the feasibility of saving musicians revenue with the emergence of prominent streaming services such as Spotify or SoundCloud. A cost of touring that is often overlooked is the wear and tear such a hectic schedule takes on the artists themselves. <em>The New York Times </em>discusses how unsustainable of a business model touring is for artists, especially when record label contracts are considered. Record labels use artist’s independent contractor statuses to release themselves from liabilities pertaining to the well-being of the artist.</p>\n<p>The changes happening in the music industry force artists to adapt. In an interview with <em>The Rolling Stone</em>, Foo Fighters front man Dave Grohl said that crowd funding might be the future of how artists plan their tours. The Foo Fighters had to cancel a huge part of their 2015 tour due to an injury Grohl sustained while performing. <em>The New York Times </em>reports that the canceled shows cost the band about $10 million — a sum that is very difficult to recover. An alternative needs to be found to sustain the music industry. The Chainsmokers see things similarly. The duo told Tilt, “We are seeing so much innovation nowadays, and we don’t think the way people attend concerts is any different. As artists especially, we want to go to the markets we have the most demand.”</p>\n<p>Another reason The Chainsmokers might have been attracted to Tilt could be how both Tilt and the dynamic duo relate to fans. Tilt works solely on fan involvement, and The Chainsmokers are known for creating a close relationship with their fan base. They almost always join the after party, discuss fan encounters on their Sirius XM show “Nice Hair” and are known to retweet and respond to fans online. Oh, and we can’t forget their beautiful puppy, Cheddar. (Follow him on Insta @cheddarsaycheese. Seriously. You won’t regret it.) For artists like The Chainsmokers, a form of touring that cuts out the middleman is clearly superior to the old school touring model.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how the emergences of crowd funding changes the way artists do what they do. The possibilities are endless.

The group is comprised of Chicago natives Jake Carpenter, Louis Kha and Mikul Wing. The three members all hail from unique backgrounds that we don’t always see in the EDM world. Carpenter has an educational background in sculpting and painting with a work history that involves weapons development and underwater robotics for the Department of Defense in Kentucky. Kha worked as a derivatives trader during the workweek and a DJ on the weekends with Wing. Wing did street art and deejayed a lot of underground loft parties. The three came together about a year ago over a mutual love for all things art and discontent with their day-to-day routines.</p>\n<p>The group’s first project together was a recreation of Warhol’s factory concept with their own personal spin. They built sculptures and created a broiler room-esque atmosphere for the event. Manufacturing their own genre, set and effects is something the group is determined to keep doing. Following their first project together, the group released a string of remixes of hits that range all the way from Marvin Gaye’s “Grapevine” to 50 Cent and Lil Kim’s “Magic Stick.” Their first single, “Dream,” released about a year ago, has 2.53 million hits on SoundCloud and paved the way for the group to continue releasing original content.</p>\n<p>Autograf dropped their single “Future Soup” a couple days ago. The track is from their EP, also titled <em>Future Soup, </em>which is set to release independently on Mar. 11. In an interview with <em>Billboard</em>, Autograf said, “<em>Future Soup</em> is our calling to everyone to weave their own story, to make their own metaphorical art series, whatever that may be.” It is a continuation of the trio’s attempts at creating their own sound that sets them apart from the rest of the future house movement. They hope to break away from the mainstream sounds prominent in the EDM genre. The entire Autograf project is geared around the hashtag “#leaveyourmark,” and the slogan, “It’s about leaving your mark on the world. It’s about leaving your Autograf.” These artists don’t want to just entertain — they want to inspire. Their goals aren’t limited to just music, either. The group continues to build their own sets and bring their own visual designs to their live performances. The entire project is self-created and stays away from manufactured performance and production.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>SOhO is a mid-tour stop on their North American tour titled the “Metaphysical Tour.” The tour is set to end right as their EP drops, so there is a slight possibility of getting to preview some new tracks at their performance. The show is put on in part by SELECT Entertainment, a company that has had major success and took part in bringing other EDM artists such as Ghastly, SBRN and Shiba San out to Santa Barbara. The event is 18 plus, with doors opening at 9 p.m. Early Bird and Tier 1 are already sold out, but Tier 2 and Final Round sales are still available. They can be purchased through NightOut ticketing.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Fu8fZlq30</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/autograf-to-come-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/autograf-to-come-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/autograf-to-come-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/autograf-to-come-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/autograf-to-come-to-soho/","id":6831,"author":{"id":122,"name":"Sohila Sandher"},"related":[6830,6829,6828],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ghastly, Local Acts Make Sunday Funday @ SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pokemans_092.gif?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pokemans_092.gif?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Swarms of drunken Isla Vistans descended upon SOhO Restaurant and Music Club Sunday night to jump up, down and all around to the show SELECT Entertainment and We the Beat lined up.

Individuals who normally show up 20 minutes late to their 11 a.m. classes actually arrived to the venue on time in order to support local artists Bucketz and DJ Prodijay. The venue was filling up long before Ghastly was set to go on stage.</p>\n<p>After some slight hassle and wait time to get into the venue, most of the crowd went directly to the bar. Bucketz was able to lure thirsty college students away from their tequila shots and over to the stage with some tasty house tunes. The dance floor was “lit af” and he was only half way done with his set. His support wasn’t only from locals either. I managed to talk to some folks from Santa Monica and Oxnard who told me they were glad they showed up in time to see the opener and couldn’t wait to find him on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>DJ Prodijay kept the hype building for Ghastly with his own blend of house. More and more people were entering the event and gravitating directly over to the stage, a tribute to Prodijay’s mixing. The demographics of the crowd made it feel like Isla Vista had literally taken over SOhO and decided to make it into the greatest house party.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Unfortunately, I spent most of Prodijay’s set waiting in the cursed bathroom line, making bathroom-line friends that I’ll probably never see again. By the time I got out and back on the dance floor, Prodijay was wrapping up his set and SOhO was the most packed I’ve ever seen it. When Ghastly finally came on in the late hours of the night, the crowd was well past drunk and very, very hyped for the headliner.</p>\n<p>Ghastly’s set had all the components of catering to a crowd that was as energetic as any Sunday night. He dropped some nasty beats and paired them with colorful visuals that combined to turn the house party into an all-out rager. Audience members were getting low and pushing around so much that I had to take a step back and watch from the safety of the sound booth corner. Frat dudes lost their shirts and girls ended up on shoulders for the ‘gram — a true sign of a performance well done.</p>\n<p>With the show done, audience members reluctantly left the venue in search of their Ubers and after parties to continue the great experience at SOhO. I managed to snag a spot on a random bus that had no intentions of turning down anytime soon. Seeing local artists build such a great atmosphere for an up-and-coming artist like Ghastly is something I hope to see more of in the future. Kudos to all those that contributed to making that Sunday one for the books, y’all crushed it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67593\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67593\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/","id":6817,"author":{"id":122,"name":"Sohila Sandher"},"related":[6816,6815,6814],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/122"}},"__N_SSG":true}
