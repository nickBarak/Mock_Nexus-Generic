Had fun coloring flower pots and standing in line for vegan ice cream amidst a dazzling bunch of barefoot hippies? Earthing (walking barefoot everywhere at all times for a closer spiritual and physical connection to Mother Earth) is one of those trends that provokes either love or hatred. One might go as far as to say that nothing has incited as much  Gaucho trash talk since the debate about the correct pronunciation of our favourite cafe.

Everyone says bare feet are more prone to infections, but no one thinks about the detrimental health effects of shoes (unstable ankles and joints, blisters and deformed feet). Researchers are now </span><a href=\"https://dermalmedix.com/walking-barefoot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">saying </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that earthing may be just as good for your body as it is for your spirit. Yet, for most of our generation, shoes seem to be first and foremost about style rather than comfort, let alone orthopedic concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, even if it’s healthy, are there any educational or recreational benefits? This is not at all about what y’all are thinking: kinky sexual fetishes. At least not for all of us earthers. Instead, it is a search for universal human happiness. Ask yourselves: Have you recently spent a shoeless afternoon in the park with your loved ones? Have you ever driven a stick shift barefoot? Ever cracked open a cold one with your toes? Alright, alright, maybe not all of that, Mrs. Grundy. But at the end of the day we can agree that the best thing about shoes is taking them off once you get home. I was told it’s almost like the getting-rid-of-your-bra sensation: Freedom, comfort and protection by and through your bare body.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no snow and little rain, there is no better place to bathe in the alleged acceptance of earthing.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not only about liberation, though. Earthing is about the awareness of human waste, cigarette butts and broken beer bottles on the street. At the same time, we are all equal (or equally gross) without shoes as opposed to the luxury, high prices and social pressure associated with them. In many cases, there might be a pinch of arrogance involved with feeling alternative and good about yourself because no one else does it. But just imagine a world where we’d all do it. Without any artificial feet protection, we would naturally care more about hygiene and pollution and less about looks or material beauty because our health would be dependent on a clean environment.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                                                                  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a study abroad student, my attitude towards dress, and particularly footwear, in I.V. is similar to performing at drunken Wednesday karaoke nights at Rockfire. There’s room for experimentation, openness and risk because in the end, no one cares. And this is not just due to favorable geographical conditions of beaches, fields and forests. It is because of UCSB’s liberal student body, the fact that there are surfboard racks in front of residence halls and people wearing flip-flops to class. With no snow and little rain, there is no better place to bathe in the alleged acceptance of earthing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earthing haters usually base their arguments around comfort, hygiene and looks. Granted, the library is a sacred space of learning and reflection for some of our fellow humans. But then, how is earthing different from unpacking your smelly Subway meatball marinara sub in the eighth floor quiet rooms? Once your interpretation of personal freedom infringes on someone else’s, asking politely for permission is in order, whether it’s fast food or your extremities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And seriously, how are bare feet really that different from bare hands? Are we having a glove debate too? I doubt it. This hints at the importance of social constructivism regarding the norms and shared societal expectations of “civilized” behaviour. This is not to demand all-out nudity but to provide some impetus to think about the boundaries we have created. Essentially, we give behaviour and style meaning through our everyday discourse and the persistence of unquestioned traditional taboos. Let’s just forget about the whole shoe madness for a second and take off our fussy socks, both physically and mentally.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens encourages students and staff to think beyond socially-constructed boundaries and choose nature over materialism.</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88168\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88168\" data-attachment-id=\"88168\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/argument-in-the-office-is-barefooting-an-acceptable-practice/shoes-nexus-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=650%2C366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"shoes-nexus-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88168\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?resize=650%2C366\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88168\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>No Such Thing as the Right to Bare Feet</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Kat Chen</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My opponent Mr. Ahrens has given not only his opinion but has also slipped in gentle words of insidious guidance towards this Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile practice. Simon hails from Göttingen, Germany by way of England. His year of exchange in the U.S. gives him, in his own words, “room for experimentation, openness and risk because in the end, no one cares.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I care, Simon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hobbesian ideals of human freedom locked so seamlessly into our revolutionary founding texts lure millions of hopeless romantics like Simon to see this country as a land of exploration. I am tired of white men frolicking through Isla Vista barefoot like the world is their backyard: it began with Columbus, with Lewis and Clark, with Neil Armstrong. The set of soil-crusted toenails perched next to my ear in Pollock Theater is new wave Manifest Destiny. But these “earthers” do not explore uncharted waters or unknown lands. They are not lunar heroes of the Cold War. They are only the disciples of a false gospel, victims to their own disgusting faith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much ink has been spilt lauding the joys of being barefoot. On a hot day in mid-July, I can imagine plunging my feet into the beachy banks of a quiet lake, my toes wiggling through the baked surface to reach the wet sand underneath. On an endless stretch of grass, I see myself prying off both shoes and socks, lying down and letting scratchy sprouts envelop me, head to toe. In the tenderness of my own home, I will sit, criss-cross applesauce, nothing between my soles and the green plush of my carpet. The simplicity of these pleasures must be the source of inspiration for earthing. My sympathies end there.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I am supportive of Simon’s angsty nihilism and general call to arms for anarchy, let us lead the revolution shoed.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon argues that I have caved to the “norms and shared societal expectations of ‘civilized’ behaviour.” He has basically called me, and all of us who wear shoes, sheeple. While I am supportive of Simon’s angsty nihilism and general call to arms for anarchy, let us lead the revolution shoed. There’s a reason we cyberbully flat-earthers, climate change deniers and anti-vaxxers: for the good of the herd and for the safety of future generations, we must uphold truths that serve to propel progress. Shoes protect us from tetanus, I.V.’s balmy 42-degree weather and street vomit from last Thursday. They act as a buffer between the outside world and the inside, marking clear boundaries between where public spaces end and personal ones begin. The eschewing (e</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shoe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ing? Ha!) of these thresholds is a privilege exploited by the barefoot of Isla Vista. Most of the responses to my post on our Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page seeking earthers were written by, you guessed it, white students. Remember: “No Shoes, No Service” does not apply equally to all who roam shoeless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earthing’s health claims, based on the alleged power of electrons from the ground to counteract the body’s free radicals (to treat anything from depression to cancer), cling to studies like</span> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one from 2012, co-authored by Stephen Sinatra, a co-author of “Earthing: The Most Important Health Discovery Ever!” by Clinton Ober, Sinatra and Martin Zucker. Despite the study’s complete ignorance of “correlation does not equal causation,” earthing is now a small empire, with a vast offering of official Earthing® products targeted towards its cult of believers. Yours for the hot deal of only $69.99, the Earthing Wearables Kit comes with, unbelievably, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">socks</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For your feet. To wear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The claim that earthing is “the most important health discovery ever” isn’t doing wonders for its reputation either. To prove their proclaimed faith to revert to a Paleolithic age, I invite earthers to renounce all modern medicine: the smallpox vaccine, the MRI, even their eyeglasses. If they can’t read the slides, maybe they’ll stop attending my lectures. Maybe then the calloused, punctured, reeking, selfish symbol of American liberty will finally stop encroaching on my minimal expectations of personal freedoms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, I would never get into your car if you insisted on driving stick shift barefoot.

While the amount and content of coursework is comparable, I came to appreciate my previous experiences in open debate and in-depth student presentations. At home, TAs were mainly in charge of sparking discussion through controversy based on readings rather than desperately trying to find a student to read aloud the assigned weekly paper and then spend the rest of section summarizing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my first year, students were essentially thrown in at the deep end, a phenomenon which is exemplified by the absence of prompts in essay assignments. While this may seem daunting, it effectively taught me how to structure and develop a thesis beyond set standards of what is considered right or wrong. Rather than myopically following instructions, this teaching style facilitated the formation of opinions and proved rewarding both academically, by improving argumentative originality, as well as personally, by inducing the feeling of having produced my own work.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83730\" style=\"width: 422px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83730\" data-attachment-id=\"83730\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-24/sheriffs-deputies-discover-human-remains-near-del-playa-beach/screen-shot-2018-07-25-at-9-20-42-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=2048%2C989&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,989\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-07-25 at 9.20.42 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=250%2C121&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=888%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-83730\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM-250x121.png?resize=412%2C199\" alt=\"\" width=\"412\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=250%2C121&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=768%2C371&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=1024%2C495&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83730\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my global studies courses here are filled with data, graphs and theoretical concepts which are, of course, essential to understanding the topic, yet often counterproductive in initiating debate. While students are on top of their game in factual knowledge given the frequency of homework, quizzes and midterms (which seem to arise at any point but in the middle of term), a critical approach to controversial issues is seldom asked for. Questions on the part of the students are not non-existent but largely directed toward the study guide for the next quiz and clarifications or definitions, which students then obediently type into their MacBooks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one of my classes, we are supposed to analyse highly ambivalent philosophical texts. Our first paper encouraged institutions to consider students as co-creators of education rather than mere recipients. Having read it, I could not wait for potentially controversial discussions in the gloomy halls of I.V. Theater. In contrast to the critical theory, however, the lecture was a pinpointed summary rather than an analysis, let alone a critique. Ironically, the main thesis — thinking for yourself — of this and subsequent readings seemed like a distant utopia, essentially desirable but expressed in too old a document to apply to our classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The corresponding sections nipped any serious debate in the bud by featuring enjoyable yet awkwardly long surveys about our personal lives and monotonous monologues by a TA who seemed to have turned the section into an emotional support group. This is not to downplay the importance of connecting with your peers, but it is quite telling regarding the apparent disinterest of some teaching staff in conveying critical analysis skills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessment through multiple choice quizzes effectively tests diligence but undervalues opinion and coherent argumentation, which could be practiced in presentations or group discussions. A clear imperative by professors to respond to exam questions in a way that “resembles the way we talked about them in class” restricts the possibility of an independent and personal analysis from the start. One gets the impression that students are primarily supposed to learn rather than think, let alone learn how to think critically.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From getting to know regular UCSB students during my first weeks in I.V., I experienced the wider social and personal implications to this particular structure of academic life. There appears to be a broad consensus on a clear separation between university and the social environment. “Do your work and then enjoy life” is a motto I have often heard around other Gauchos.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When connecting this experience to the wider social life, it struck me that the largely mechanical learning ideology has counterproductive effects on overall student interaction and may create a negative attitude towards pursuing an academic degree in the first place.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than seeing both academia and social life as something that can be unified through subject-related discussions with friends while chugging Natty Daddy’s at Sands, classwork appears to be more like a part-time job than a life-shaping endeavour. Of course, we all finish our essays in the last minute and go out to crash Friday parties on DP, but almost no one comes back to discussing the controversies of the essay topic once sobering up with friends and munching on</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jesus Burgers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not at all to demand nerdy discussions or to put an end to the marvelousness of casual trash talk for the sake of upkeeping academic rigour and obsession. It is to say that given a sincere interest in your degree subject, there should be a lot more to most class readings and assignments than the feeling of relief you get when scratching them off your to-do list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being critical of the lack of critical thinking also requires a critical approach to one’s own views. These observations are the source of a highly subjective eight-week experience of an I.V. newcomer. Naturally, this is also a highly restricted depiction of academic life given that the discussion or lack thereof regarding moral controversies are mostly found in the social sciences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my friends from home FaceTime me and ask about my study abroad experience, I excitedly tell them about I.V.’s welcoming culture, the inexhaustible supplies of the A.S. Food Bank and the electrifying feeling of liberation during sunset surfs. But I also tell them about the one-sided academic culture of memorization and how I miss controversial discussions and self-determined studying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My academic culture shock at UCSB has been not so much about the content of the classes but about the way they are taught. By following a high school doctrine of internalizing information instead of analysis-based teaching, the class structure hampers independent thinking and debate between and among students and staff. Consequently, students themselves demand to be taken by the hand and guided through the jungle of homework assignments instead of following their academic passions through specialisation and research. While debating with a friend about the outline of this opinion piece, we realised that the nature of teaching at UCSB has not yet allowed for one of the most exciting and valuable characteristics of university life: learning from your peers. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens encourages UCSB students and staff to foster independent thinking and meaningful discussions both inside and outside the classroom. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf63503ba78bd4c17a04ab3f91476f1?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf63503ba78bd4c17a04ab3f91476f1?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simon-ahrens/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simon Ahrens</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simon Ahrens is a second-year Global Studies study-abroad student.
