Her 13 kills in the third set alone led the Gauchos to a victory after coming back from an early 7-1 deficit, but even though she was a driving force in putting up a team total of 60 kills compared to Yale’s collective 56, her dominance was not quite enough to take the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB closed out the evening facing USC (7-2) for its second match of the day, but with four of the six Gaucho starters out due to injury, the Trojans made quick work of the home team with scores 15-25, 16-25, 20-25 to give the No. 19 team in the country a quick 3-0 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite USC putting up a .389 kill percentage while UCSB presented a measly .074, Santa Barbara’s defense enhanced notably by the third set of the match. The Gauchos strongly recorded five team blocks and forced the previously errorless Trojans from the first two sets to make nine attack errors. They even turned around and tied the third set at 17-all, but after a USC timeout, the visitors’ went on an 8-3 run to finish it.</p>\n<p>Despite not being able to have a chance to win their own tournament, Saturday’s match against Arkansas still meant a lot to a Gaucho team that was still in search of their first win of the season.</p>\n<p>The match was a tense five-set competition full of action. After some grappling on day one of the tournament, UCSB really played some of its best volleyball against the Razorbacks but was just shy of the win, losing the match 3-2 with set scores of 25-16, 20-25, 19-25, 25-21, 11-15.</p>\n<p>The first set was particularly outstanding for the Gauchos as they routed a deciding score of 25-16 thanks to a hot .480 kill percentage with five kills from Ruddins, who ended the match with 24 total, three aces, and four blocks while Arkansas served zero aces and put up zero blocks.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB then lost sets two and three 20-25 and 19-25 to give the Razorbacks the advantage going into the fourth set, but they battled back to stay alive and win the fourth 25-21.</p>\n<p>The fifth and final set to 15 points came to an 8-8 tie, but Arkansas’ back-to-back kills from Pilar Victoria and Elizabeth Pamphile gave them the momentum to go on a 5-2 run with three more kills from Victoria to decide the final set at 15-11.</p>\n<p>It was a heartbreaking loss for the women of Santa Barbara, but their solid performance throughout the match demonstrated a great deal of team cohesion and improvement. One could only hope that UCSB will be able to turn those positives into a win soon, especially before Big West play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be heading to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania this upcoming weekend to compete in another four-team tournament, the Pitt Panther Challenge, beginning Friday, Septemeber 15 and concluding Saturday, Septemeber 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78777\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78777\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-13/gauchos-remain-winless-after-three-tough-losses-in-annual-thunderdome-classic/","id":5493,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[5492,5491,5490],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Hawaii for Regular Season Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.05.21_StephenManga_Baseball-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.05.21_StephenManga_Baseball-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering its final regular season series, the UCSB baseball team seeks to salvage up some victories to conclude what has been an underwhelming campaign in its road trip to Hawaii.

Altogether, the Gauchos are batting .272.</p>\n<p>Leading the Rainbow Warriors’ .267 team batting average is junior outfielder Dylan Vchulek, who is hitting .309 with 60 hits on the year.

Smith then advanced to second on a wild pitch, Hornung’s second wild pitch of the inning, giving the Gauchos an extra base. With Smith on second and Burns on third, the all-mighty and powerful Austin Bush, who struck out swinging in his first at-bat, crushed a three-run jack for No. 19 of the year to surpass Tyler Von Schell (18 HRs, 2001).</p>\n<p>After Bush cleared them, senior outfielder Billy Fredrick got on with a walk, and junior utility Kenny Corey drilled an RBI triple to left field to add one more run before the end of the first half of the third and make it 5-0.</p>\n<p>Hawaii had an opportunity to retaliate and score in the bottom of the third with two outs when junior second baseman Johnny Weeks singled to right and Davis loaded the bases after handing over two consecutive walks, but Davis then got himself out of the inning by striking out final batter sophomore Kekai Rios to leave all three Rainbow Warriors stranded.</p>\n<p>Both sides left one guy on base through a scoreless fourth, and if Hornung thought Bush might have had enough for the day after achieving his record, he was sorely mistaken. One homer was certainly not enough for Bush, as he opened the top of the fifth with a solo shot to right center for home run No. 20 of the season before Hornung sent the following three Gauchos back to the dugout.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the fifth started with Rainbow Warriors redshirt junior Chayce Kaaua both reaching first and advancing to second on back-to-back throwing errors from UCSB junior shortstop JJ Muno. Kaaua then went to third on a single to right center from junior center fielder Dylan Vchulek, who rounded and made it to second on the throw, and RBI team leader freshman Dustin Demeter finally drove in some runs for Hawaii with a single to left, increasing his running RBI count from 27 to 29 and changing the score board from a 6-0 shutout to a 6-2 four-run deficit.</p>\n<p>However, this four-run deficit would increase to a five-run deficit with a score of 7-2 by the top of the eighth when the Gauchos added one final run on an RBI sac-bunt from Grover, while Hawaii’s bats were only able to produce those two runs for the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>Games two and three of this weekend’s series at Les Murakami Stadium will prove to be just as important as this one, with the 2017 season coming to a close and Santa Barbara and Hawaii now tied in BWC standings. Both squads will be looking to knock each other down while chasing UC Davis (9-13 BWC), who is just one game ahead in conference.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78197\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78197\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/","id":4116,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4115,4114,4113],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bush, Muno Help UCSB Ding USC 6-5","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Baseball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-17-17_10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Baseball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-17-17_10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Juniors Austin Bush and J.J.

Redshirt junior Kenny Corey singled to right and redshirt freshman Tommy Jew moved him over to third by ripping a double down the left field line. With no outs, redshirt junior JJ Muno roped a single to plate both Corey and Jew but was thrown out by Riverside left fielder AJ Sawyer when attempting to advance to second base.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders then immediately got their second and third outs from the two following Gauchos to end the top of the second and decided to answer back with three runs of their own in the bottom of the inning.</p>\n<p>UCR second baseman Cody Sporrer got up with two outs and smacked a three-run blast off of Nelson down the left field line. The junior took a trip around the bases and scored teammates sophomore Matt Hardy and freshman Connor Cannon for an even score of 3-3.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB monster hitter Austin Bush was not going to let the score remain tied for long. Junior second baseman Colton Burns placed himself on first with a single up the middle, and Bush, junior first baseman as well as the Gauchos slugging percentage leader, recorded his tenth homer of the season and put Santa Barbara backup 5-3 in the top of the third.</p>\n<p>To make the game even more interesting and competitive, Riverside’s bats did not stay quiet either in their offensive half of the inning as they brought in three runs off of three hits to lead UCSB 6-5.</p>\n<p>Nelson walked Shultz and advanced him to second on a pitch that hit Sawyer. After putting runners on first and second, Nelson then allowed three RBI singles from UCR third baseman Michael Farris, first baseman Cade Peters, and designated hitter Cannon. Nelson was subsequently pulled from the mound at this point and replaced by RHP Kevin Chandler (0-1, 4.95 ERA), who struck out the final two batters to end the third inning.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the fifth, the Highlanders put up one more with a sac-fly from Peters that brought in senior center fielder Mark Contreras to make it 7-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offense created only two hits and zero runs after their third inning at-bats, but they finally grew tired of their silence at the plate as they roared back with a late offensive surge to the top of the eighth. UCSB had four hits: a single to right from Bush, a single up the middle from sophomore DH Sam Cohen, a RBI single from Jew, and another RBI single from Muno. These scored two more for the ‘Chos to tie it again at 7-7.</p>\n<p>Ledesma, who replaced Chandler in the bottom of the seventh with two outs, fanned Cannon and Hardy and retired Sporrer with a fly-out to left in the bottom of the eighth to keep the score 7-7. He struggled a bit more in the bottom of ninth, giving up two walks but leaving those two Highlanders on base with two more strikeouts and another fly-out. In the tenth, he gave up two hits but still kept UCR from reaching home plate. And in the bottom of the eleventh, the allowance of a hit, two more walks, and a devastating error led to a walk-off win for the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>He struggled a bit more in the bottom of ninth, giving up two walks but leaving those two Highlanders on base with two more strikeouts and another fly-out.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara has won six of its last ten, but its last four wins have been a bit too close for comfort, with only a one to three run difference in the final score.</p>\n<p>But to their advantage, they trump Riverside in just about every offensive statistical category, leading UCR overall as a team in runs, hits, home runs, RBIs, walks, and stolen bases with a collective .277 batting average over the Highlanders .249 team average.</p>\n<p>Individually, UCSB junior Austin Bush is tied for first in Big West home runs at nine so far with CSUN junior Albee Weiss and is sitting at second, following Weiss, in conference RBIs with 32. Bush is one of the Gauchos biggest power hitters as the team leader in RBIs and home runs, along with sophomore Sam Cohen who is slugging .529 just above Bush’s .517 percentage.</p>\n<p>From Riverside, freshman Connor Cannon is behind Bush and Weiss in Big West homers with seven, putting the pitcher and first baseman for the Highlanders at second in a three-way tie with UC Irvine junior Keston Hiura and CSUN redshirt junior Kevin Riley. Other than Cannon, who also leads his team in RBIs, there is no one else from UCR is leading individually in conference hitting stats.</p>\n<p>Another Highlander for the Gauchos pitching staff and defense to tread lightly with at the dish is Mark Contreras, who is leading his team with a batting average of .402 and a mighty slugging percentage of .598.</p>\n<p>Regarding defense on the diamond, UC Riverside has been just slightly tighter and cleaner than UCSB this year with a .967 fielding percentage and eight fewer errors than the Gauchos line of defense, which has produced a .962 fielding percentage.</p>\n<p>On the mound, though, UCSB comes out on top with a combined 4.72 ERA to the Highlanders 5.50 ERA, also having allowed 25 less total earned runs, 39 fewer walks, and 14 more strikeouts than the UCR pitching staff.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams challenged each other was at the end of the 2016 season, in which the Highlanders grabbed the three-game series from the Gauchos with two wins at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p>Based on the subpar offensive and pitching statistics on behalf of UCR in comparison to those of UCSB, this could be an opportunity for the Gauchos to take advantage of their opponent’s larger weaknesses at the plate and on the hill to improve both their conference and overall records back to the .500 mark, or above, if they can execute two victories this weekend.</p>\n<p>However, as a disclaimer, previous statistical analysis cannot predict anything that will happen within nine innings of baseball.</p>\n<p>So although this is a team performing below average thus far, it does not mean that the Highlanders cannot defy expectations and start performing anomalous to their recent battles to keep it interesting.</p>\n<p>If there is anything a baseball player, coach, or fan can expect, it would be to not have any expectations. We can paint a pretty picture based on statistics and think about who should win, but it’s rarely the case that those statistics consistently and accurately translate what can happen, who could be the catalyst or the hero, or which team will end up taking the win.</p>\n<p>The series kicks off at 6 p.m. on Friday at Riverside Sports Complex, with another 6 p.m. evening game on Saturday, and an afternoon Sunday game at 1 p.m. to round out the series.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77453\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77453\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/","id":4129,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4128,4127,4126],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Game One Against SDSU 5-3","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-04-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Baseball_vsNevada-170411-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Baseball_vsNevada-170411-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos dropped game one of its three-game set against the Aztecs earlier today by a final tally of 5-3.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It was a beautiful day to play baseball at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium as the UCSB baseball team kicked off its three-game set against San Deigo State.</p>\n<p>Despite the allure of a beautiful day, UCSB gave away a lingering 3-3 game late in the top of the ninth for a tough 5-3 loss to the Aztecs.

The Gauchos were hitting the ball hard at some points, but their offense struggled as they failed to direct those hard hit balls between the gaps and continued to leave their men stranded on base by the end of the inning on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>Despite allowing one run early in the second, UCSB starting RHP Noah Davis (6-3, 4.57 ERA) was dominant across seven and one-third frames, recording five of his six strikeouts in the second and third innings alone.</p>\n<p>But in the fifth, Davis gave up two consecutive RBI singles from sophomore first baseman Jordan Verdon and junior left fielder Tyler Adkison to score second baseman junior Alan Trejo and third baseman senior Andrew Brown, making the score 3-0 SDSU.</p>\n<p>In reference to the previous statement about SDSU having a scary talented offense that may or may not haunt the dreams of the pitchers who prepare to face them, the batting averages of these four Aztecs, in the order mentioned previously, are .329, .393, .329, and .322 on the season so far.</p>\n<p>UCSB, on the other hand, was graciously given opportunities to score on errors, just after SDSU had them scoreless with a three-run deficit thanks to their bats.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior catcher Dempsey Grover put down a solid bunt toward third base in the bottom of the fifth, which caused SDSU pitcher Marcus Reyes to scramble in a hurry to get the ball to first for an overthrow that advanced Grover to second. An additional panicked overthrow following Reyes’ from Aztecs junior right fielder Chase Calabuig then advanced the Gauchos redshirt junior all the way home to finally put UCSB on the board.</p>\n<p>Davis then retired SDSU over four at-bats in the top of the sixth, and the Gauchos plated two more runs in the bottom of that inning to even the playing field once again at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The second Gaucho scored was Billy Fredrick, who was knocked in on a RBI single from center fielder Tommy Jew. But Fredrick himself got on base due to a fielding error from Trejo, so his run was deemed unearned.</p>\n<p>Then, because baseball has its way with being weird, Jew left to steal second in a runners-on-first-and-third scenario with two outs in the bottom of the sixth, and when SDSU catcher Dean Nevarez stood up in his attempt to throw Jew out at second, he hit his own pitcher, Reyes, square in the right cheek of his buttocks (some may argue left cheek to trigger debate) instead. This humorous error deflected the ball toward right field, easily allowing sophomore DH Sam Cohen, who was standing on third, to make his way home.</p>\n<p>From here, the score remained tied up at 3-3 until the top of the ninth, in which Trejo took a leadoff strikeout much to his disappointment, causing him to be ejected by the home plate umpire.</p>\n<p>Although this could have critically affected SDSU in a crucial tiebreaker situation, Trejo’s ejection did not deter them from putting up two more before the Gauchos final word.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs were able to take back the lead with a RBI single up the middle off of UCSB RHP Kevin Chandler (0-1, 5.74 ERA) from Verdon to score Brown, and a sac-fly from Calabuig off of Chandler’s replacement, LHP Steven Ledesma (1-3, 7.99 ERA), to score senior shortstop Danny Sheehan.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior JJ Muno, who is now the teams’ shortstop after the injury to key player Clay Fisher, began the bottom of the ninth with a single to right field to hopefully spark a UCSB comeback. Unfortunately, though, he stood there for the duration of three consecutive fly-outs from Grover, Colton Burns, and Billy Fredrick to officially end the game 5-3, crushing any hopes of heading into tie-breaking extras.</p>\n<p>It was a tough game for the ‘Chos as for the first time in their last eight games, they were held under six runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offense should take the evening to recuperate because they will be back tomorrow facing off against the Aztec’s authoritative lefty Dominic Purpura who is a perfect 6-0 on the year with a 2.85 ERA.</p>\n<p>This kind of intimidation might positively motivate UCSB to improve its mindset at the plate and smack some runs in early in the likely case that the Aztecs have an offensive explosion. In the case of SDSU, some early fielding practice might go a long way for them in this series.</p>\n<p>Game two between the Gauchos and the Aztecs takes place at 2 p.m. tomorrow at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

The junior would continue to have a great day as he finished 3 for 4 with one RBI.</p>\n<p>Riley then made it home when junior DH Albee Weiss sent a double to left, and Weiss followed right behind him on a single from junior third baseman Nolan Bumstead for a total of four runs by the bottom of the third for CSUN.</p>\n<p>With the score reading 4-0 Matadors, the Gauchos quickly responded by creating two runs in the top of the fourth on two sacrifice flies from freshman right-fielder Armani Smith and junior first baseman Austin Bush, bringing in junior second baseman Colton Burns and senior left fielder Billy Fredrick, respectively.</p>\n<p>Despite scoring two runs, Santa Barbara missed on an opportunity, that would not come for the remainder of the game, to take complete control of the contest as it had runners on the corners with no outs before the sac flies mustered the two runs.</p>\n<p>Davis retired Northridge in the bottom of the fourth to hold the score 4-2, but his arm would not hold up for long as CSUN extended its lead to make a close two-run game turn into a five-run deficit for UCSB by the start of the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>Those three runs were accumulated in conjunction with a double from Riley and a two-run HR from Weiss. These two sluggers and fellow teammates are tied for first in Big West conference HRs and are first and second place in the RBI leaders with the former in second place and the latter in first.</p>\n<p>The offense from both dugouts quieted down considerably in the sixth inning all the way through the eighth, with only one single coming from each side.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos last attempts to tie the game or get ahead, they managed to put one more run on the board in the top of the ninth for a final score of 7-3.</p>\n<p>Although things seem to be looking in favor of Northridge at this point, the Gauchos can still turn this series around and take it with victories on Saturday and Sunday that could, hopefully for their sake, generate a win-streak moving forward.</p>\n<p>The 2017 season is swiftly accelerating closer to Regionals with each and every game, so if UCSB wants another appearance in the NCAA tournament come June, they are going to need to start competing much more exceptionally than they have been, preferably to their fans as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its three-game conference set against CSUN in game two starting tomorrow at 1 p.m. at Matador Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As for pitching, the UCSB pitching staff has a total 4.76 ERA compared to a 4.89 ERA for that of CSUN.</p>\n<p>These team statistics are of little dominance in the Big West Conference overall, and they are not of great contrast in comparison to one another. However, they highlight that the Gauchos have marginally been pitching, producing fewer errors and creating hits a bit more successfully as a team than the Matadors have and that they generally have not been struggling as much as Northridge has.</p>\n<p>Despite the teams’ struggles, CSUN junior catcher and designated hitter Albee Weiss is leading the Big West in RBIs this season with 25 and teammate Kevin Riley is right behind him with 24.</p>\n<p>Riley, a redshirt junior first-baseman, is also tied for first in Big West in HRs with six total, just above Weiss, who is sitting at a tied second place with five HRs on the year so far. The two sluggers are placed at spots three and four, respectively, on the Matadors’ starting lineup and present a clear threat to the UCSB pitching staff and defense.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, junior outfielder Colton Burns is on the season leaderboard of hitting statistics, with a batting average of .362 to earn him the third spot in the Big West. But other than Burns, no other Gauchos are individually leading the conference at the plate. In fact, no other Gaucho hitter that has started every game is currently hitting above the .300 mark.</p>\n<p>As teams, neither UCSB nor CSUN evidently has a command over the other, making this series a fairly even matchup. However, they each have strong and talented individuals who assuredly have the potential to execute on any opportunities that come their way to produce a spark for success. Moreover, baseball is a game that has the tendency to defy any sort of expected outcomes one might provide, as most fans know.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, in particular, it definitely needs a change of pace if it wants to salvage what has been a rough start to the season. Advantageous to the Matadors, the Gauchos have a shaky 2-9 record when away from home, so they will certainly need to determine a way to gain more of an edge without their optimal home-field support.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on CSUN in a three-game series beginning at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 7th at Matador field with Saturday and Sunday’s games kicking off at 1 p.m. at the same location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

The Cougars had been on the road for a tough 10 consecutive games and were eagerly eyeing a win in their home opener against the Gauchos.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB got on the board first on Thursday with two runs in the top of the second and another in the third, but BYU answered in their second inning at-bats with one run, continuously producing a run per inning until they led 4-3 by the bottom of the fifth.</p>\n<p>In the top half of the sixth, the Gauchos racked up three more runs to make it 6-4 and take the lead back from the Cougars. After sophomore designated hitter Sam Cohen touched home on junior third baseman Kenny Corey’s single to tie the game 4-4, BYU junior starting pitcher Maverik Buffo (1-3, 5.06 ERA) was relieved by junior lefty Rhett Parkinson (0-0, 4.50 ERA).</p>\n<p>However, this pitching change did not do much to adversely affect the Gauchos as they continued to get on base, scoring freshman center fielder Tommy Jew on a throwing error by BYU senior catcher Bronson Larsen and knocking in Corey on a sac-fly to the right from UCSB junior shortstop Clay Fisher.</p>\n<p>The Cougars bats did not stay quiet with a late surge in the seventh to make it a close one-run game once again. However, they were not able to retrieve the lead from the Gauchos, who remained hot at the plate, for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>The first game of Friday’s doubleheader started out optimistically for the Gauchos, who broke it wide open by putting up five runs in the top of the first. Their defense then retired the side in order in the bottom half for a successful first inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB junior starting pitcher Kyle Nelson (1-2, 5.30 ERA) gave up a two-run jack to BYU’s Larsen in the bottom of the second, and the scoreboard read 5-2 through a scoreless third and fourth innings.</p>\n<p>Nelson was pulled with one out in the bottom of the fifth after giving up another home run, a line drive doubles, and three singles that culminated into three runs for the Cougars to make it 5-5. Freshman RHP Shea Barry (0-1, 3.52 ERA) gave up one more single, allowing BYU to score another run and make it 6-5 Cougars before he retired the final two batters.</p>\n<p>UCSB urgently got a run back to tie it 6-6 in the top of the sixth. Redshirt junior catcher Dempsey Grover struck out swinging but reached first on an error from BYU freshman catcher David Clawson and scored on a triple from Fisher.</p>\n<p>Barry had a controlled one-two-three inning in the bottom half of the sixth to hold the score, but the Cougars defense had a three-up, three-down inning as well in the top of the seventh to keep the Gauchos in check. Then, in walk-off fashion, Cougars sophomore shortstop Daniel Schneemann homered to right field, tragically defeating UCSB 7-6 for BYU’s first win of the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had opportunities to capitalize throughout the game considering they left six runners on base, but their opportunities to score were cut short with the game only set to last seven innings.</p>\n<p>Matters worsened from there as UCSB carried Friday afternoon’s loss into the second game, losing in a 17-3 blowout that night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had three fielding errors, junior RHP Chris Clements (0-3, 9.42 ERA) allowed 13 runs in three innings, and freshman LHP Ben Brecht (0-0, 4.35 ERA) allowed six more in the fourth alone after relieving Clements before he finally halted BYU’s offense from getting on the board for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>The only three runs scored by UCSB were a home run from Fisher in the first and two unearned runs in the eighth on an error from BYU sophomore right fielder Brock Hale.</p>\n<p>The noon finale on Saturday was another high scoring game at 14-8 to the Gauchos demise, but not as merciless as Friday’s 17-3 nightcap.</p>\n<p>Saturday mirrored the first game of Friday’s doubleheader in that UCSB came out strong in the first inning, earning four, but their defense continued to give up more runs than their bats could generate and they suffered from three more fielding errors. Gauchos junior starting pitcher Steven Ledesma (0-2, 9.20 ERA) took the loss, giving up 10 runs over four and one-third innings.</p>\n<p>In a more positive light, UCSB continues to lead the BYU series now at 8-4, and despite Friday night’s defeat, the Gauchos offense seems to be alive and active. Certainly, their defense and pitching staff, in particular, have much to improve upon if they intend to win games and get back over .500.</p>\n<p>However, it is still early in the season with a plenty of baseballs left to play, meaning there is sufficient time to recover and develop as a team.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be back at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for 11 successive games starting with this weekend’s series against Stony Brook University. The Gauchos return to their home turf should give them the confident advantage they need to make progress toward a winning season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Various signs, foam fingers, baseball hats, t-shirts, and chants were formed around this even-year idea along with the widely popular “Don’t Stop BeliEVEN” slogan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giants fans had to have known that it could only last so long when taking into account that there was no logical reasoning for how this “magic” was happening and why, but the phrases were catchy, the environment at AT&amp;T Park was unsurpassable and the belief of it all brought a great deal of optimism and playful banter among Giants fans and their rivals.</span></p>\n<p>2016 seemed like another ambitious year for the Giants to achieve the status of World Series champions, especially after making it through an embarrassing second half of the season.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A dominant Madison Bumgarner at the mound made a return to the postseason after his historic 2014 run, and Conor Gillaspie, an unlikely postseason hero blasting a three-run jack in the 9th, powered the Giants past the New York Mets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mets were favored to take the wild card and advance to the NLDS, considering their ace Noah Syndergaard is some sort of mutant science experiment, given his hammer for an arm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Bumgarner was looking to master his craft once again as one of the greatest postseason pitchers, and the Giants overcame Syndergaard and his hammer, allowing the fans to continue believing in the streak. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After coming off a high from their wild card win, the Giants were confident and ready to face the Chicago Cubs, although they knew it would be a challenging feat. San Francisco had a long postseason ahead of them, while the Cubs had been crushing it all season long. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicago led 2-0 in a five-game NLDS series when it came time for San Francisco to finally host Game 3. At this point, there was some uncertainty for the Giants, but they rallied when Gillaspie came through once again with a go-ahead triple off of Chapman in the 8th and Brandon Crawford added some cushion to create a 5-3 lead for the Giants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They lost their lead in the 9th when Kris Bryant tied the game 5-5, due to Sergio Romo’s unfortunate ability to give up runs. But, yet again, the Giants vociferously fought back in the bottom of the 13th, many thanks to Joe Panik’s double to drive in Crawford and make it 6-5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giants fans were elated at the victory and the Cubs intimidating determination to end their 108-year World Series championship drought became less threatening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as obvious as it was throughout the second half of their 2016 season and postseason, San Francisco’s bullpen was not deep enough to carry them past the Cubs and on to another World Series championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The devastation of saying goodbye to the even-year voodoo was painful. The “BeliEVEN” cheers had died by the end of a disastrous Game 4, in which Matt Moore pitched beautifully until the Giants closers threw their 5-2 lead away by giving up four runs to the Cubs in the 9th.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some argue that manager Bruce Bochy should have never taken Moore out of the game, even though he was nearing a considerably high pitch count. But ultimately, it was a lack of skill in the Giants closers that cost the franchise and its fans another even-year celebration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As heartbreaking as the 2016 postseason was for the Giants and their fans, that even-year magic was sweet while it lasted. By defying the odds, it gave Giants fans something unbelievable to believe in. But of course, there is some hype to get an odd-year streak going, so maybe the magic is not quite dead yet after all.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76237\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76237\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/","id":1903,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[1902,1901,1900],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/317"}},"__N_SSG":true}
