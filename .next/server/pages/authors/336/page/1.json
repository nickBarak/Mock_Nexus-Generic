That does seem to be the goal doesn’t it — getting some sexy thing into your bed naked? But then what do we do: lights out for the duration of the evening and an early-morning quick change?</p>\n<p>If imagining someone in the flesh gets us so immediately turned on, why do we so often spend the night reading body Braille? When did we go from “look, but don’t touch” to “see no evil?”</p>\n<p>The acceptance and appreciation of the naked human body is not only personal, but extremely culture specific. When I go to the beach here in Barcelona, I never wear a bathing suit top — not because I’m an exhibitionist, but because the majority of the women around me are doing the same. I mean, I can’t speak for guys, who think boobs are like fun bags filled with candy and treasure that can be stared at for hours on end, but becoming comfortable with exposing my breasts in public has really desensitized me when I spot them around town. I’ve actually gotten so used to seeing double that I don’t even bat an eye when a set of jugs crosses my path.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This of course begs the question: Are Americans too uptight about nudity? Well, that’s hard to say. No, we don’t see tits flashing up onscreen during a body soap commercial like so many European countries allow, but more and more ass-shots are sneaking into the PG-13 category and we’ve seemed to loosen up a bit about correlating female promiscuity to the amount of skin a girl’s outfit exposes.</p>\n<p>I suppose our main issue with nudity then, is with context. A woman taking out her breast in a public area to breastfeed her child is considered socially acceptable, but an innocent boob looking for a breeze to cool down in falls into the flasher category. Kids can run around naked up to a certain age, but are later told to be embarrassed about exposing themselves. This leaves the pre-teen years as a time of acne, awkward rubbing and self-consciousness, ultimately climaxing in loads of body image issues. We are told to cover up, then to make our bodies look flawless and rock-hard when we are naked, and finally called sluts and show-offs for letting it all hang out. Ok, so maybe Americans aren’t uptight, but we certainly are confused.</p>\n<p>I know what you’re thinking, that’s fine and dandy, but what does this have to do with Pootie Tang? Well, since the only reason I am here is to give you a boner in class let me assure you that there is a point to all this and it definitely has to do with your sex life.</p>\n<p>On average, how many people throughout the day see you completely, head-to-toe, buck naked? I’m talking full-frontal flesh couture. The fact is, we want our bodies to look great, but who’s really seeing them in the nude? Well, yeah, our private-part doctors, but mostly the people we choose to have sex with. These are the individuals we allegedly trust enough to expose ourselves to completely — mind and body.</p>\n<p>Yet I’ll be the first to admit that feeling comfortable sleeping with someone and feeling comfortable being naked in front of the same person are two entirely separate issues. Yes, they should come hand-in-hand, but when it comes down to self-esteem and openness, there is a huge disconnect between our sexuality and how comfortable we are with our naked selves.</p>\n<p>So many women have a really hard time opening up to having sex with the light on or during the day, just because they’re afraid the person they’re sleeping with won’t like what they see. Well let me just say that if someone is in your bed, they are attracted to your body and want to see all you have to offer. If you can just let yourself be vulnerable and let go, the sex you’re having will be even sexier.</p>\n<p>So let’s stop playing hide-and-seek, drop trou and step into the limelight. Sex should tantalize all the senses, and seeing is believing. Plus, no one in their right mind would say no to a morning-after shower sesh. Naked, wet, delicious.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38285\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-11/love-light-ignites-passion-illuminates-sexuality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38285\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-11/love-light-ignites-passion-illuminates-sexuality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-11/love-light-ignites-passion-illuminates-sexuality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-11/love-light-ignites-passion-illuminates-sexuality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-11/love-light-ignites-passion-illuminates-sexuality/","id":6455,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6454,6453,6452],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Sex Columnist Thinks Missionary is For Squares","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Just out of curiosity: When was the last time your fuck of the night bit your ear, whispered, “How do you want it?” and you responded, “Baby, give it to me in missionary.

He<br>\nmight as well be fucking a corpse — which, nasty<br>\nas it is — is actually a thing. So make like an upsidedown,<br>\nsuper-malleable pepper grinder and work<br>\nhim back.</p>\n<p>Another easy hop, skip and a fuck away from missionary<br>\ninvolves grabbing her legs and moving them around until<br>\nsomething feels O-tastic. Go ahead, continental soldier, throw<br>\n‘em over your shoulder. Just maybe avoid tyin’ ‘em in a knot and/<br>\nor bow while testing out her flexibility.</p>\n<p>Ok, now for the fun stuff. There are hundreds of crazyass<br>\nsex positions out there so I’ve narrowed it down to a few<br>\n(realistic) personal favorites that branch off of the go-to moves<br>\nyou already have in your itinerary. I really think most people<br>\nstick to the basics because they’re intimidated by crazy shit like<br>\nheadstands and busting your nut from across the room while<br>\nyour girlfriend’s humping some phallic vegetable with a sock in<br>\nher mouth.</p>\n<p>Now, we all know and love reverse cowgirl. It’s not too crazy<br>\nbut wild enough to make it feel dangerous. Alright hold that<br>\nthought. The guy should slide to the edge of the bed and put<br>\nhis feet on the floor while still lying down; then girls, sit on his<br>\nmember in the same position as we just discussed (backwards),<br>\nbut this time standing, using the floor for leverage. Then switch<br>\n— guy sits up and girl puts her hands on the floor. I like to call<br>\nthis the “Shit I lost my contact, oh wait that feels great.”</p>\n<p>Moving forward, or should I say continuing backwards, is a<br>\nvariation on your favorite backdoor move. Instead of humping<br>\nher in the style of a dog, push her down flat on her<br>\nstomach with her legs straight and together. She’ll<br>\nbe super tight and you’ll feel super satisfied. And<br>\nif you’re in a frisky mood try it standing up — she<br>\nfaces the wall, he creeps up from behind. Mee-ow.<br>\nLet’s dub this one the, “I think I’m choking, oh<br>\nno let me perform the Heimlich, oh wait, now I’m<br>\nfucking you.”</p>\n<p>Consider this a preliminary syllabus — there<br>\nare obviously countless more ways to put your<br>\nimagination and lube to good use. Don’t be<br>\nembarrassed to try something new. Remember<br>\nclass, coming shouldn’t be the only reason you’re<br>\nhaving sex. You know what they say: getting there<br>\nis half the fun and a journey of a thousand orgasms<br>\nbegins with one experimental step.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/nexus-sex-columnist-thinks-missionary-squares/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/nexus-sex-columnist-thinks-missionary-squares/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/nexus-sex-columnist-thinks-missionary-squares/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/nexus-sex-columnist-thinks-missionary-squares/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/nexus-sex-columnist-thinks-missionary-squares/","id":6454,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6453,6452,6451],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stereotypes of Sexual Abstinence Harm Healthy Sexuality","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"My name is SF and I am celibate.

But it definitely hasn’t been amazing with some of the people I have been with, and I’m starting to realize that I have no interest in reliving past mistakes. In order to have no regrets, one must wash, rinse and never repeat.<br>\nPopular, hypersexualized culture would have me believe that this humping hiatus I’m experiencing is a “dry spell” — as if I have become some kind of barren landscape victim to Mother Nature’s withholding of fertilization. When we choose to abstain until marriage, we are labeled virgins-in-waiting, but when we choose to abstain from sex post-cherry pop, we are cursed as victims of a drought. So I’m supposed to feel ashamed when I’m having “too much” sex and even more embarrassed when I’m not having any?<br>\nAs much as I hate giving in to gender stereotypes, this situation is so different for women than it is for men. I’m not saying that men are slaves to their animal urges and have no coital filter. What I am suggesting is that women are usually presented with more situations where saying no and fighting off sex with someone they aren’t down to sleep with is necessary.<br>\nAt risk of sounding like a bitter old maid, how the hell do guys expect intercourse to be the end result of these horrible, offensive “moves” they’re putting on? Mind you, I live in Europe, which means the men I deal with on a day-to-night basis are instantly creepier. Last weekend I literally had a guy applaud, whistle and say “bravo” to me in passing. If you are wearing skin-tight women’s pants and enough gel in your hair to lubricate Andre the Giant’s penis, you are not allowed to up the ante on your sliminess by being a douchebag.<br>\nOK, so I.V. boys don’t necessarily spank your ass in place of shaking your hand like Euro-men do. I’ll give you that. But enough of the cause and back to the not-so-erect effect.<br>\nFor whatever reason, many people choose not to fornicate, and these people are called prudes. I hooked up with a guy my friend introduced me to last week, chose not to have sex with him and was called a prude for that decision. Me? A prude? This is crazy!<br>\nSo I’m either a slut or a prude. Are these my only choices? I feel like Goldilocks. I can be too hot and too cold, but how much sex is just right for a woman to have?<br>\nThis is not a ‘dry spell’ or a ‘slow season.’ I could go home with some loser tonight and get laid. The point is that right now, I’m actually enjoying not having meaningless, respectless sex. And when I decide that no-strings-attached arrangements are what I want again, I’ll do that. Just stop labeling me, because I’m never going to find the perfect sexual formula.<br>\nOne of my best friends is a virgin, and she is one of the hottest, sexiest chicks I know. She’s not waiting for marriage or Prince Charming. She’s going to have sex when it happens and feels right, and I think that is absolutely wonderful. And even though she’s never been penetrated, she is an extremely sexual person. The number of dicks you’ve hosted for the night has nothing to do with how in tune you are with your sexual self.<br>\nThere may be some prudes who exist out there, but I sure as hell have never met one. Sexuality is so much more than whether your daiquiri is virgin or not. I know some olive oil bottles that have got it going on but are denounced because of their ‘extra virgin’ labels.<br>\nSo until someone decides what amount of sex is the perfect amount, and until someone treats me like a human being rather than a set of fleshy holes, I’ll be standing by and waiting. And yes, I’m as horny as a housecat in heat; but in retrospect, sometimes it feels really good to wake up alone.</p>\n<p><em></em><em><br>\n</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36656\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36656\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/","id":6444,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6443,6442,6441],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Disciplined Religious Chastity Captivates the Promiscuous","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The life of an exchange student is a constant influx of new experiences, knowledge, food, ideas and people — basically whatever you can put into your mouth, grab by the hand or both.

So naturally, I meet characters each day who challenge, contradict and shock my beliefs to the core. Nothing, however, could have prepared me for what a new class project partner said to me this week. He told me that not only is he a virgin (in his late 20s), he has never been brought, by his own hand or another’s, to the point of ejaculation. In short, homeboy has lived an orgasm-free life, by choice.

Although I have chosen this particular spiritual path, I am of course aware that credence in religion is the foundation of many people’s lives. Likewise, sexuality, either the performance or restraint thereof, is as important in personality determination. The choice this young man has made about his sexuality is a determining factor of who he is, and this is all rooted in his faith.</p>\n<p>If religion plays a major role in one’s sexuality, and sexuality is a key component to one’s lifestyle, where does that leave the body’s desire to seek pleasure in the eyes of religion? Sex, kissing, touching or at the very least flirtation is how we mingle. It’s our way to break the ice and test compatibility. Could my perfect sexual match pass me by because he’s waiting and I’m not pure enough? How can we ever find someone to marry and have all this ‘sinless’ sex with if we are taught to be ashamed of that desire in the first place? Could faith and the learned avoidance of earthly pleasures be keeping us from finding love?</p>\n<p>In the book of Genesis, before Adam’s rib-baby gives into temptation and fucks up any chance we future generations may have had at sexuality free of remorse or disdain, a fascinating sentiment felt by both Eve and her male counterpart is highlighted. To quote the Old Testament following the creation of Eve, “And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed” (Genesis 1.2-25). It is not until paradise is lost that any shame is felt between the two unclothed individuals. Thus, there is a moment when bodily sexuality and spiritual sensuality are completely at one, and neither is something to be embarrassed about.</p>\n<p>I admire the steadfast devotion many of my friends have for their faiths, so I truly mean no disrespect when I say that if I were religious, I would like to believe in a higher power that would want me to be proud of the body I have been given and not feel ashamed about the way I consent to use it. I do not choose to see my sexuality as inherently evil. Perhaps this is why I could not imagine subjecting myself to the life of self-restraint my colleague and so many others have chosen.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I am utterly captivated by such discipline. The fact that someone can feel so strongly about what he/she believes as to completely cut out a part of human nature is pretty incredible. So I’m thinking it’s time for secular and devout communities to come to a major compromise, because if there’s one thing I do believe, it’s that a religious debate between believer and nonbeliever cannot be won.</p>\n<p>When it comes to sexuality and religion, it’s as simple as this: withhold judgment. My promiscuity should be of as much concern to you as your repression is to me — none at all. The majority of the population isn’t making sexual decisions to personally offend another party. Just be who you are and let everyone else do the same.<br>\nAnd if there is a God, I can tell you that he’s getting a whole lot of ironic attention from my orgasms. Now, do climax screaming fits count as prayer?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35401\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35401\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/","id":6443,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6442,6441,6440],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sex Columnist Kisses a Girl and Likes It: The Beauty of Exploration","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Doctor, here are my symptoms: I am confused, I’m questioning my identity and ability to reason and my genitals are swelling up like an ocean wave at the sight of a hot chick.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Doctor, here are my symptoms: I am confused, I’m questioning my identity and ability to reason and my genitals are swelling up like an ocean wave at the sight of a hot chick.

Why does it feel so natural to redirect my flirtation toward a woman at the slightest hint of curiosity? Maybe it’s because I write this column and want to prove to myself that I am as progressive and experimental as I urge all of you to be. Or perhaps, and this seems clearer to me every time I broach the subject, assigning a title to my sexuality no longer makes sense. If I am heterosexual and yet lust after women, even bisexuality doesn’t feel like the right fit. Now where’s the receipt for that Robert Pattinson blow-up love doll?</p>\n<p>I used to think bisexuality was like a gateway drug. Surely swinging both ways could only be a temporary distraction on the way to the gay train. But this assumption also discriminated by gender. Swapping a beer-soaked kiss with my best friend to rev up some guy’s engine didn’t make me lesbian, but a guy who dabbles in dick was clear as gay. Though a man’s hairy asshole doesn’t seem like something I would think a straight-shooter would crave on the weekends after a few sake bombs too many, who am I to say that scoping out the playing field isn’t part of the heterosexual experience? Why are we constantly being told to come out of closets we were never trapped in?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For those of you who have never been acquainted, I’d like to introduce you to Dr. Alfred Kinsey, a scientist who studied human sexuality in the 1940s and ‘50s. One of his most well-known contributions is the Kinsey scale, which rates sexual orientation from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual). What Kinsey suggested — which I firmly believe to be true — is that sexuality is not as black and white as the survey categories we’re used to squeezing ourselves into. I may be heterosexual with a rare tendency toward incidental homosexuality, or a homosexual who is almost equally attracted to partners of the opposite sex.</p>\n<p>Ok, I’m boring myself just writing this. The point I’m trying to get across is that I would classify myself as a two and I think you should consider opening your mind to a new way of viewing your own sexuality. Maybe your straight road has a few more windy kinks in it than you thought.</p>\n<p>Now that we’ve stripped our brains bare of limitations and conventions, maybe it’s time to remind all you swingers out there that with the rejection of borders comes the possible negligence of necessary boundaries. Just because you’re breaking free of your prescribed sexual identity doesn’t mean you can forget that when it comes to relationships, infidelity is infidelity, no matter what brand of genitalia your flavor of the week may possess. Unless your partner is involved, which is probably his fucking dream come true, a taste of twat is as potent as the scent of another man’s cologne on your dress.</p>\n<p>So if you feel imprisoned by your supposed sexual identity and want to explore, ease into it. I’m sure vagina is an acquired taste, just like a fine wine or a conservative’s sense of humor. Just stay true to yourself and spit out anything you don’t like. You can’t dislike something you’ve never tried.</p>\n<p>Bottom line is, saying I’m straight somehow implies that any experimentation I indulge in is crooked. If I don’t feel heterosexual, homosexual or even bisexual (since my tendencies toward each sex are hardly equal), maybe I’ll just settle with being, well, ambidextrous.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34970\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34970\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-30/sex-columnist-kisses-girl-likes-beauty-exploration/","id":6442,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6441,6440,6439],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cheaters Never Prosper, Especially in the Bedroom","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In school we are taught that cheating is an extremely severe offense punishable with failure and in some cases expulsion, but how many of you sneaky bastards have gotten away with a little dishonesty ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In school we are taught that cheating is an extremely severe offense punishable with failure and in some cases expulsion, but how many of you sneaky bastards have gotten away with a little dishonesty from time to time? The fact is, students pull fast ones on their teachers all the time, only to yield a passing grade and no consequence. If we allow our morals to relax in one area of our lives, where do we draw the line elsewhere if we do indeed get away with it? Calling all monogamists: today’s class discussion is “Degrees of Cheating.”</p>\n<p>So they didn’t sleep together, but he tells her intimate details he won’t disclose to you. They’ve never kissed, but have been exchanging “sexts” for the past week. She lied to you about letting her ex buy her a drink at a club. Are you in the wrong for feeling angry and betrayed?</p>\n<p>The fact is, jealousy is seriously dangerous territory. It can be healthy in small doses, but poisonous in excess. If your partner’s jealousy is smothering you and removing all stability and trust from the relationship, then it’s time to call it quits. However, the topic of discussion at hand may in some cases justify suspicion and jealousy to a certain degree.

Technological advancements have made casual cheating a part-time hobby. No longer must we stage a secret rendezvous at an out-of-town motel wearing oversized sunglasses and a cheap wig to get our juices flowing with another; we just have to boot up and log on. In this gray area of Facebook invites and picture texts, what does getting caught red-handed even entail?</p>\n<p>I think it’s fair to say that cheating begins with lying — if you feel like you need to lie about your actions or feelings, then you are engaging in deceit. A relationship should be open and honest, period. You should feel like you can have friends of the opposite sex and be trusted by your lover around them. If you’ve compromised that trust, you’re probably cheating.</p>\n<p>Alright, so maybe you do love your boyfriend or girlfriend, but get wasted one night only to wake up the next morning in an unfamiliar bed spooning an unexpected naked body. What should you do about a one-time slipup? Do you blab to get it off your chest or keep your mouth shut to avoid the backlash? I think it’s important that you first ask yourself why you got into this situation. Are you dissatisfied with your relationship, out of love or lacking the attention you need? If so, then you might consider the indiscretion as a wake-up call. If, however, you really do feel like it was a one-time mistake, it is better to zip it and bear the burden yourself than to break the heart of the person you love over something emotionally meaningless to you. Feeling guilty is your punishment, so suck it up.</p>\n<p>And what about a reversed situation? If your beau strays, do you forgive and move forward together or send him/her packing for good? Well, I’m from the school of thought that says sex is something corporeal and instinctive that often doesn’t come with emotional attachment. In other words, not all cheaters are made equal. If your partner had a lusty accident with some fox on the dance floor, that is entirely different than feeling emotionally attached to another person. Sex can be forgiven, love cannot.</p>\n<p>But, if you are very sensitive in this department and believe any form of cheating is betrayal, you may not feel comfortable staying with someone you don’t trust. Just listen to your gut. Time does heal wounds, but a broken heart is a tough cut to mend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34327\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/cheaters-prosper-bedroom/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34327\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/cheaters-prosper-bedroom/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/cheaters-prosper-bedroom/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/cheaters-prosper-bedroom/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/cheaters-prosper-bedroom/","id":6440,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6439,6438,6437],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Feminist Misconceptions Marginalize Mutual Pleasure and Sexual Equality","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What does a feminist look like?

As a sexually active human being, it is your duty to constantly question your beliefs and actions with regard to the equality of the sexes.

You cannot talk about them like they don’t deserve your respect. If you want to have hot, steamy sex, I guarantee you will not get it from a woman you don’t value, or at least not one who is worth your time. Do not be ashamed to be called a feminist. If you love women, love their bodies, urges, minds and power, defend their right to have those passions and free will.</p>\n<p>Of course there are dozens of branches of the feminist movement, and not all will agree with my opinions. I am not a radical activist; I believe in a sexually liberal feminism that brings attention not to the dominance of male control and desire, but to the equality of human sexuality. I also know there are many religious readers out there who disagree with any form of promiscuity, but I encourage those people to find a feminist position that complements their faith. Feminist theology is a broadly researched and written-on topic, so don’t let your disgust with my opinions keep you from connecting with your chance to mobilize.</p>\n<p>I would like to propose a new way of thinking — a kind of “sexy feminism.” It’s 2011 for goodness sake; look how far we’ve come! Certainly we can all agree that equality of the sexes is not embodied by an unattractive person we don’t want to fuck because he/she is too busy picketing instead of showering. It is totally hot to feel wanted, needed and respected for my body and my mind — mutual acceptance is a turn-on.</p>\n<p>So please, find the feminist within. The power to respect is blind to sex and gender. Bring out your desire to set people’s minds straight. And absolutely never let someone tell you that sleeping around makes you a slut. Girls, I am here to tell you that sucking on cock, fulfilling your fetish fantasies, getting titty-fucked and being bent over and railed are all within the boundaries of being proud to be a woman and an activist for women’s rights.</p>\n<p>Safe sex is the most important priority. After that, sluttiness just doesn’t exist.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/","id":6435,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6434,6433,6432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Valentine’s Day: For Love or Lust?","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"So what’s thepremise of thisholiday again?

A littlenaked flying cherub babyis shooting harmless peoplewith a medieval war weapon toconfuse their sense of free willin commemoration of an entirelyunrelated Greek Orthodox traditionbased on the name of some saint? Yeah,fuck it, let’s celebrate. And while we’rerejoicing in our passions and love for ourcompanions, everyone else can just grab a tubof petroleum jelly and alternate between fits ofdepression and masturbation all day. Okay, beforewe get too cynical here about doves and rose petalsand gooey chocolate, I think it’s time we turned thatlonely-heart’s frown, upside-down.In the magical kingdom of Isla Vista, Valentine’sDay is an equal opportunity holiday. We can allhave our stupid heart-shaped expression candy andeat it too. I mean honestly, those littlesweethearts are quite theconversation starter inand of themselves. It’slike a cheaper wayto booty-call textthat also tastesdelicious— “kissm e , ”“ h o tstuff,” “sof i n e . ”It’s toogood not totake advantageof in some vulgar,offensive way.The following is a two-partguide to easy and fun ways to makeValentine’s Day well, easy and fun, whether you’rehitched or flying solo. Remember, Choose Your OwnAdventure books?If you want to see how to make the person you areexclusively sleeping with smile, go to option 1.If you want to see how to take advantage of the inevitableself-consciousness and loneliness this day spurns and casuallysleep with someone, go to option 2.1) Lovers, this is a day to rejoice and revel in yourmelting heart and regular lay. It’s a day to spoil yourmate and get spoiled back with yummy kisses anddiamonds and yachts. And of course, it’s a day tomake sweet, passionate love to your beau. So yourrapidly increasing college education fees are gettingin the way of buying that special gift? Well Yudof,you can ruin our bank account statements but youcan’t keep us from our romance!The beauty of love is, when it’s real, it can bedone and enjoyed on a budget. In the midst of aneconomic recession, there’s nothing more romanticthan thoughts from the heart — seriously. Writedown how you feel and seal it with a kiss, snuggle upand watch your favorite movies all night, relive yourfirst date or your first sexual experience together, meltdown some cheap chocolate for some yum and somefun. Keep it real boys, that’s all she wants. And girls,show him what you love so much about him and whyyou find him so sexy. Oh, and lingerie wouldn’t hurt.2) Ah yes, the party-of-one crowd. Well, you maynot be getting a box of chocolates or a love poem thisyear. But hey, love is in the air, so go outside andtake a whiff. I’m not saying you should be creepyand go out on the prowl for sad loners, but thebeautiful thing about Valentine’s Day is it remindsus of how nice it is to have someone to hold, andthe person you’re holding doesn’t have to be “theone” for you to feel good.Being single is fun and you can’t let this day makeyou forget that. I’ll be taking my valentine Mr. Vibratorout on a private date between my legs, and I’m notashamed of that. Couples get one day of the year to becute and sexy and romantic, and we singles get 364 toact randomly on our horny urges. Now I’m not usuallythe biggest advocate for having a fuck buddy, but comeon people, it’s V-Day! Find someone to hate love with;it may not be romantic but it sure as hell will be hot.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36816\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36816\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/","id":3537,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[3536,3535,3534],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bodily Nether Regions Need Not Be Neglected in Sexual Exploration","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What if I told you there was still an undiscovered foreign land just waiting for the next Columbus to conquer it?

However you may be, or be with someone who is, and I’m here to tell you that wanting a finger, toy, shaft or tongue up your ass is completely healthy. Actually, it’s an urge that would be a shame not to satisfy.</p>\n<p>I know most of the funniest sexual things to joke about involve the asshole or the shit thereon, around and all over some girl’s chest. But there’s so much more to a butthole than rusty trombones, dirty sanchezes, cleveland steamers, blumpkins and donkey punches. When it comes to anal stimulation, there’s really nothing to fear but the fear of getting shat on itself. That is, except when it comes to “2 girls 1 cup.” You should actually be very afraid of that and should cry enough tears to erase any damage done to your eyeballs from witnessing it. A small part of my soul slowly curled up and died when I was forced to watch that.</p>\n<p>Anal sex is something all guys want to do because their favorite porn involves ass stuffing, but most girls are frightened to even consider the thought. To that dichotomy, all I have to say is one word: lubricant. A lot of it. Actually, just squeeze that entire tube on there, buddy. Even though you’re enjoying the shit out of your dick getting strangled, she’s in pain and regretting being open-minded enough for you to get down.</p>\n<p>Now I know you probably haven’t said the word butt-plug since you were on the elementary school playground, but it’s actually a sex toy that many use and enjoy. And if the idea of plugging your ass up is appealing to you, you might be one of these people. And why stop there? It’s literally a black hole, so why not try anal beads or even large rods if you’re feeling particularly loose in the ass that day?</p>\n<p>Have I completely grossed you out yet? If you made it this far, you can probably handle the inevitable rim job discussion that’s about to go down. You know when you’re sitting down at dinner, just enjoying your meal and company, but something just doesn’t seem quite right? The mood is good and you’ve got your proteins and vegetables and beverage, but you ask yourself, “What is missing?” Oh yes, of course — a giant asshole in my face!</p>\n<p>Now I’m not one of these people either, so I honestly can’t tell you if this is a common turn-on. Sometimes when I walk down the street, I wonder if everyone is secretly going home and licking each other’s assholes. But if you’ve got a craving, I think it’s time you tossed that salad.</p>\n<p>So ask yourself, “When was the last time I touched a butthole?” And if it’s been a while, maybe you should consider touching one sometime in the near future.

Why do I begin this discussion with nuts over shaft, you may ask? Because friend, testicles are genitalia too, and quite frankly, they’re sick of constantly being neglected. They feel overshadowed by their cylindrical counterpart, doomed to a life of always the ballsmaid and never the dong. As long as you’re gentle, don’t be afraid to lightly massage them, lick them or even pop one in your mouth for a quick soak. They are very sensitive, which is a double-edged sword. Do nothing extreme, or he’ll tear up in sheer anger. But the right touch can take him over the edge.</p>\n<p>Tip. There is a reason why “just the tip” is actually appealing to a guy, as that’s where he feels most of his pleasure. Don’t forget to come up for air every once in a while to avoid passing out while giving his tip some one-on-one time. And this little tip from me to you leads me to my next point…</p>\n<p>Deep-throating. OK girls, take a deep breath (through your nose), you can do this. Try to think of a distant place, like a tropical beach or some other beautiful I.V. equivalent, and imagine you are there instead of esophagus-deep in johnson. The reason why guys are obsessed with you doing this is two-fold: 1) Again, the tip gets stimulated, but this time by the inside of your body, and 2) Porn.</p>\n<p>Hands. Unless you’re tied up or handcuffed — in which case, more power to you — your hands should always serve as the supporting actors in your one-mouth-show performance. A penis doesn’t exactly have the resistance of a bar of lead, but it can handle quite a bit of pumping and pressure. Basically, hold on tight kids, ‘cause this is going to be a bumpy ride.</p>\n<p>Eyes. Look up at him (also porn).</p>\n<p>Teeth. The age-old question: To use teeth or not to use teeth? That’s a direct Shakespeare quote, by the way. The ol’ vampire blowjob. There are two schools of thought on this matter. Some say even trying is bound to end badly. And well, others like it rough. Just keep in mind that you aren’t grating cheese here, and it isn’t exactly the kind of thing you want to be biting into anyway.</p>\n<p>Jizzing. “Spit or swallow” is so five-minutes-ago. There are so many more creative ways to skeet and so many more interesting things to skeet on. Of course, swallowing is still an option if that’s your cup of semen. But consider this — and yes, I know this is also rooted in years of boy-on-computer alone-time memories with a sock — ask him to come on you. The chest and face seem to be popular choices, and might I add that it is a surprisingly refreshing exfoliant. Just keep your eyes closed or this sacred advice will land you in the emergency room with an embarrassing medical bill to explain.</p>\n<p>So open wide and say “ahh,” you are now equipped with the advice to give an outstanding oral performance. Don’t get choked up, put your member where your mouth is and rock that fellacio like it’s 1999.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32703\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32703\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/","id":6436,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6435,6434,6433],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Wise Women Indifferent to the Extra Long Schlong","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If you were to order the perfect dick, what would it look like?

I honestly don’t think I could say exactly. Maybe: no abnormalities, clean, well-proportioned? I’m not looking for a prince-of-the-ball-schlong here, just a handsome contender who knows what he’s doing. What I can assure you does not pop up into my brainstorm bubble is an overwhelmingly large, long, obese penis with a heaping side of engorged meatballs. Think what you will, women just don’t sit around all day fantasizing about being suffocated by a surplus of flesh or painfully walking around like an extra-large dildo was wedged up their asses the night before.</p>\n<p>I know it’s a cliché topic to address, but I can’t say it enough: Size really doesn’t matter — unless you make it matter. If you are constantly thinking about how you don’t size up or how he won’t fill you up, you’ll never come to the realization that sex is ultimately about pleasure, and a big shaft does not equal the big O. Of course, if you were gifted with said giant penis, don’t worry — you don’t have to put up a personals ad for “man seeking woman with enormous vagina to settle down, must like dogs.” Read on, and I’ll tell you why.</p>\n<p>The massive amount of pressure men are under to live up to some dream dick size is extremely unfair, and more importantly, unfounded. First, physically speaking, there is really no advantage to an above-average sized penis, since only the first few inches of the female vagina are pleasure-sensitive. Also, the vagina has an amazing ability to expand and retract, which means the feeling of being “tight” doesn’t require a ten-pound tuna. (And big boys, with enough breathing exercises and moisture, you’ll get it in).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>True, there are women who will talk about how they love a big ol’ one-eyed snake to get the job done, but that is a fetish and should not be confused with every woman’s expectations. And if you are one of these women who badger men with a smaller dish to bring to the table, be sure to keep in mind that though he may laugh it off, it is a very sensitive issue that can be traumatizing for a man.</p>\n<p>Of course, we ladies are in no way immune to society’s obsession with size. Women too are burdened with feeling self-conscious about the size and shape of their breasts, which should be seen as just another beautiful part of a person’s body, not a green light or deal-breaker. However, we have to understand that this pressure is so much different for a man. For a guy, performance in the bedroom is directly connected to self-esteem and self-worth, and having a small organ to begin with can be a stressful starting point. So start by communicating, making him feel more than adequate enough to get your juices flowing.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying “the greatest things come in the smallest packages” necessarily applies here. Rather, “don’t judge a book by its cover.” If you respect the person you are hooking up with, which I am praying that you do, give them a chance to prove your stereotypes wrong. The fact is, all men are not created equal, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Imagination and creativity is not restricted to the shape or size of our body parts.</p>\n<p>Now let’s get some specifics down. I’m sure you’ve all heard expressions like, “It’s not the size of the boat, but the motion of the ocean.” Well, if you are a man who feels inadequately built, try focusing on multiple points of stimulation. Show her that you are strong and can pick her up and move her around. Use your hands to feel her hair, her body, her clit. Even if she was at all caught up about your size, that will all change as soon as you impress her with your ability to arouse her entire body.</p>\n<p>So please, allow these suggestions to shrink your worries about what is really the tiniest of problems. You say less-than-average penis, I say more-than-usual opportunity.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32271\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32271\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/","id":6333,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6332,6331,6330],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"More Than Friends, Less Than Fun","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Aristotle once said, “Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies.” A poetic, moving assessment, but I have to wonder: Did Aristotle ever decide to fuck one of these friends he was renting ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Aristotle once said, “Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies.” A poetic, moving assessment, but I have to wonder: Did Aristotle ever decide to fuck one of these friends he was renting half of his soul out to? Because homie-to-homie penetration is really more than just one penis dwelling in two bodies. Let’s be real here — fuck buddies are a fun concept for a Judd Apatow flick, but railing your friends is not the cure for a lonely and horny heart. Keep the booty calls to acquaintances and you’ll be fine, but bend over for a bestie and you’ll be getting fucked in more than one way.</p>\n<p>If a beneficial friendship is a means of enrichment and support, why is it that having friends with benefits turns comfort into complication? And what are these new and exciting “benefits” I’m getting from my friends? Are loyalty and amity no longer enough? Must we have our friends and eat them out too?</p>\n<p>It’s a grey area, a sexual limbo of sorts. If he’s having a bad day, you’re not sure if you should give him a hug or head. And if it’s that time of the month, you don’t know whether to lend her some Advil or ask her if she’s down anyway. It’s a danger zone, people, and it ain’t easy getting out of it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The alleged “benefit” of having a friend with benefits is sexual stimulation and release without the responsibilities of an emotional relationship — which generally implies sacrifice of self, commitment, emotional exchange and of course, monogamy. You may be thinking: “I can get my dick wet with someone I like hanging out with, no attachment necessary? What’s the catch?” Answer: Contrary to the popular belief that you have a cock for a brain, you’re a human with feelings. Sorry to pop your “I’m so strong I can fuck like a primal beast programmed to inseminate without attachment” cherry, but with coitus comes closeness. No ifs, ands or best friends’ butts about it.</p>\n<p>So what are we so afraid of that we opt for the nearest physical contact over a committed relationship? Well, let’s look at what a relationship entails: couple-y activities, pillow talk, family functions, calling the morning after, stress, making plans for the future, moving into the out-loud farting zone, oh dear this sounds horrible. Okay, okay; you win. Pal pooning definitely takes the prize. Just do me a favor and be cautious of which homedogs you’re dogging.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, if you are comfortable enough to consider someone a good friend, then you are vulnerable enough around them to give in emotionally. This is not to say that beautiful, healthy relationships can’t form out of friendships. On the contrary, they do all the time. My point is in the distinction between building a sexual relationship and fucking. You can date a buddy you have sex with, but it just doesn’t work with a fuck buddy. See the difference?</p>\n<p>Having a secret crush on someone you’re already sleeping with is dangerous territory. It’s like craving your favorite food while you’re chewing it — seriously confusing. It doesn’t take a Facebook update to know that if it feels complicated, it’s complicated, even if “casually fucking my friend” isn’t a relationship status as of yet.</p>\n<p>So why fuel the friendly fling fire? Two options: This person either secretly loves you and wants to use sexual intimacy as a crutch on the way to something more serious, or is a commitment-phobe and wants to use your body as a hollow shell to fuck his/her problems away. Do yourself a favor and step away from the insecure trap of loneliness and draw the line between people you hang with and people you bang with.</p>\n<p>My advice: Become friends with the people you fuck, not the other way around. And to all of you strangers out there who have “friended” me, take note on where I stand.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31377\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31377\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/","id":6434,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6433,6432,6431],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Painfully Awkward and Awkardly Painful","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Boys, I need to talk to you about the years of pain I have endured at the cost of your hands.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Boys, I need to talk to you about the years of pain I have endured at the cost of your hands.

You squeeze your eyes shut thinking of how much better this experience would be if you were choking your own chicken, and count one moment of pleasure for every handful of discomforts and skin snags. Now, I’m not saying mutual masturbation is unnecessary, in the least.

You may pleasure me, rub me and pet me, but I beg you to put an end to jabbing your phalanges into my hole and hammering my clit. Don’t think I don’t get your intention; the mood is hot, she’s moistening up like a towelette and it’s time to pump up the pussy volume with some groin groping. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But the feeling of getting your clit rubbed is so overwhelmingly potent that when you flick and tug it around town, I promise you she is secretly counting the seconds until the battery ends.

It never fails, no matter how much practice, constructive criticism and improvement, every time I slip my hands down a guy’s pants to harden things up, I feel like I’m in middle school again; which is why I think it’s time for a more adult approach to the handjob. Correct me if I’m wrong, but it’s my understanding that the only real appeal of a handjob is the fact that someone else is giving it to you, even though you can do the same yourself. Well girls, the next time you’re pumping the living hell out of his poor shaft, consider some more advanced monkey spanking by making the experience something he couldn’t do alone — add some dirty pillow talk, simultaneous stimulation on different parts of the body, lubricant, ball massaging, etc.</p>\n<p>So are we doomed to a lifetime of strictly face-to-genitals foreplay where erotic touching becomes obsolete? Step aside Darwin, because mutual masturbation doesn’t have to be fazed out, just dramatically improved through the most essential hookup ingredient: communication. I’m not telling you to preface your time between the sheets with a blunt, “Excuse me, how would you like to be jerked and/or jacked off this evening?” Rather, use sexy whispers to tell your partner what feels great and what is actually borderline painful. It is not offensive to tell someone to slow down, speed up or move their hand in a certain way that makes you tingle. And if you’re angry at me for bitching you out without giving you specific advice, here’s my response: Only your partner can tell you how to make second base a hole-in-one for him or her. Trust me, if you can learn to talk it out, the touch may even have the potential to surpass the blow.</p>\n<p>The ultimatum: Put your hands to good use or whip out that tongue, because there’s nothing less satisfying than taking a beat-up car for a ride.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/painfully-awkward-awkardly-painful/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/painfully-awkward-awkardly-painful/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/painfully-awkward-awkardly-painful/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/painfully-awkward-awkardly-painful/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-17/painfully-awkward-awkardly-painful/","id":871,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[870,869,868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why Your Dirty Little Secret Should Be Celebrated","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"One of my favorite shows is “Entourage,” despite its depressingly poignant way of reminding me that all of the fancy luxuries in my life are lacking.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One of my favorite shows is “Entourage,” despite its depressingly poignant way of reminding me that all of the fancy luxuries in my life are lacking.

Of course her presence on the show stimulated me to investigate her more mature content performances, and I have to say, I’m impressed.

We’re sexual creatures with healthy appetites for nasty shit just like you). I am by no means an addict, and I would never turn down physical intimacy with a partner to click my mouse alone, but I do watch porn and enjoy it very much. </p>\n<p>It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, and furthermore, it can be a healthy way to connect with your deepest sexual desires and turn-ons. The key is not to allow virtual imagery to completely overtake your fleshy fantasies in the sack and to separate yourself from the oversimplified categorization most e-porn is based in. If you find that you absolutely cannot ejaculate anymore until you watch a bald, pregnant midget squirt her puss-juice in public, you might have a problem.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On a more local level of XXX on the WWW, we at UCSB are lucky enough to host an academic outlet for our skin-flick obsessions, largely thanks to faculty member Constance Penley, who has devoted much of her research to sexually explicit media and pornography. Yes, she’s that badass professor you’ve heard about who teaches a class devoted entirely to porn, but she also happens to be one of the most brilliant and engaging lecturers I’ve ever had the opportunity to listen to. What’s intriguing is that she studies and discusses something we’ve all been raised to crave yet scorned to enjoy.</p>\n<p>So why study pornography? Is it so we can actually beat off during lecture instead of wasting our time with Sudoku? Not quite. Porn is worth anal-yzing because it is more than just a teenage secret hidden in a wad of tissues. Pornographic material is entertaining, motivating, wide-ranging and dare I say, culturally valuable. It is at once escapist and hyperpersonal. In fact, the only thing it is definitely not is something to be ashamed of.</p>\n<p>Why then do society, largely governmental bodies and religious moralists equate the modern cyber masturbator with nothing more than a dirty leper guilty of criminal behavior? I believe the fundamental issue here is the vague nature of the idea of obscenity. I personally think it’s indecent and vulgar to spend 10 straight hours in front of a screen playing World of Warcraft. How is video game indulgence any more dangerous or crude than me rubbing one out to some onscreen bodily fluid exchange? Think about that one the next time you’re jiggling your joystick.</p>\n<p>Now that I’ve rationalized your porno-mania, before you use this newspaper to wipe the jizzle off your screen, let’s think about why you like what you like when you’re on a late night date with your computer and your hand. Since it is by definition meant to be vulgar, I tend to relate the porn films I like to the genre of horror. The scariest movies always capture my most wretched, unimaginable fears, so in turn, the pornography I enjoy usually depicts my most extreme, degrading, borderline unreasonable desires.</p>\n<p>What I want to get across is, if you feel grossed out about something you’re naturally turned on by, don’t take it so literally. Just remember that it’s meant to be hyperbolic — you don’t have to be hungry for some ass-stretching double-stuffage during your next hookup to enjoy watching it online.</p>\n<p>So sit back, pop in your Pirates collector’s edition disk and grab a hold of that lubed-up junk. Because the only unjust thing about watching porn is hogging your roommate’s bandwidth.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/","id":6400,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6399,6398,6397],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How Our Generation’s Popular Music Fuels Promiscuity on the Dance Floor and in the Bedroom","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“I got a feeling” that you have more than once been lured into a party by the pounding rhythms that make Isla Vista’s heart beat, danced until the stiff air made you sweat and found a rando to g...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“I got a feeling” that you have more than once been lured into a party by the pounding rhythms that make Isla Vista’s heart beat, danced until the stiff air made you sweat and found a rando to grind up against so hard it would make a strumpet blush.

Then suddenly I was given a sign from above, and it came in the form of David Guetta. He spoke directly to me, telling me what I needed to know — that I’m a “sexy bitch.” I was like, David, you’re right, I am a sexy bitch. It was so convincing that the beat made my genitals engorge enough to realize that this drug that keeps us backing that ass up is in the music (although Ke$ha might argue that it’s your love). LMFAO has a way of making me take more shots than anyone really needs — I “say ahh, throw my hands up in the air” and the next thing I know I’m doing some horribly offensive Helen Keller dance and suddenly feel like “making love in this club” to a guy who really wants nothing more than to “break my heart.” All I want is someone to “teach me how to jerk” and/or “dougie,” and I end up with a “rude boy” who thinks he’s “cooler than me” in an instantly “bad romance.”</p>\n<p>I get it, sex sells, but have you listened to some of these popular songs recently? I think Chris Brown is responsible for more conceptions than beatings. Is it really necessary to specify that in addition to my neck and back, I would also like you to lick my pussy and crack? And how kind of you to let me lick your lollipop and remind me that my sexual urges are no more advanced than a Discovery Channel mammal in heat. What happened to comparing me to a summer’s day?

The right sex mix can be like the perfect garnish — you may not notice that it’s there, but if it isn’t, you’re like, “where’s my fucking parsley?”</p>\n<p>Just like any good movie, you need levels that build you up to a climax. Start off with some slow jams to get the mojo flowin’ and move into something rough and tough for the main course. Maybe kick it off with some throwbacks — Dr. Dre, not O-Town — and move into anything but Justin Bieber that has a good baseline, unless a three and a half minute reminder of pre-pubescence and hair products makes you randy. Just remember, techno is more fun for the club than the chubb-rub, so keep the rhythm grind-able. Ladies and gentlemen, start your iPods.</p>\n<p>I guess it boils down to this: Pop music lyrics are unromantic, blunt and offensive, but they get you laid. So here’s a big “fuck you” to the music industry from my feminist side and a kind-hearted “thank you” from a horny college chick dancing her way into a bedroom near you. Now “don’t cha” wish you could nail this “promiscuous” girl?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/generations-popular-music-fuels-promiscuity-dance-floor-bedroom/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/generations-popular-music-fuels-promiscuity-dance-floor-bedroom/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/generations-popular-music-fuels-promiscuity-dance-floor-bedroom/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/generations-popular-music-fuels-promiscuity-dance-floor-bedroom/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/generations-popular-music-fuels-promiscuity-dance-floor-bedroom/","id":6452,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6451,6450,6449],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/336"}},"__N_SSG":true}
