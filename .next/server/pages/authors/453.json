However, of the two mobs, I honestly find the Miller-Young mob to be far more worrisome. The Deltopia riot was leaderless and meaningless, chaos for the sake of chaos. When the police attempt to close a street full of 15,000 drunk revelers, many of them out-of-towners with no loyalty to our community, a riot is all but inevitable.</p>\n<p>The Miller-Young attack, on the other hand, was not leaderless or meaningless. It was led by one of our professors. Rather than setting an example of tolerance for the opposition, and restraint in the face of provocative views, she set an example of violent censorship. And, although actions have elicited criminal charges and have been denounced by Vice Chancellor Michael Young, far too many students and professors at our university have lionized Miller-Young into an unfairly accused victim. One online petition, with nearly 2,000 signatures, demands that UCSB “issue a statement of support” for the professor who belittled and assaulted a 16-year-old girl, expresses “love &amp; solidarity to Professor Miller-Young” as a “womyn of color,” and asks that school policy be changed to remove triggering (read: unpopular) speech.</p>\n<p>As a UCSB student, I am more ashamed of our reaction to the Miller-Young incident than I am of the Deltopia riot.</p>\n<p>Even many of those who denounced Professor Miller-Young still blamed the protestors for provoking her to anger. The same people who are so fond of constantly haranguing everyone about the fact that there are no excuses for rape might do well to keep in mind that there are also no excuses for violent censorship — “she was asking for it” just doesn’t cut it in this case anymore than it does in cases of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>People have pointed the finger at a number of possible causes for the Deltopia riots — the influx of out-of-towners, the recent installation of security cameras in Isla Vista, poor handling of the noise ordinance announcement by the police and local government. Allow me to point the finger at another possible contributing factor: Mireille Miller-Young and the students and faculty who supported her.</p>\n<p>Mob psychology can be extremely powerful. As someone who witnessed part of the riots on Saturday night, I can say that the excitement in the air was palpable and there was a definite temptation to abandon all reason and revel in the chaos. Of course, another (and I’m proud to say much larger) part of me was horrified at the pointless destruction — but if I had believed that the ruckus and mayhem could be carried out in pursuit of a higher cause, it might have been a different story. Getting to smash stuff and justify it in the name of social justice — what could be more fun? For many immature people, letting loose one’s most primeval destructive energy and being lionized for it is the ultimate win-win, and many student riots start this way. Thrill-seekers go looking for a good time, knowing they can justify their actions by saying they were sticking it to the man or fighting for Rodney King or trying to help destroy the military industrial complex which is hurting those poor Palestinians and Iraqis, which I’m sure the overgrown children smashing store windows and stealing stuff care soooo much about.</p>\n<p>The partygoers who rioted Saturday night did not have any ostensible higher justification to fall back on, but the attackers led by Professor Miller-Young did. Operating on their most primitive impulses, they claimed instead to be acting from their most noble beliefs. When confronted with a view in opposition to yours, coming up with a rebuttal is hard — It takes work and brainpower. But raging at them, verbally and physically attacking them and stealing their property — that’s easy, and it’s also fun! Who cares about some noble abstraction like free speech, when you can fuck shit up in the moment? And why should you think twice, when you know that you will probably not face serious consequences for your actions? If the “Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust” were a little less litigious, Professor Miller-Young would be in no trouble at all. She would have received a half-assed denouncement of her actions from the school, and a good deal of public hatred that would have been more than offset by the hordes of social justice warriors making her into their latest sick role model.</p>\n<p>And when UCSB students learn by example that they can form violent mobs and get away with it … is it really any surprise, what happened in Isla Vista the other night?</p>\n<p><em>Jason Garshfield is a second-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

If the UC system had waited until the beginning of summer to announce the schedule change, most students probably would have shrugged it off. But instead, they chose the worst possible time to spring this news on us: two weeks into Winter Quarter, right when we were all wishing Winter Break was still going on. Not the greatest time to say, “Oh, by the way, you’re only getting two weeks off next year! Hope that’s all right with you. No hard feelings, eh?” Grrrr…</p>\n<p>This isn’t a question of <i>how much</i> time off we get.

It is a schedule of extremes ­- long stretches of schoolwork, and then long stretches of time off. During the school year, we work pretty much straight through nine months. Then, after that academic baby has come to term, we’re suddenly facing more vacation time than we know what to do with: A summer break that stretches out over four months. What the hell am I supposed to do with a summer that long? Rewrite the Constitution?</p>\n<p>And now, thanks to the UC Registrars, we have yet another week tacked onto that already-too-long summer, and, simultaneously, one fewer week during Winter Break that we could use to lighten the load during the school year when we actually need it…</p>\n<p>Winter Break is not about Christmas. I, a Jewish-born atheist who has never celebrated Christmas, am very unhappy about this change, despite having no religious holiday to celebrate. Why? Because Winter Break, like the Christmas holiday itself, is merely a symptom of the winter solstice. Even at moderate latitudes, the waning winter sun has a pronounced effect on the human psyche. It causes significant percentages of people (myself included) to experience the winter blues, and causes many more to feel at least somewhat sluggish and unmotivated. (This isn’t news. We all hate the last week of Fall Quarter.) Winter is the time of year when our biological clock is telling us to crawl into a cave and hibernate. Or, in more human terms, curl up in front of the fire with a good book.</p>\n<p>The bleakness of this time of year is the reason why we celebrate Christmas – a Pagan-derived holiday based around tranquility, familial love, and the rebirth of the sun – only four days after the solstice, and it is also why we take far more vacation time, and attach far more symbolic meaning to Christmas, than would be necessary if it were just another holiday. And if you take away our hibernation time, we’ll be as grumpy as a bear if you woke it in the winter.</p>\n<p>Others have pointed out the unfair favoritism of changing the school schedule in order to accommodate a religious minority. Let’s be clear: anti-Semitism is a serious form of hatred. The very word brings to mind ghastly images of gas chambers, villages burning in pogroms and “A Resolution To Divest From Companies That Profit From Apartheid.” But lacking official observance of Jewish holidays is not anti-Semitism in any sense whatsoever. It’s life, and part of attending a secular public university.</p>\n<p>If I were in a more acerbic mood, I might consider asking my fellow Jews to make the small concession of moving the High Holy Days to the week of December 14, 2014, so that everyone can be happy … but I don’t want to completely blow my chances of ever going on a Birthright trip, so I’ll avoid going down that road, and instead ask the age old question: Is this good for the Jews?</p>\n<p>No, it isn’t. We didn’t ask for this schedule change. And since it was dropped into our lap, it’s hard for observant Jews to not be happy about it. People everywhere are quick to rage against injustice, until it favors them. That’s normal and human. But if we do take advantage of a small injustice that favors us, and shout down anyone who disagrees as an anti-Semite, then will that really generate goodwill and endear the students of this university to the Jewish community?</p>\n<p>To the UC Registrars I can only say this: Please reverse this ridiculous schedule change at once.

The first was titled “Campus, Community Groups Run Campaign Against Sexual Assault.” The second was a “Left Said” opinion piece on drone strikes. Although these two articles seem unrelated at first glance, a closer examination reveals a subtle and worrisome theme tying the two together.</p>\n<p>In “Left Said,” Michael Dean wrote an article critical of American drone strikes in foreign countries. He criticized the racism implicit in our drone policy which allows the government to “reduce” the civilian death toll by writing off “combatants” as all young men killed by drones “who fit a certain phenotype” (i.e. who are Arabs).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But while Dean and others have pointed out the unwritten racism of such a policy, they fail to point out the written misandry. U.S. policy lists young men as combatants. Imagine, if you will, what would happen if it were to become known that U.S. policy called for killing women of military age. People would riot in the streets and drone strikes would be halted tomorrow.</p>\n<p>What does the drone example teach us? Men are warriors and men are disposable. Even in 2013, we are still expected to die in wars. Just as the Selective Service Act requires all American young men to register for the draft, Pakistani young men are indirectly “drafted” by our foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Drone policy also reveals our society’s presumption of male culpability. Men are guilty. This presumption is the reason why men receive longer prison sentences for the same crimes. It is why black men in the Jim Crow South could be lynched based solely on a white woman’s accusation of rape. It is why we can ignore male domestic violence victims, and dismiss male victims of crime by saying that “men committed the violence.” (Would we dare say the same thing about minorities or the poor?) And this ties into the second article, the one concerning sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Just as young Pakistani men are seen as terrorists, young American men are seen as rapists. Of course, sexual violence is a very serious problem, and I do not believe that the people who are trying to stop it have anything other than the noblest intentions. But I worry that they may be doing more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Take, for instance, the signs by the bike paths — the “excuses” used to justify rape. What exactly do these signs hope to accomplish? What good will it do to remind students of rape every day while biking to class? I doubt the signs will stop a single sexual assault, but they will constantly remind female students of their supposed vulnerability and powerlessness — while at the same time wagging a finger at male students, reminding us of our potential violence and criminality.</p>\n<p>The article says that the signs are meant to “open up conversation on sexual violence,” so allow me to add an alternate perspective to the conversation. Do with it what you will.</p>\n<p>One sign says, “She said no but meant yes.” The problem is, a 1988 study by Texas A&amp;M University found that 39.3 percent of college women had at some point said “no” when they meant “yes.” Another excuse reads, “We were both so drunk.” This one is even more problematic; if we extend the definition of rape to include consensual sex while drunk, then I suspect the majority of Isla Vistans are guilty. And what if both the man and woman are drunk? Do they simultaneously rape each other? If the woman is not responsible for her actions while drunk, why should the man be? And, most importantly, does the woman feel raped? In many cases of consensual drunk sex, I would suspect that the answer is no.</p>\n<p>In the words of Dr. Warren Farrell, “Laws against date rape with broad definitions are like 55-mile-per-hour speed limits — by making everyone a violator, they trivialize those who are real violators.”</p>\n<p>American men do not live in the shadow of drones, but the principle is the same. We are the guilty ones. At the dawn of the 21st century, we live under a burden of original sin more subtle than anything the Church ever concocted.</p>\n<p><em>Jason Garshfield is a first-year undeclared major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>The article appeared online only at <em>dailynexus.com</em> on Monday, February 25, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50307\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50307\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/from-drone-strike-policy-to-campus-rape-awareness-campaigns-musings-on-male-culpability-in-the-21st-century/","id":5961,"author":{"id":453,"name":"Jason Garshfield"},"related":[5960,5959,5958],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Prop 37 Fails, California Blows Chance to Stand Up to Corporate Giants","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Four years ago, California had a chance to be the first state to vote in favor of legalizing gay marriage.

I supported 37 in part because I was fed up with watching big businesses successfully slander good propositions. Two years ago, big alcohol (not wanting to have to compete with marijuana for your intoxication) funded all those commercials trashing the integrity of hardworking California physicians like my dad by suggesting that they’d come to work stoned if Prop 19 passed. Last June, big tobacco was responsible for steamrolling to death Prop 29 (the tax on cigarettes for cancer research, if you’ll remember) with confusing and misleading propaganda. The sociopathic behemoths of tobacco who make their fortunes poisoning people thought we would be stupid enough to listen to them.</p>\n<p>Only we were. And although I had higher hopes for Prop 37, it seems the people of California were once again duped into voting against their best interest. Only a month before the election, Prop 37 was leading in a landslide. Before the propaganda storm began, California voters knew that it was a good measure. Nobody was trying to ban GMOs. We only wanted the same labeling standards that Europe and China demand of their corporations. But once multinational agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto started up the propaganda machine, people began to change their minds, and Prop 37 was narrowly defeated by voters on Election Day.</p>\n<p>They had to go out on a limb to destroy this one, though. Prop 37 was as near-perfect as legislation can be, and the extreme silliness of the ‘No’ campaign proves it. Although they made an issue of “exemptions,” food in restaurants is never labeled. (If 37 had required labeling of GM restaurant foods, you can bet the ‘No’ campaign would have been whining instead about inconsistency.) And the assertion that Prop 37 would cost consumers four hundred dollars a year was an outright lie, originating with the anti-recycling firm Northbridge Consulting. An independent economic analysis done by Joanna Shepherd-Bailey, Ph.D. of the Emory University School of Law found that there would have been no costs to consumers.</p>\n<p>So, are GMOs actually dangerous? I’d say the jury’s still out. Good information on the safety of GMOs is hard to find, in part because much of the info available has been corrupted by corporate money. (Conveniently, labeling GMOs would have made studying their effects on humans much easier.) According to the FDA, the deputy commissioner of which is a former Monsanto lawyer, GMOs are safe. Sounds perfectly legit to me.</p>\n<p>It should be clear to us all by now that the only “badly worded” part of Prop 37 involved the words “right to know.” No law with those words will ever pass the Monsanto acid test.</p>\n<p>Some would argue that the general public is too gullible and easily frightened by talk of “Frankenfoods” to be trusted with hefty decisions about what to put in our own bodies.  But with GMOs shrouded in secrecy, what else should one expect? Maybe if corporations were straightforward and honest with the public for a change, we might be a little less suspicious. Don’t expect us to implicitly trust you, Monsanto, not after you and your cohorts just spent 50 million dollars to keep us in the dark. Prove yourselves. Don’t hide if you have nothing to fear.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 6, California chose to relinquish its choice. A sinister and litigious corporation succeeded in convincing us of our own stupidity and incompetence. In the process, a great blow was struck against the free market. Consumers must be able to make real, informed choices for the “invisible hand” to work properly. If Prop 37 had passed, we all would have been able to walk into grocery stores, look at the labels on food packages and know for sure what we were eating. It would have been empowering. We had our chance, and we opted for powerlessness.</p>\n<p>California, you blew it again. Enjoy your GMOs.
