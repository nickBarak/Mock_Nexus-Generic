Well, don’t worry, you are not alone!</p>\n<p>I’m an open person, and I express my love for sex because there’s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of if you’re safe! It’s okay to have sex and it’s okay to freely express yourself and your sex life (I mean only if that’s your thing and you’re comfortable with doing so). But there are people out there who judge the scandalous lives of the Isla Vista dwellers based on promiscuity, making some feel less comfortable about asking questions about having sex.

And being as open as I am, all eyes were on me when it came to rehashing our weekend adventures — the good, the quick and the ugly.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the quality, I was always open to talk sex with my friends because sex in college and during our adolescent years can be fantastic (worth talking about) or it can be downright hilarious due to the general lack of experience (perhaps even more worthy of rehashing). If you get pleasured right, you’ll want the world to know too, trust me. And if you’re getting pleasured wrong (aka, not pleasured at all), all you want to do is laugh about “That One Time When…” Basically, I always felt that talking sex gave me the opportunity to turn a terrible experience into a funny one.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are some things one should keep to themselves, and most people know right away when that line is being crossed. For example, one of the basic rules I like to stick to is never, ever demean anyone; we all have bad sex sometimes, but that’s no excuse for talking shit. However, when it’s casual, why not discuss it with friends? I am a female, and the last thing I want to be is called a “slut” or to feel shame-faced when people realize I am not the Virgin Mary. I love who I am, and every person should; loving your sexuality is okay! Sex can be fun and pleasurable — most of the time — but if you feel ashamed to be doing it, don’t do it. Just don’t judge a person for loving their sex life, because different things work for different people.</p>\n<p>Talking about it isn’t for everyone, but it really does help to have a person that you trust to talk about stuff. It keeps the head in balance and keeps the mind free of all of the worries that a one-night stand can bring. Sometimes, it’s as simple as needing your best friend to reassure you (even falsely) that the guy or girl from last night was a definite 10. And sometimes, your conversations can delve as deep as exploring your sexuality further, or talking out any problems that have arisen in the bedroom with a third party.</p>\n<p>Essentially, being able to talk about sex with someone can not only give you peace of mind, but can also give you insight into expanding your sexual horizons. Communication is key, so stop let’s judging and start conversing.</p>\n<p><em>Wendy Doer wants to talk about sex, baaaaby.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, April 9, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

However, there is always the big question that takes up residence in my head when I’ve just had an enjoyable night — do I stay or do I go? As a girl with intimacy issues, my head is almost always saying “GO,” but let’s explore the pros and cons of both sides.</p>\n<p>After a one-night stand, the last thing I want to do is wake up to a person I’ve just met, so of course, I usually tend to do the whole, “sneak out as soon as he’s asleep” thing. Because no matter how much fun you just had, no one really wants to do the walk of shame — well, I know I don’t. The problem with the Walk of Shame is that the better you looked the night before, the more embarrassing your walk home will be in the morning. By the light of day, that little black dress and the remnants of a smoky eye will have you praying that rather than recognizing you, people will just mistake you for a confused I.V. raccoon. By the way, guys, you have no idea how good you have it.</p>\n<p>However, I’ve also had times where I’ve had to stay the night, simply because the sex was so good that walking home afterwards didn’t seem possible without falling asleep halfway home, or because the prospect of calling a CSO to pick me up from my booty call just seemed like it’d be too awkward. But for this situation, lemme recommend you turn that Walk of Shame into a Stride of Pride, no matter what the night before was like. Own that messy hair and makeup. Walk down DP rather than shrinking down Sabado or Trigo. Heck, go take advantage of the Walk of Shame special at South Coast Deli.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So when you’re dealing with one-night stands or casual hookups, it seems that there will always be the inevitable questions of, “How do I ask them to leave without being rude?” or, “How do I let them know that I want them to spend the night?” Well, I think I can safely say that I have been on either side of both encounters: having to ask a person to leave my bed, inviting him to stay, knowing when it’s time for me to leave, being asked to stay and not wanting to, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>For someone who struggles with intimacy issues, the question of how to nicely kick someone out is too real. I know that I hate it when a guy attempts to spend the night in my bed; it’s already too small for me, so what makes you think I’d want to share it with you? So how does one kick a person out? For one, don’t be afraid to voice how you feel. This is your bed and if you want it to yourself, that’s your prerogative. But obviously, you want to try to drive them away in the most respectful manner possible; you never know when you might want to hit them up again. When in doubt, the simple, “I’m really tired and I have an early day tomorrow; the last thing I’d want to do is wake you up early,” usually works like a charm. We college students really value our sleep.</p>\n<p>But if you want the best chances of sleeping in your own bed without having to share it, I shall quote the wise words of YG: “Toot It and Boot It.” Maybe having your prize of the night go back to your place isn’t actually the smartest idea — go to theirs so you can sneak out without the guilt of feeling terrible for asking them to leave. Sex is fun (hopefully), but if you don’t want to stay the night, get out. The last thing I want for a partner is for them to feel forced to stay the night just because I had sex with them. I know that cuddling is fun for some, but you might as well save that for your body pillow because I’m not interested.</p>\n<p>And then there are the problems that come with dating a person for a while: taking it slow, and finally deciding to sleep together. Do you stay or do you go? Most people would say stay, obviously; you’ve been dating them, so why not? Yeah, I see where you’re coming from, but that’s not me. As previously mentioned, I like my bed to myself. And even if I’m dating a guy, getting me into bed is one thing but getting me to stay is wholly another. I say this because as a woman, it takes a lot for me to look my best and if I’ve just started dating you, I only want you to see me when I’m a 10. Therefore I can’t stay the night — while bedhead and last night’s makeup look good on some, as I’ve mentioned before, I feel that I tend to look less than desirable the morning after. Furthermore, I don’t see a problem with not wanting to spend the night with a partner — who wants to wake up with their morning breath in your face or their snoring loudly in your ear? As cynical as this may sound, I do believe that there’s nothing more exhilarating than caring about a person and exposing yourself to them. But until we get to that point in our relationship, I’m not interested.</p>\n<p>So, while the perks of dating a person can include being truly honest and intimate with your partner (including about how bad you look the next morning), the perks of one-night stands are not caring about leaving after the deed has been done. So yes, sometimes a sacrifice has to be made in order to expand your sexual horizons, but the thrill of leaving a freshly worn-out bed can be oh so fun. So let me enjoy myself and let me pleasure you, and then let us part our ways because I don’t want to wake up to you; sorry ’bout it.</p>\n<p><em>Wendy Doer has nothing but sympathy for the raccoons of Isla Vista.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

However, men seem to harbor no shame about the fact that, yeah, they masturbate. So why do women still tend to feel discouraged to explore their lady parts? Why does it feel so taboo to learn your own body?</p>\n<p>I can say that I subscribed to this dichotomy between the sexes for so long because I was embarrassed and afraid that it was “wrong” to touch myself or to use toys to help get me going (if you know what I mean). It isn’t necessarily the most common thing for women to do, nor does it tend to be discussed in the same way that men so openly talk about it, but undeniably, there is a large number of women who masturbate regularly.</p>\n<p>I was thinking to myself, “If I don’t know what I like, how will I be able to tell future lovers how to properly please me?” Most women have no idea what an orgasm feels like, and I didn’t want to be one of the many who have never received such pleasure. So, of course, like the human that I am, I asked Google what would be the best way to achieve proper climax, because obviously Google has the answers to everything, ever. This was when I learned that, although a man can help, you must first learn how to be comfortable with your own body, which entails self-exploration. One way that they suggest you can start exploring is by considering the idea of investing in sex toys. Yes girls, I said it — sex toys.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Going off of Google’s recommendation, I began researching different kinds of sex toys. And if you didn’t know — because I had no idea — there is an extremely wide variety of vibrators and I came (*wink wink*) upon a world of possibility, a world that I never knew existed. It was like my own personal <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> experience and boy, was I excited!</p>\n<p>There were beginner vibrators, which were very traditional, simply vibrating as you place them onto your clitoris, until at last they reach an intensity to make you climax like you’ve never felt before. Or there are more advanced sex toys, like the Luna Beads which are a pair of ball-shaped objects that you insert and then go about your daily business. For those of you who have read<em> 50 Shades of Grey</em>, I’m sure you know full well what these lovely beads are. They create this lovely tugging sensation that seems to pull from a dark place of pleasure, without even having to use it on your clitoris or do any work yourself. It’s as though your libido is on fire with burning pleasure and completely relaxed at the same time. All you need to do is a little bit of walking, and there is nothing wrong with a little bit of walking, I mean a little exercise never hurt anybody. If you’re having a bad day, what better way to brighten it than to use your new Luna Beads and clean the house? I can tell you now that cleaning will never be the same again.</p>\n<p>After experimenting with these two toys is when I first discovered that orgasms truly were as great as those screaming girls in porn make it seem and that I never wanted to experience another sexual encounter without an orgasm again. So yes, women have as much of a right to orgasm as men do! And if you ever have to question whether or not you’ve orgasmed, there’s a good chance that you haven’t because you will know when it happens. That’s when you will realize the magic you have been missing out on.</p>\n<p>This first experience is especially important in college because some men are still learning what they’re doing, and the best thing you can do for yourself and your partner is to teach him or her what you like. And the only way to teach is to know what you like, right?</p>\n<p>Change your sex life. Use toys! Explore yourself and reach climaxes like you’ve never felt. It can’t hurt to find your sexual preferences and realize how much more fun you could have been having all along. If nothing else, you can feel like you’ve done women everywhere a service in teaching someone else the proper way to please a woman. That’s the worst that can happen. At best, you get your mind blown several times over. Sex is great, but so much better when you know what you’re doing.</p>\n<p>I don’t recommend advertising your love for sex toys to everyone you meet — it may scare some people away and then you’ll be stuck with your toys for the night. As fun as they are, they’re no substitute for the real thing. They’re pretty lonely. But you’ll know when and where to bring it up. Find a consistent buddy who can help you climax with or without your toys because, although masturbation is a beautiful thing, sometimes it’s fun and sexy when you’re using your pleasure toys with another person.</p>\n<p>The moral of the story, ladies? Invest. Learn yourself, learn what you like. What can you lose from a little one-on-one time? I can say now: Best Investment Ever.</p>\n<p><em>Wendy Doer knows what she’s doing tonight.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, January 22, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
