Great moments in sports photography sometimes happen in less than one one-thousandth of a second. Within that extremely narrow time frame, given the proper equipment and timing (one part skill, two parts serendipity), a photographer can capture the essentials of story-telling with a photograph. An athlete’s pose and facial expression are obvious components of a good shot. Underrated but also important in composing a picture that engages the reader and complements a story are the little details. For instance, when the flakes of powder a snowboarder kicks up or the chunks of rubber a soccer player disrupts on a turf field. The same little details, such as a runner casually spitting as she races, can disqualify a photo from being front page material, unless perhaps the story was on the new trend of tobacco chewing on the womens’ cross country team.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31767\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31767\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/","id":2159,"author":{"id":326,"name":"Jon Kopecky"},"related":[2158,2157,2156],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/326"}},"__N_SSG":true}
