Police said shortly after turning the woman away, the apartment complex office received approximately 10 verbally abusive phone calls from who was believed to be the woman’s boyfriend.</p>\n<p>At approximately 2 a.m. a window at the office was broken. The Resident Coordinator thought the woman and her boyfriend were responsible for the damage and called the police.</p>\n<p>The next morning, UCPD officers questioned both suspects who then admitted to the abusive phone calls but denied breaking the window. The incident is still under investigation.</p>\n<p>DP’s That Way, Dude</p>\n<p>Wednesday, June 23, 10:56 p.m.: UCPD officers responded to a disturbance at the loading dock of Carrillo Dining Commons. They found a male UCSB student stumbling around the area and displaying signs of inebriation.</p>\n<p>When officers approached the suspect, he said “I’m drunk and I’m lost.” The man then said he had no idea how he got there.</p>\n<p>Officers determined the man was too drunk to care for his own safety and arrested him for public intoxication. He was taken to the Santa Barbara County Jail pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Classroom Faucet</p>\n<p>Thursday, June 24, 3:26 p.m.: Officers responded to a call from Buchanan Hall where a male UCSB student stood up and urinated in the classroom during the middle of a movie.</p>\n<p>When officers arrived they determined the man was inebriated, even though he admitted to drinking “only a little wine.” The officers did not find any alcohol on the suspect, but they did find a puddle of urine on the classroom floor.</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication and taken to Santa Barbara County Jail pending sobriety. Officers said they could not charge the suspect with urinating in public because they did not witness the act.</p>\n<p>Tag ‘N Snag</p>\n<p>Friday, June 25, 3 p.m.: Officers received reports of five suspects spraying graffiti on a hand ball court next to the UCSB lacrosse field in broad daylight. When police arrived, the suspects fled on foot and four of the suspects were captured and arrested.</p>\n<p>Police later determined the suspects stole the spray paint from a nearby storage shed. The suspects were mostly minors from the Goleta area. All four were charged with conspiracy to commit burglary, burglary, vandalism and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p>Cop Beater</p>\n<p>Saturday, June 26, 1:53 a.m.: A disturbance was reported on the corner of El Greco Road and Embarcadero del Norte where a man was allegedly throwing bottles. The man fled the scene when the UCPD arrived and several officers gave chase. One officer was injured while apprehending the suspect, but police did not release the extent of his injuries.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for assaulting a police officer and fleeing from the police. Police said both charges are misdemeanors, but are punishable by up to one year in jail and may include additional fines.</p>\n<p>Cycle of Mayhem</p>\n<p>Saturday, June 26, 2:53 a.m.: Officers observed a male UCSB student riding a bicycle toward them near Picasso Road. Although they instructed the man to ride around them, the suspect swerved off the road and fell off the bicycle, nearly hitting the officers.</p>\n<p>The officers determined the suspect was under the influence of alcohol and arrested him for biking under the influence. The suspect was taken to the Santa Barbara County Jail pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-7746\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-06-30/uc-police-blotter-june-30-2004/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-7746\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-06-30/uc-police-blotter-june-30-2004/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-06-30/uc-police-blotter-june-30-2004/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-06-30/uc-police-blotter-june-30-2004/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2004-06-30/uc-police-blotter-june-30-2004/","id":2540,"author":{"id":268,"name":"Max Rasovsky"},"related":[2539,2538,2537],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/268"}},"__N_SSG":true}
