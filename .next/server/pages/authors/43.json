This year, the Terrapins have made easy work of their opponents through the NCAA Tournament thus far, achieving shutouts in all matches.</p>\n<p>Despite the story told by the numbers, No. 11 Maryland has knocked off nationally-ranked programs along the way. Most notably perhaps, is the Terps’ 1-0 victory over No. 3 Kentucky last Friday, Nov. 30. Not only shutting out the third-ranked team in the nation, but also doing so on the Wildcat’s home turf in Lexington demonstrates the momentum Maryland is riding heading into this year’s Final Four.</p>\n<p>Given Maryland’s success in the postseason this year, it may be assumed the team has been prospering since the season’s start in August. Contrarily, the Terps didn’t pick up their first win until they hosted West Virginia at home on Sep. 10, roughly two-and-a-half weeks into the season. Prior to its 1-0 shutout win over the Mountaineers, Maryland held a 0-2-2 record. Obviously an undesirable start for any team, the Terps still find themselves at the College Cup, thriving nonetheless.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After the team’s shaky start, Maryland has managed to culminate an 11-6-4 overall record; however, the narrative of the Terps’ season encompasses an element of growth. An overtime loss at home to Big Ten foe Wisconsin in September found the Terps deflated, sitting sub-.500 once again.</p>\n<p>The loss came only a week after Maryland earned its second consecutive win of the year to get to .500. Whether or not the Terrapins knew in September that they’d return to racking up consecutive wins when it mattered or not, the team bounced back from the Wisconsin loss, going 9-3-2 to reach the biggest stage of college soccer.</p>\n<p>Through their rejuvenation following the loss to the Badgers, the Terrapins mustered a 4-4 record in the competitive Big Ten conference. At the top of the Big Ten, this season is Indiana, boasting a perfect 8-0-0 conference record as part of its 20-2-1 overall record.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, the Hoosiers are who stand in Maryland’s way now as the two conference opponents are set to face off for the third time this season. This time, though, the stakes are much higher.</p>\n<p>Back in October, Indiana defeated the Terps 2-1, but November saw Maryland settle for a 1-1 tie against the Hoosiers in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament. It is since that 1-1 tie that the Terps have achieved three consecutive NCAA Tournament shutouts.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned victory over Kentucky stands as the most recent of upsets for Maryland, but a week prior to the taming of the Wildcats found the Terps defeating No. 10 Duke at home 2-0. The Blue Devils had no answer for Maryland, as they were met with the same fate that Kentucky arrived at a week later.</p>\n<p>The Terps may have an inclination to spoil opposing fans’ hopes on the road, but Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara will perhaps offer an even greater outcome to be coveted.</p>\n<p>Along with two winless games worth of potential revenge, the Terps have the opportunity to knock off the kingpin of the Big Ten and the second-ranked team in the country on Friday night. The Hoosiers will undoubtedly aim to prove why they’re deserving of their unblemished 8-0-0 conference record; however, Maryland is a different, more nuanced team heading into the match.</p>\n<p>Led primarily by senior midfielder Amar Sejdic, Maryland boasts a balanced attacking core featuring junior forward/midfielder Paul Bin alongside Sejdic. Sejdic in his senior year has started all 19 games for the Terps and leads the team with six goals off of 54 shots.</p>\n<p>Despite the hefty amount of misses implied in the midfielder’s shooting statistics, it’s clear Sejdic is comfortable taking the lead and will undoubtedly be looked for on the offensive side of things Friday night.</p>\n<p>While clearly a prominent part of Maryland’s offensive gameplan, Sejdic remains without a goal in this year’s two games against Indiana. Likely drawing ample and deserved attention from the Hoosiers on Friday, Sejdic will perhaps open up chances for teammates like Bin to exploit.</p>\n<p>In October’s loss to Indiana, Bin scored the lone goal for Maryland, so he will look to find the back of the net again. With four goals and two assists, Bin sits behind Sejdic in scoring but ranks second on the team in efficiency. In contrast to Sejdic’s 54 shots, Bin has tallied only 26.</p>\n<p>While Sejdic and Bin have been responsible for 12 of Maryland’s goals this season, the Terps’ roster holds three other players who have scored at least two goals on the year. This balanced scoring potential, as well as experience, might be expected at this stage of the postseason, but it provides Maryland the luxury to trust their offensive sets and find the net organically rather than play hero ball.</p>\n<p>Heading into Friday’s game against Indiana, Maryland has the opportunity to knock out a Hoosier team responsible for two winless matches, but the Terps are playing for much more than revenge. Despite the tantalizing element of revenge, Maryland looks for a more rewarding outcome of playing for the College Cup Championship.</p>\n<p>With revenge as well as championship aspirations on the line, the Terrapins will face Indiana at 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 7 at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85320\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85320\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/","id":1330,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1329,1328,1327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Athlete Spotlight: Redshirt Junior Outside Hitter Lindsey Ruddins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ruddins-Pic-e1540446884273.jpeg?resize=256%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ruddins-Pic-e1540446884273.jpeg?resize=256%2C320&ssl=1","description":"Having just earned her fourth Big West Player of the Week honors this season, women's volleyball star Lindsey Ruddins steps into the Nexus' Athlete Spotlight.

The team suffered their most recent loss at home to No. 3 Stanford last Saturday, effectively ending its four-game winning streak; however, the Gauchos’ 12-win total is double that of any other team’s in the Gold Coast Conference (GCC).</p>\n<p>Behind UCSB in the conference standings are Long Beach and Pepperdine, both sitting at 6-4 overall. Although Santa Barbara has played more games than its conference foes, three of the team’s 12 wins have come against fellow GCC teams (Long Beach, Pacific and Pepperdine).</p>\n<p>UCSB has again moved through the national rankings this year, reaching the No. 5 spot in the latest week’s poll. After losing senior standouts Shane Hauschild and Reed Cotterill from last year, someone on the Gauchos’ roster was going to have to fill the scoring void left behind. Lucky for Santa Barbara, both Borislav Jovanovic and Ivan Gvozdanovic returned this season, and have been dominating the pool. The Serbian duo has been instrumental to the Gauchos’ success thus far, but it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise to anyone who followed the team last season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Both Jovanovic and Gvozdanovic played a large role aside Hauschild and Cotterill last year, and have continued their impact. As of statistics last updated on September 11th, Jovanovic leads his team with 26 goals off 50 shots. In the Gauchos’ overtime win against Pepperdine this month, Jovanovic scored 6 goals, again proving his outright scoring ability. His performance earned the senior driver GCC Player of the Week honors for the third straight week on September 20th, a feat no other player has achieved in history.<br>\nWithout a doubt, Jovanovic will be crucial to maintaining the Gauchos’ momentum heading into league competition, but the depth on the Santa Barbara roster is likely a pleasant sign for head coach Wolf Wigo.</p>\n<p>Behind Jovanovic is the junior utility player Gvozdanovic, with 12 goals and 10 assists, but seven other players have combined for double digit scoring contributions, including redshirt sophomore Leo Yuno. Yuno, an attacker with only one less goal than Gvozdanovic, completes the triple-threat of UCSB’s offensive ability.</p>\n<p>Another good sign for Coach Wigo is that the team’s four losses have all come at the hands of Pac-12 leaders: No. 1 USC, No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Stanford, and No. 4 California. After its home loss to Stanford, Santa Barbara will get another chance against a top-ranked opponent this Sunday when the Gauchos visit USC. Despite losing to the Trojans 11-3 on September 15th, the Gauchos have both a shot at redemption and at avoiding a two-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Whether or not they can knock off the No. 1 team in the country, the Gauchos have plenty to be confident about heading into GCC games next month. And, with Jovanovic’s play showing no signs of slowing down, the team has a comfortable go-to option in crunchtime, as already displayed by UCSB’s overtime victory against Pepperdine.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the September 27th print edition of the Daily Nexus on page 06.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While King II, who averaged a double-double of 15.6 points and 10.2 boards per contest, won’t be on the court with the Gauchos this season, his production demonstrates the immediate impact that recruited transfers can have for a team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be especially important for UCSB. Despite losing four senior starters and seven seniors in total, Pasternack has brought in another talented class of recruits, highlighted by game-ready transfers capable of keeping Santa Barbara’s momentum alive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had the biggest turnaround in NCAA history last year from six wins to 23 wins, and a big part of that is the students,” Pasternack continued. “When I first got here April 4, 2017, I said I wanted to build this program where everyone in the community of Santa Barbara and, most importantly, the students would make this their home court advantage.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger’s lights-out shooting will surely bring fans to their feet again this season, filling the Thunderdome with new life. Home court advantage was real for the Gauchos last season, as they won 11 straight at the Thunderdome to start the season and ended 12-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coach Pasternack hopes to see the same kind of energy at home this season and will likely be putting together more enticing giveaways closer to the start of the regular season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Towards the end of the year, whether it was Irvine at home or the last game of the year, specifically Cal Poly, there was nothing like it; the energy and excitement in the Thunderdome was unbelievable. It was definitely a sixth man for us and I can’t tell you how important that is for our players to have the Thunderdome packed every night no matter who we’re playing. For our program, that’s our goal: to fill the Thunderdome each night,” said Pasternack. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s no substitute for a packed Thunderdome when the Gauchos hit a three in transition, so it says a lot for Pasternack and his staff to be so invested in the students and fans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While another 17-win jump is simply impossible, the culture of the Thunderdome is back. And with momentum from last year’s success, the Gauchos are prepared for another remarkable season.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83888\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83888\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/","id":997,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[996,995,994],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How ESPN Ruined The 2018 NBA Draft","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-06-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=640%2C360&ssl=1","description":"With this year's NBA draft said and done, it's time to criticize just how it was said and done.

But ESPN’s presentation of the 2018 NBA draft stood out from their previous blunders in ways that left me wondering how anyone else was taking in the barrel of chum that was this year’s coverage. A few looks at social media confirmed that I’m not crazy (take that, my therapist), and also not the only one to cringe at every forced player comparison made and blatantly-misguided interview question asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s unfortunate that any draft day should warrant this kind of criticism because, after all, it should be about the players selected, a majority of whom are younger than half of UCSB’s undergrads. In fact, 11 of 14 players selected in this year’s lottery are 19 or younger. ESPN should not only highlight these newcomers but should provide insightful basketball analysis, instead of reality-TV content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any analysis, especially insightful, is a stretch for today’s ESPN, but some of last night’s commentary was simply disappointing. The top prospects of this year have been talked about for months now, so there was a real opportunity presented for the network to capture the long-awaited selections with a dialogue pointing to the next step for the draftees and their respective franchises. Instead, the well-known highlights of each player were reiterated with little acknowledgement of where the players were headed. It doesn’t take the notion of draft night to once again explain Deandre Ayton’s athleticism, or Luka Doncic’s success overseas. On draft night, it should be about what’s next for them in the league. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the immediate moments following the announced destination of each prospect, the chance to talk NBA basketball was missed. In the case of Ayton, a player expected to go No. 1 in the draft for quite a while, his destination was only touched upon. The Suns have exceptional young talent to welcome Ayton; however, the brief mention of Ayton’s future teammates was underwhelming and hardly informative. Perhaps the aspect of time between picks hampored any detailed analysis, so maybe the section of the show devoted to player introductions should’ve been a time for actual NBA commentary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Player introductions, which were done for the first (and hopefully last) time in draft history last night, should’ve been the first sign of botched coverage. Most of the expected lottery picks were featured walking down the stage with family members or friends alongside them, which is great for celebrating the players, except every player already gets plenty of camera time once the actual draft begins. Players are shown, oftentimes with their friends and family, awaiting picks at their tables, on stage with commissioner Adam Silver, being interviewed after they’re picked, and the abundance of media obligations awaiting them after their interviews. Why would the players need even more screen-time? Because the ESPN commentators actually have that little of importance to say. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"766937373\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83582\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83583\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/2018-nba-draft-logo-640x360/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640×360\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83583\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning with Chauncey Billups, who earned my respect as a player during his Detroit years, Billups’ segment of player comparisons was terrible and frankly a waste of time. It’s understandable why comparing young draft picks to past and present NBA players is helpful in characterizing a players’ potential, but some comparisons appeared forced and few were reasonable. Aside from the weird trend of matching the race of pick and compared player, Billups failed to match playstyles altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jaren Jackson Jr., selected fourth, was compared to Joakim Noah. As Billups made this comparison, Jackson Jr.’s highlights were shown with him spreading the floor and hitting threes. Joakim Noah, as anyone who’s watched him play should know, isn’t a big three point shooter, or shooter in general. Noah has an NBA career three point percentage of 0.00. Billups had to have done some preparation for the top prospects and their comparisons, and obviously it’s uncertain how every draftee will turn out, but some of his choices made it seem like he was drawing names out of segregated hats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the racially-aligned player comparisons weren’t awkward enough, the post-draft interviews for each player picked up the slack. After being picked, shaking the commissioners’ hand and walking across the stage, the players then faced a barrage of poor interview questions. Simply pointless questions regarding “the moment” and “what their team can expect” were repeated for each pick, with equally repetitive answers. How else are they supposed to feel? They just got drafted by an NBA team as a teenager, we’re sure that’s awful. And immediately after being drafted they had to sell themselves as a player again? It was ridiculous and a blatant move by ESPN trying to generate drama.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing out among the interviews was Colin Sexton’s. Following his selection at 8th overall by Cleveland, Sexton was coaxed by the interviewer to make a pitch for LeBron to stay. Talk about awkward. Anything the Cavs do to retain The King will likely include packaging their newest draft pick in a trade for another star, just like they did with Andrew Wiggins in 2014. As if Sexton was supposed to say, ‘LeBron please stay, I promise I’ll know the score during the final seconds of a playoff game.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of it all, ESPN reporter and columnist Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted out virtually every pick before it happened, which only cheapens the draft coverage itself even further. Maybe my sports expectations are too high for a Disney-owned company, and maybe the point of the show is to be just that, a show. But, the difficulty of finding non-conglomerate, real-time draft news should indicate where the dominating national sports coverage is heading. If the NBA draft is developing into a reality show, how soon until other ESPN/ABC (both Disney) NBA events like All-Star Weekend and End of Year Awards are ruined? Oh wait. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/","id":1849,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1848,1847,1846],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Following First-Round Bye, UCSB WBB Is Set to Face CSUN in 1st Game Of Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The hunt for the title begins as the UCSB women's basketball team goes head-to-head against No. 7 seeded LBSU tonight in the second round of the Big West Conference Tournament.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following its loss to No. 8 Hawaii in the final game of the regular season, the UCSB women’s basketball team will travel to Fullerton, Calif., where they’ll be awaiting their second-round matchup. The Gauchos finished fourth in the Big West at 9-7 and closed out the season 12-16 overall. Considering that this team preparing for a playoff run lost nine games in a row earlier this season is remarkable and demonstrates Santa Barbara’s ability to adapt as well as the coaching staff’s ability to get the best out of players over the course of a season.</p>\n<p>“This time of year you have to be familiar and dust off the cobwebs,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Knowing personnel sets what we need to do. It’s more about your effort, your activity level, your energy and your toughness at this point. We’ve got to manufacture some offense from the free-throw line and in transition.”</p>\n<p>Due to the interesting playoff format of the Big West, UCSB doesn’t actually have a set opponent yet. The Gauchos have a bye for round one, in which teams seeded 5-8 will compete. Out of those four teams (No. 5 CSUN versus No. 8 Hawaii, No. 6 UC Riverside versus No. 7 LBSU), the two winners will advance to play either UCSB or No. 3 UC Irvine. Santa Barbara will take on the highest seed to advance while Irvine will take on the lowest. First place UC Davis as well as second place Cal Poly each receive a double-bye and will await the winners of the UCSB and Irvine games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[The season] really has played itself out to be an exciting week in tournament play because of so many single-digit games. Everybody’s got to show up and produce and bring what they can bring, and that gives you a chance” said Henrickson.</p>\n<p>Because UCSB is forced to play the highest-seeded team to advance, the Gauchos are able to rule out No. 8 Hawaii from the equation. This means that following Tuesday night’s games, the Gauchos will be met by either CSU Northridge, Riverside or Long Beach in Wednesday night’s matchup. During the conference season, the Gauchos split the series 1-1 with both Northridge and Riverside while defeating Long Beach in both meetings.</p>\n<p>Despite losing both regular-season games to the Gauchos, Long Beach (6-10, 8-22 overall) is on a five-game winning streak that saw the 49ers take down their scheduled opponent for Tuesday night, UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders (6-10, 9-21 overall), in spite of falling to Long Beach in the two teams’ most recent meeting, closed out their regular season with a 76-62 win over top-seeded UC Davis, the Aggies’ second loss in conference play.</p>\n<p>For Riverside, the timely win broke its three-game losing streak and saw the Highlanders’ two leading scorers, senior guard Michelle Curry and redshirt senior guard Lauren Holt, combine for 43 points.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos can rule out facing Hawaii in the second round, they know they’ll play Northridge (8-8, 15-15 overall) given that the Matadors win against the Rainbow Wahine. Northridge’s Channon Fluker, a junior center and the Big West Player of the Year for the second consecutive season, leads the Big West in rebounds, double-doubles, blocked shots and free throws made.</p>\n<p>The Matadors obviously rely on Fluker on both ends of the floor, as she’s also averaged 18.9 points per game. On Jan. 31, Northridge defeated UCSB in the Thunderdome 48-30, a game in which Fluker had 15 points, 12 boards and 5 blocks. The Gauchos were held to their lowest field-goal percentage in program history, converting on only 20.3 percent of shots.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t attack, we took some ill-advised shots, but we’ve got to get some touches in the paint, some kick-outs and some rhythm,” said Henrickson. “We need to execute down the stretch, get them off the glass.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos dropped their final regular season game in Hawaii, Santa Barbara holds a determined mindset heading into the postseason.</p>\n<p>“It’s not who you play, it’s not where you play, it’s how you play,” continued Henrickson. “And you’ve got to own your how. You’ve got to be dialed in, you’ve got to know what you’re doing, you’ve got to be disciplined. We’ve got to be committed to making fewer mistakes and forcing mistakes on the other end.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face either Riverside, Long Beach or Northridge on Wednesday, March 7, with tip-off scheduled for 8:30 p.m. With a win, UCSB advances to face either UC Davis or Cal Poly in the semifinals. Games will be broadcast on ESPN3 as the Gauchos aim to return to the Championship, where they lost to Long Beach last year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81810\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81810\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/","id":969,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[968,967,966],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Visit Hawaii To Close Out Conference Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With a win against Hawaii, the Gauchos could lock up a top-four seed for the Big West Tournament and finish with a 13-15 overall mark.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_81651\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"805762819\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81683\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81651\" data-attachment-id=\"81651\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/mira-shulman-looks-for-a-teammate-to-pass-to-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mira Shulman looks for a teammate to pass to.

The Rainbow Wahine are looking to bounce back after a road loss to Long Beach State over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCSB will hope to defeat Hawai’i for the fourth time in a row, as Hawai’i’s last win over Santa Barbara took place in the 2015-2016 season.</p>\n<p>Crucial to UCSB’s success in the Big West this season has been redshirt senior Drew Edelman. The 6’4” forward is averaging a double-double in conference play with 16.9 points per game and 10.9 rebounds per game, while shooting 60.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>In addition to her offensive efficiency, Edelman has scored in double figures against Big West opponents in all but two games this season.</p>\n<p>“I told her a few weeks ago just how proud I was of her,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Just being able to maintain poise and composure because she gets a lot of attention, a lot of traffic, a lot of physicality. She’s done a really good job of handling that pressure and not playing backwards because of a missed call or bad call.”</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ home victory over Riverside, Edelman led her team with 27 points, tying her season high for points in a single game. Luckily for UCSB, Edelman’s other 27-point game this season came against none other than Hawai’i.</p>\n<p>In their visit to the Thunderdome on Feb. 3, the Rainbow Wahine were outrebounded 32-26 by the Gauchos and outscored in the paint 42-27, a sign of Edelman’s significant paint presence on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>A concern for the Gauchos will be whether or not they can replicate their efficient shooting against Hawai’i, since Santa Barbara shot 48 percent overall, 50 percent from beyond the arc and 90 percent from the free-throw line in the last meeting.</p>\n<p>For Hawai’i, disrupting UCSB’s offense early and limiting Edelman’s paint touches will be key, but the Rainbow Wahine have a weapon of their own: Sarah Toeaina.</p>\n<p>In her senior season, guard Toeaina is averaging 16 points per game and 6.1 rebounds per contest while shooting 51.5 percent overall from the field. Toeaina scored 25 points in Hawai’i’s latest visit to the Thunderdome, and the senior has drawn high praise from coach Henrickson.</p>\n<p>“She’s a kid who really competes. She’s composed and has a great mid-range game. She gets on the offensive glass and gets out in transition, so we’ve got our hands full, we’ve got to be prepared.” Henrickson said. “We need to limit where they like to catch it, what shots they like to get, where they’re most efficient and be more disruptive in that action. She leads the league in free-throw attempts, she’s coming off a game where she had 19 against Long Beach State. That’s not the answer because now she’s scoring while she’s resting.”</p>\n<p>Toeaina will certainly be a tough assignment for the Santa Barbara guards and help defenders; however, one of UCSB’s freshman guards, Sarah Bates, has drawn praise from her head coach as well.</p>\n<p>Averaging 13.6 points per game in Big West competition, Bates is the Gauchos’ second-leading scorer and knocks down 43.8 percent of shots from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“In a role where she’s played a ton of minutes, and we’ve needed her to do a lot of different things for us,” Henrickson said. “She’s been able to step up and answer that which has been important for us.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West Tournament scheduled for next week, Thursday’s game marks the last of the regular season, but UCSB remains focused on what’s next.</p>\n<p>“This time of the year we’re just trying to eliminate game slippage and understand what our responsibilities are to find success,” Henrickson said. “We want to build momentum off the other night and build momentum getting a road win and be able to get as many conference wins before the tournament since we’ve been here, which is a little milestone for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on Hawai’i on Thursday, March 1, with tip-off scheduled for 9 p.m. at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 1,</em><em> 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Led by five Gauchos finishing in double-digit scoring, the UCSB women’s basketball team snapped UC Irvine’s seven-game win streak, defeating the Anteaters 82-55. The Gauchos came to play Saturday night, demonstrating confidence and a new sense of direction during their blowout of the second-place Anteaters.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t stop attacking,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We stayed aggressive and we buckled down and still defended when we couldn’t score. Those two things we haven’t been consistent with but we were pretty good tonight. We kept our foot on the gas pedal.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have won their last three games and are now tied with rival Cal Poly for third in the Big West at 8-5 in conference play and 11-14 overall. With the loss, Irvine remains second in the Big West standings at 9-3 and 17-9 overall.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A barrage of scoring late in the first quarter and into the second gave Santa Barbara its early lead. Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman tallied another double-double with apparent ease as she recorded 12 points and 15 rebounds. It was Edelman’s fourht double-double finish in the team’s last five games.</p>\n<p>Fellow redshirt senior point guard Drea Toler joined Edelman with a double-double of her own that featured 10 points and 10 assists.</p>\n<p>Makala Roper’s game-high 15 points combined with Sarah Bates’ 11 and Sarah Porter’s 12 put the game out of reach for Irvine.</p>\n<p>In the first quarter, both teams got into foul trouble early, as Bates picked up two fouls and Irvine’s star junior guard Morgan Green got called for her third foul around the five minute mark.</p>\n<p>An odd display of foul calls paired with back and forth scoring resulted in Santa Barbara and Irvine being tied at 12 following a jumper by Roper with 3:10 remaining in the quarter.</p>\n<p>A minute later, Irvine took the lead via freshman forward Jordan Sanders’ mid-range jumper. Unfortunately for Irvine, Sanders’ shot would be the Anteaters’ last field goal until 4:22 remained in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Down 14-12, the Gauchos flipped the script on Irvine in a huge way. Sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez sunk a three to start the scoring-frenzy for Santa Barbara, which featured two more threes from Roper, an Edelman layup and a Tal Sahar buzzer-beating corner three to close out the quarter up 26-15.</p>\n<p>UCSB started the second quarter on a 9-0 run as part of its 23-1 run carried over from the end of the first.</p>\n<p>Edelman scored six-straight herself and another Sahar three-ball made it 35-15 in favor of the Gauchos. Down 20, Irvine finally got a shot to fall junior guard when Andee Ritter knocked down a jumper.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters made just 3 of their 13 shot attempts in the quarter but avoided the 20-point deficit at halftime, as they trailed 40-24. Irvine’s struggle to scoring nine points in the quarter was due much credit to UCSB’s defensive prowess during the game as the Anteaters had reached triple digits in scoring twice in their last three games.</p>\n<p>After sitting out for the entirety of the second quarter with two fouls, Bates knocked down a three to start the second half and followed it up with a jumper for five-straight points.</p>\n<p>The freshman guard Bates continues to impress this season, as she scored 7 of her 12 points in the third to maintain the Gauchos comfortable lead.</p>\n<p>Haleigh Talbert knocked down a jumper for Irvine just over the 6-minute mark and a 9-6 run by Irvine put the Anteaters within 18 to start the fourth.</p>\n<p>The final quarter opened with yet another bucket from beyond the arc via Roper, extending UCSB’s lead to 21. Sophomore center Natalia Bruening gave the Gauchos good production off the bench, as she scored five points in the fourth and allowed Henrickson to rest Edelman when needed.</p>\n<p>Bruening’s layup and then another Roper three-pointer gave UCSB a 24-point lead with still over 8 minutes remaining. A short burst of scoring from Irvine placed the Anteaters within 16 at the 6-minute mark, but their Hack-a-Shaq strategy of fouling Drea Toler everytime she got the ball didn’t play out well for them.</p>\n<p>UCSB made 13-of-22 free throws in the fourth quarter to secure the win down the stretch. Toler herself was 8-14 from the line and had 10 points as part of UCSB’s 29-point quarter. Despite managing a 20-point quarter as a team, Irvine simply couldn’t catch up to the hot-handed Gauchos, falling 82-55.</p>\n<p>Morgan Green, who came into the game averaging 24.5 points per game, got locked down by UCSB. The Gauchos switched on screens to contain Green and forced her into 9 turnovers on 0-8 shooting from three.</p>\n<p>“Morgan Green, who’s so explosive and such a good one-on-one player, obviously between Drea and [Akilah Jennings] they did a really good job,”Henrickson said.“We did a really good job of not fouling her, we were much more disciplined.”</p>\n<p>Green led her team with 13 points on a less-than efficient night finding the net. Irvine shot 29.9 percent from the field and only 10.5 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara outrebounded Irvine 51-37 and outscored the Anteaters in the paint 24-18, but it was UCSB’s capitalization off turnovers that separated the two teams. While UCSB committed 22 turnovers, Irvine turned those turnovers into only 13 points whereas the Gauchos converted Irvine’s 19 turnovers into 31 points.</p>\n<p>On a three-game winning streak and tied with Cal Poly for third in the Big West, the Blue-Green rivalry this coming week will have high stakes for each team seeking to make a run in the standings as conference play nears its end.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/","id":946,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[945,944,943],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Edelman’s 3rd Straight Double Double Leads UCSB Past Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After losing to UC Riverside Thursday, the UCSB women's basketball team returned to form Saturday night, defeating Cal St. Fullerton 59-52.

The Gauchos forced Fullerton into turning the ball over on 19 occasions, and for much of the game, the Titans struggled against Santa Barbara’s defense.</p>\n<p>With the road win, UCSB moves to 9-13 overall and remains at 5th in the Big West at 6-5 in conference play. Redshirt senior Drew Edelman continues to play a huge role for the Gauchos, scoring 22 points and grabbing 11 boards against the Titans Saturday night. Edelman notched her third straight double-double in the victory and is averaging a dominant 23.33 points and 11 rebounds over the last three contests.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara held its single-game losing streak for roughly 48 hours, Fullerton was handed its seventh loss in a row. The Titans, at 7-16 overall and 2-8 in conference, are 8th place in Big West standings; however, they’re in a better position than last year when they finished 4-25 overall and just 1-15 in the Big West. Fortunately for Fullerton, the Titans will have a chance at redemption when they visit the Thunderdome Thursday of this week to take on Santa Barbara again.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB opened Saturday night’s game with a slow and steady first quarter in which Fullerton was held to only 7 points. While the Titans got on the board first with Daeja Smith layup, Edelman answered with a bucket of her own.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s bucket led to another for the 6’4 forward, then shots by Sarah Bates, Drea Toler, and Aliceah Hernandez fell for a 10-0 run over nearly 8 minutes. With 2:06 to go in the quarter, the Titans finally got a basket, a three, but Edelman again answered to make it 12-5 with 1:11 left.</p>\n<p>After two free throws by the Fullerton’s China Henderson put the Titans within 5, Sarah Bates sunk a three of her own to close out the quarter, UCSB leading 15-7. Shooting 2 of 13 and registering 8 turnovers in the quarter, the Titans had plenty to improve on heading into the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Using a 5-0 run to start the quarter, the Titans cut the Santa Barbara lead to 3 before the Gauchos got a bucket from none other than Edelman at the 6:47 mark.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s jumper sparked a 12-0 run by the Gauchos to take a 27-12 lead just under the five-minute mark. With 3:27 to go, Sarah Bates hit her second three of the quarter for the Gauchos’ last score of the half.</p>\n<p>Bates finished the game with 12 points and 5 rebounds to accompany Edelman in double figures for the third straight game. The Titans closed out the quarter behind a Hannah Thompson layup and Triann Thompson jumper, with both teams failing to score in the last 2 and a half minutes of the half.</p>\n<p>Edelman got the second half of play rolling with back to back baskets, giving the Gauchos their largest lead of the game, 36-18. Fullerton answered with an 11-2 run, forcing Santa Barbara to take a timeout at the 4:14 mark as their 18 point lead was diminished to 9.</p>\n<p>Following the timeout, Titan Jade Vega drained a three to make it 38-32, but a three by Hernandez and then Makala Roper with 7 seconds left allowed Santa Barbara to keep a 9-point lead, 47-38, heading into the final ten minutes of play. Hannah Thompson had 8 of her team-high 13 points in the third for Fullerton, while Edelman had 8 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter saw UCSB go through a scoring drought that lasted over half the quarter before Edelman got a layup to fall with only 4:21 to go. The Titans were busy during Santa Barbara’s dry stretch, putting together a 7-0 run.</p>\n<p>After Edelman’s basket, a Triann Thompson three-ball put the Titans within a single point, down only 49-48 with four minutes left. Roper got UCSB up 51-48 with a layup, but two more jumpers by Fullerton gave the Titans the 52-51 lead with 2:28 remaining, forcing a Gaucho timeout.</p>\n<p>Despite an amazing comeback by the Titans to take the lead, Fullerton failed to score following UCSB’s timeout. The Gauchos closed out the game using yet another Edelman bucket and enough made free throws to pull out the 59-52 victory.</p>\n<p>The exciting finish will make for an interesting rematch on Thursday when UCSB will host the Titans at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-11/edelmans-3rd-straight-double-double-leads-ucsb-past-fullerton/","id":945,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[944,943,942],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Come Up Short on the Road; Fall to UC Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"In Thursday night’s tightly-contested game against UC Riverside, the UCSB women's basketball team was outlasted by the Highlanders, in the end, losing 84-76.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In Thursday night’s tightly-contested game against UC Riverside, the UCSB women’s basketball team was outlasted by the Highlanders, in the end, losing 84-76.

Although Riverside tied the Gauchos for 23 points in the quarter, UCSB got hot early, making 6 of 10 three-point attempts, to provide answers in the back-and-forth quarter.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sarah Bates opened the game with a three of her own, followed by a three-point play from Edelman down low to put UCSB up 6-2. Bates then made another three to with 6:39 left to make it a 9-4 game, which seemed to wake up UC Riverside’s Michelle Curry. Curry scored 11 of her career-high 30 points in the first. Sarah Porter went 3-3 from beyond the arc for 9 of her 12 points on the night.</p>\n<p>Tied at 23 after one, the Gauchos didn’t fare quite as well in the second quarter as they did in the first. After shooting 50 percent from the field and 60 percent from three in the first, Santa Barbara shot just 28.6 percent overall and 20 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, Riverside shot 80 percent overall to outscore them 22-12 in the quarter. A tale of two quarters for UCSB, no Gaucho made more than one field goal as they were held scoreless in the last 3 minutes of the half.</p>\n<p>Curry added 6 points for the Highlanders, while Edelman rested the full 10 minutes. Down 35-45, head coach Bonnie Henrickson had the task of re-centering her team’s efforts during halftime, and it seems she did just that.</p>\n<p>Determined not to roll over so quickly, Santa Barbara gave the Highlanders a taste of their own medicine, outscoring Riverside 20-12 in the quarter to head into the fourth down by only 2. Opening the quarter on a 10-0 run, the Gauchos got big production from Edelman, who scored 10 points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also held Riverside to just 5 of 19 field goals, preventing any Highlander from making more than one shot. Drea Toler got a layup to fall at the end of the quarter to get UCSB back on track, down only 55-57.</p>\n<p>It seemed to be anyone’s game entering the final quarter of play, and it stayed that way until the end of the quarter. At the 2:47 mark, Edelman made another lay-in to tie the game at 73, but Riverside then went on an 11-3 run to close out the game 84-76.</p>\n<p>Edelman added 8 points in the quarter, but it wasn’t enough as Riverside used another 11 points from Curry to beat the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Despite a competitive effort from Santa Barbara, the Gauchos sent the Riverside to the line 22 times, where the Highlanders knocked down 16 free throws compared to Santa Barbara’s four.</p>\n<p>UCSB, plagued by turnovers in multiple games this season, kept possession of the ball fairly well, committing only 12 turnovers on the night while recording a season-high 25 assists.</p>\n<p>Sarah Bates joined Edelman and Porter in double figures with 12 points and 5 assists, her twelve games this season scoring in double figures.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have another chance at a victory Saturday when they visit struggling Cal St. Fullerton, which will tip off at 6:00 pm.</p><div

However, they then went on to win five in a row.</p>\n<p>UCSB has shown resilience and the ability to heat up, two very useful attributes as the second half of the season progresses. As per usual, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson is focusing on what’s to come and how to improve.</p>\n<p>In preparation for Thursday’s contest against Riverside, Henrickson stressed the unique nature of the Highlanders’ offense and how her team will defend it.</p>\n<p>“Riverside is a lot of five-out motion, cuts, slips, curls, guards posting. It’s a lot of difference. It’s a very different style than anyone else in the league, so it’s been trying to get comfortable with how we’re going to play it,” Henrickson said. “We need to minimize the number of catches in those spots by their players because it’s their motion and movement but players have tendencies. It’s a little bit of recognizing who am I guarding and what does my guy like to do.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Riverside’s offense has taken its toll on teams this season through exploiting mismatches.</p>\n<p>“They’re pretty balanced, so they bring some mismatch problems for us,” Henrickson said. “Their guards are going to post, which we don’t see a lot.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Henrickson, the Gauchos have plenty of options at the guard position and can continue to lean on their freshman point guard Sarah Bates as senior guard Drea Toler works toward returning to 100 percent.</p>\n<p>Bates leads Santa Barbara in scoring during conference play, averaging 14.6 points per game, but she’s not just finding the net. Also leading the Gauchos in the assist category, Bates has dished out an average of 3.1 dimes per game in conference matchups.</p>\n<p>Looking closer at Riverside, the Highlanders have fallen in their last four games, so they’re likely eager to get back on track. UCSB’s last meeting with Riverside was in last season’s Big West Quarterfinals, where the Gauchos won 81-71 to advance.</p>\n<p>Win or lose against Riverside, Santa Barbara will turn around to visit CSU Fullerton on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Similar to Riverside, the Titans are in a rut of their own, having lost five in a row. Despite Fullerton’s recent struggles, Henrickson again understands that records aren’t everything.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got good size inside,” Henrickson said. “Good shooters, good athletes. They’re much improved, playing with a lot of confidence. They’ve had big wins at home and been in one-possession games, so they’re much improved from last year.”</p>\n<p>Last season, the Titans went 1-15 in conference play and a dismal 4-25 overall, losing both games in their series against the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>With the potential to climb the rankings on the road, Santa Barbara is aiming to keep up its pace as well as defensive prowess.</p>\n<p>“I think for us, how aggressive we were in transition, we scored 23 points in transition which is a season-high for us,” Henrickson said, “I thought we had tremendous energy [against Hawaii] where we were able to take away some of their go-to looks, which is what we want to do against Riverside.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on UC Riverside tonight at SRC Arena at 7 p.m. UCSB and CSU Fullerton will play at 6 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 10, in Titan Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/gauchos-aim-to-keep-momentum-ahead-of-2-game-road-trip/","id":938,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[937,936,935],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Edelman’s Career Night Gets Gauchos Back on Track With Win Over Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos get rid of their two-game skid with a win over the Rianbow Wahine.

After opening Big West play 3-0, the Gauchos are fifth in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>While UCSB snapped its two-game losing streak on Saturday, Hawaii has now lost its last two games and lands it in last place of the Big West. Hawaii is now 9-14 overall and 2-8 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game with a much-improved shooting effort. The Gauchos were determined to get the ball inside to Edelman early, and they did just that.</p>\n<p>In the first quarter alone, Edelman had 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting. Hawaii’s offense seemed a bit disjointed in the first quarter of play, but a diversified scoring effort from five different players allowed the Rainbow Wahine to keep within a possession after one quarter of play.</p>\n<p>Up 19-16 to start the second quarter, UCSB kept its foot on the gas, opening with an 8-0 run. The run was led by none other than Edelman, who had 8 in the quarter, and Chaya Durr. After shooting 57.1 percent in the first, Santa Barbara went on to shoot an even better 60 percent in the second.</p>\n<p>But, the Gauchos weren’t only scoring efficiently, they held Hawaii scoreless for nearly five minutes as they constructed their run. Despite shooting 3-for-10 in the quarter, Hawaii used those three buckets to go on a 6-0 run in the last two minutes. The run placed Hawaii within a manageable 8-point deficit, but Edelman sunk two free throws at the end of the first half to go up 10 again, 34-24.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson spoke about her team’s performance in the second quarter, in which the Gauchos held Hawaii to only eight points.</p>\n<p>“I thought defensively, we were disruptive and forced turnovers and then scored off those turnovers,” she explained. “We were aggressive in passing lanes, we got on the floor for loose balls.”</p>\n<p>Consistency has been an issue for UCSB this season, but the Gauchos entered the third quarter with a sense of focus and determination to keep rolling.</p>\n<p>A barrage of three-pointers from Akilah Jennings, Sarah Bates, and Sarah Porter capped a 15-5 stretch for the Gauchos, going up 49-29 at the 5:07 mark. Down 20, the Rainbow Wahine, led by Sarah Toeaina, needed to make something happen.</p>\n<p>Toeaina got a pair of free throws to fall and shortly after made a layup in traffic for 4 points in 40 seconds to cap an 8-0 run, but the Gauchos stayed up 56-40 at the end of the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final quarter of play up 16, Santa Barbara looked to be in control, but the Gauchos’ shooting struggles resurfaced as they made only three field goals in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, Toeaina exploded for 13 points in the quarter as part of Hawaii’s continued comeback effort. From their 8-0 run to end the third, the Rainbow Wahine kept attacking in order to outscore the Gauchos 21-15 in the fourth. Toeaina, who struggled to get going early in the game, finished with 25 points.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Hawaii, its impressive comeback effort consisting of a 24-7 run was not enough, despite getting within 6. With only 30 seconds to go, Hawaii was forced to foul, sending Bates to the line. Bates, who finished with 13 points to accompany Edelman in double-digit scoring, confidently knocked down both. The Gauchos made all 8 of their final attempts from the charity stripe to close the game out 71-61.</p>\n<p>Behind Edelman’s 27 and 12 double-double, the Gauchos won the battle in the paint, outscoring the Rainbow Wahine 42-27 and outrebounded Hawaii 32-26.</p>\n<p>Guards Sarah Bates and Drea Toler finished with six assists each, but 21 turnovers by Santa Barbara marked a continuing issue for a team likely to be pressed by opponents.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to build off its win at UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton next week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/","id":898,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[897,896,895],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces Big West Best UC Davis, Hopes to Split Season Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FilePhoto-WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FilePhoto-WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After managing to get back on track with a win over LBSU, the UCSB women's basketball team prepares for its second attempt at an upset over conference juggernaut UC Davis.

The 6’4 forward shot 10-of-13 from the field and went a perfect 3-3 from the free-throw line, her fifth game this season being perfect from the line.</p>\n<p>As Edelman continues to control the paint with an average of 14.7 points per game and 9.2 rebounds per game, guard Sarah Bates has kept up her stellar performance, which is especially impressive for a freshman.</p>\n<p>Bates is Santa Barbara’s second-leading scorer behind Edelman with 10.6 PPG and is also the most efficient shooter from three-point range in the conference shooting 44.7 percent.</p>\n<p>In the win over LBSU, the freshman guard went 6-9 from behind the arc for her career high in three pointers made.</p>\n<p>Also second on the UCSB roster in minutes played with 27.1 minutes, Bates has been an impact player both during the regular season and in Big West play.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos hope to end UC Davis’ five-game winning streak, they’ll have to get better performances than their last meeting with the Aggies from the rest of their roster.</p>\n<p>In their first matchup played just one week ago, UC Davis visited the Thunderdome and came away with the victory in large part due to holding Edelman to only six field goals.</p>\n<p>Plaguing the Gauchos on that night was their shooting. Ending the game shooting 33.9 percent overall and 25 percent from three, UCSB will certainly aim to find the net more efficiently Saturday in Davis.</p>\n<p>Only losing by a close seven points, Santa Barbara has a feasible chance to redeem itself, but the Aggies have some weapons of their own.</p>\n<p>Averaging 19.4 points per game this season, redshirt junior Morgan Bertsch has been part of the Aggies’ success.</p>\n<p>Bertsch, a 6’4 forward, has led Davis in scoring in 15 games this season and produced a 16-point and 10-rebound double-double in the last meeting with the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Despite struggling at the beginning of the night against the Gauchos, Bertsch was a key cog in helping UC Davis seal the win scoring six points, collecting three rebounds and assisting on two baskets in the fourth quarter of the match.</p>\n<p>Also hurting the Gauchos in that game was Aggie Pele Gianotti, who scored 15 points despite missing all six of her three point attempts.</p>\n<p>Gianotti, a senior forward, is averaging 10.1 points per contest and leads her team in rebounding, averaging 5.8 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to make the necessary defensive adjustments against Davis in order to limit Gianotti’s and Bertsch’s production, but the Aggies will undoubtedly be ready to compete in the clash of the top-two Big West teams.</p>\n<p>Just one year ago, UCSB was the team that upset UC Davis in the Big West Tournament Semifinal.</p>\n<p>The Aggies have not forgotten that, and a regular season sweep of the Gauchos will be a good token of revenge. UCSB will take on UC Davis at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 27, at The Pavilion in Davis, CA.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Jan. 25</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily

thus far.</p>\n<p>In their two Big West losses this season, UCSB has lost by a combined two points with both games being away from home at Cal Poly and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>That being said, the Gauchos will hope to improve and make the tournament this year as opposed to last year, which saw them miss the Big West Tournament for the first time since 1998.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason for Santa Barbara’s turnaround has been the addition of graduate transfer forward Leland King II and the emergence of sophomore guard Max Heidegger.</p>\n<p>King II has helped the Gauchos on both ends of the floor, and he is a near shoe-in to win Big West Newcomer of the Year.</p>\n<p>He currently averages a double-double with 16.7 points per game, fourth-best mark in the conference and 10.2 rebounds per contest, the best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>However, the most shocking transformation has been that of Heidegger, who has completely transformed his game to become one of the most dangerous scorers in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The sophomore currently leads the league in points per game with 21.6 and is lethal from beyond-the-arc, shooting 44.4 percent.</p>\n<p>The team’s quick turnaround also has a lot to do with new Head Coach Joe Pasternack who, in his first season, has already broken the best start by a rookie coach in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>Overall, there is no doubt that the Gauchos are the biggest surprise in the Big West this season, but the key will be if they can continue this in Big West play.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on UCI at 9 p.m. this Saturday, Jan. 20, at the Thunderdome, where the Gauchos are still undefeated.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State 49ers by Sean White</strong></p>\n<p>It has been nearly six years since the Long Beach State men’s basketball program won its last Big West Tournament title. The 49ers were winners of the 2012 conference tournament — their last conference title — and nearly pulled off an upset over No. 1 seeded Hawaii in the 2016 Big West championship game before ending their season with an NIT first round loss.</p>\n<p>Since its NIT appearance, the Beach has seesawed between being in the middle of the pack to a potential top-tier team within the Big West.</p>\n<p>The NIT and near NCAA tournament appearances certainly influenced the 49ers’ decision to boost last season’s strength of schedule as they began their non-conference slate against elite programs such as Wichita State, North Carolina, Louisville, UCLA and Washington. Unfortunately, this got the best of them as they lost all five games straight, which then extended to nine games prior to their first win of the 2016-17 season.</p>\n<p>Now in the beginning stages of its 2017-18 Big West conference campaign, Long Beach State is currently in third place after a 84-75 loss to UC Davis on Wednesday, and are now 9-12 overall, 3-2 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite last season’s tough schedule backfiring, LBSU remained committed to challenging itself with games against premier non-conference opponents such as Arizona, Michigan State and West Virginia.</p>\n<p>Despite losing each game, senior forward Gabe Levin has been still managing to produce on the 49ers’ end. He leads LBSU in scoring and rebounds and is tied for the lead in steals with averages of 16.3 points, 7.2 rebounds per game and 22 steals. With just 8-of-30 three-pointers made on the season, it is evident that Levin is a dominant force for the 49ers in the paint and interior areas. Junior guard Bryan Alberts is the team’s second leading scorer at 14 PPG.</p>\n<p>LBSU will host Cal State Fullerton on Saturday, Jan. 20 at 7:30 p.m. and will be nationally televised by <em>FoxSportsWest</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly Mustangs by Andrew Hernandez</strong></p>\n<p>Junior point guard Donovan Fields carried the ball up the floor with less than a minute left in a Nov. 18 game at Santa Clara University in a pivotal moment in which his team needed a bucket to break the 59-59 tie.</p>\n<p>Fields’ 21 point effort was vital in keeping the Mustangs in the game all night, and it was the team looking at him again with just seconds on the clock.</p>\n<p>The junior answered the call and pulled up with 18 seconds left only to bury a jumper, giving the Mustangs the lead and the win.</p>\n<p>Much like that night against the Broncos, Fields has played a significant role for the Mustangs’ offense all season.</p>\n<p>The point guard leads the team in assists with 63, and his 13.2 points per game is good for second highest on the team this season.</p>\n<p>Senior Victor Joseph’s 13.8 points per game leads the team, and he is among one of the four players who have scored 100+ points so far this season, along with Fields, Jakub Niziol and Luke Meikle.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is off to yet another tough start. The Mustangs sit at 6-11 and 1-2 in Big West play. The team lost seven players from last year’s squad and despite filling a majority of those roster spots, the Mustangs still find themselves playing catch-up in this early part of the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is coming off an underwhelming December, in which the team lost five of its seven games and is hoping to bounce back.</p>\n<p>Thus far, January hasn’t been too friendly either.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have lost their last two consecutive conference games to CSUF and Hawaii following their conference-opener victory over UCSB that was decided at the free-throw line after a controversial foul call.</p>\n<p>Earning some wins is the next objective for the Mustangs, who went 6-10 in conference play last season.</p>\n<p>The Cal Poly Mustangs play at UC Irvine Thursday, Jan. 18 at 7 p.m. on <em>ESPN3</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge Matadors by Kendra Jackson</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge Matadors currently possess a 4-14 overall record and sit at 1-3 in conference play, and earned its most recent win with a 66-57 victory over UCR Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Matadors ended with an 11-19 overall record and stood at 7-9 within Big West conference play, which clinched the No. 6 seed for them in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Northridge is a balanced team as far as its roster, having nine underclassmen and eight upperclassmen. Their struggles have become apparent as their only wins have been sporadic and have only been achieved on their home court.</p>\n<p>In comparing the current season status of the Matadors to that of last season, the differences are evident. In the 2016-2017 season, CSUN was 7-7 at home, but managed to win some away games, with a 4-8 away record.</p>\n<p>Their biggest streak was a losing streak of six, which all came towards the winding down point of the season, with their last game being a loss versus the team that would eventually eliminate them from championship contention, CSUF.</p>\n<p>Northridge opened up their season in November with a win against Life Pacific, but shortly after endured a run of eight losses in non-conference play.</p>\n<p>The Matadors now stand as the eighth seed, sitting only in front of UC Riverside, who is 5-14 overall and 0-5 within the Big West. CSUN is due to host Cal Poly on Saturday, Jan. 20 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine Anteaters by Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Coming off of last year’s impressive 12-4 Big West record that earned it the bragging rights of being the Big West’s regular season conference champion, the UCI men’s basketball team will look to establish consistency and make a redeeming return to the Big West Tournament Finals. However, it had a tough non-conference slate, which has contibuted to its current overall record of 7-13, while thus far the Anteaters have split their Big West conference matchups by a record of 2-2.</p>\n<p>After coming up just short in its 50-47 loss to UC Davis in the Big West Tournament Finals, UC Irvine has been in reflection mode as it prepares for perhaps another championship run. Big West Coach of the Year, Russell Turner, will once again work with his junior forward Jonathan Galloway, who placed second in the conference in rebounds per game. They will try to inspire a fresh new team that consists of almost three-fourths underclassmen.</p>\n<p>Following their most recent 71-54 victory on the road against the CSUN Matadors, the Anteaters’ current .500 win percentage has them sitting exactly at mid table in the Big West Men’s Basketball standings.</p>\n<p>Although they have had their fair share of close games, an indicator of UC Irvine’s early struggles can be found in their scoring differentials. As of late, the Anteaters have averaged 70.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, their opponents have tallied an average of 71.1 points per game. UC Irvine has also averaged a total of 15.3 turnovers each game, a staggering amount compared to its 10.8 forced turnovers average.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host the UC Irvine men’s basketball team this Saturday, Jan. 20, at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii Rainbow Warriors by Brandon Victor</strong></p>\n<p>Just two years removed from upsetting Cal during the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Rainbow Warriors (12-5, 3-1) will look to improve upon last year, in which the team finished fifth in the Big West with an 8-8 conference record (14-16 overall).</p>\n<p>Despite being picked to once again finish fifth in the Big West and losing last season’s leading scorer in former star guard/forward Noah Allen, the Rainbow Warriors have implemented a balanced attack on the offensive end that has enabled them to average 73 points a game.</p>\n<p>“Our team strength is probably our balance,” Head Coach Eran Ganot said. “We have different guys who can step up and score for us on any given night. We play inside-out, play as a team and we share the ball really well.”</p>\n<p>While its 9-4 non-conf. start was encouraging, Hawaii was beating up on lesser competition. Against stronger opponents, the Rainbow Warriors have looked outmatched, losing by 13 to Nevada, 18 to Miami, 20 to Utah and 14 to Princeton.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we need to find consistency,” Ganot said.  “We’ve shown flashes, from a game-to-game basis and within games. I’m not sure if we’ve put together a complete game this year. We need to find an ability to find a consistent level.”</p>\n<p>Another potential concern heading into conference play is Hawaii’s lack of true road games. Hawaii split their first two conference games on the road, losing to Long Beach by eight before drubbing CSUN by 19.</p>\n<p>But Hawaii has always been dominant at home, and if it can even split their road games, the Rainbow Warriors are likely to finish near the top of the conference this season. Hawaii takes on UC Davis at home on Saturday, Jan. 20th at 9 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis Aggies by Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>Last season was a dream come true for the UC Davis men’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>After putting up a tremendous effort in the regular season, the team finished with a 23-13 overall mark and an 11-5 conference record. They then made program history, winning their first Big West Tournament title and an NCAA playoff match before having their historical run end against top-seeded Kansas.</p>\n<p>The player behind that historical run is Chima Moneke. He was a force to be reckoned with, averaging 14.6 points per game and 9.5 rebounds. Moneke earned Big West Newcomer of the Year honors as well as an All-Big West First Team nod.</p>\n<p>Moneke was the guy everyone was going to have their eye on, and it’s safe to say he has not disappointed.</p>\n<p>The senior forward has had an excellent season averaging 19.8 points and 10.1 rebounds per contest, both second-best marks in the Big West. He has been the biggest force in helping the Aggies reach an 11-6 overall mark and 2-1 conference record so far this season.</p>\n<p>Also, the brighter the stage, the bigger Moneke shines and stands out, allowing for his team to continue thriving and relying on their senior captain. In a game against Pac-12 opponent Washington State, Moneke finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds to lead UC Davis to the victory.</p>\n<p>Even with being picked to finish second in the conference by the media, there is no doubt that the Aggies will be tough to beat and will be on everyone’s mind come tournament time.</p>\n<p>UC Davis continues its run in Big West play against Hawaii on Saturday, Jan. 20.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside Highlanders by Andrew Bishop</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Riverside Highlanders entered their 2017-18 season hoping to bounce back from a disappointing 2016-17 campaign that culminated in a record of 7-21. The Highlanders had a hot start, going 3-0 during a brief tour in Quebec, and upsetting Pac-12 powerhouse UC Berkeley on the road.</p>\n<p>Despite early successes, the remainder of the Highlanders’ season has been nothing short of turbulent. The Highlanders entered conference play with a record of 5-9, and shortly after, parted ways with their head coach of 5 years, Dennis Cutts. They are now 5-13 overall and remain winless in conference play at 0-4.</p>\n<p>Cutts went 50-87 at the helm of UC Riverside’s men’s basketball team, and was succeeded by Associate Head Coach Justin Bell, who will serve as the team’s interim head coach until a replacement is hired. Bell, a UC Riverside alumnus, has struggled to lead his team to victory in all of their four conference games, putting the Highlanders at 0-4 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Throughout the season, the Highlanders have distributed their point production somewhat evenly amongst their starters. Sophomore guard Dikymbe Martin has emerged as the team’s leader in scoring, averaging 13.1 points per game. The Highlanders have also relied heavily on their veteran players on offense, with redshirt senior guard Chance Murray and senior forward Alex Larsson averaging 10.8 and 10.6 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>While the Highlanders have boasted solid performances from a few key players, it is clear that it will take more for them to be successful in the Big West. Bell and his players will look for their first conference win against UC Irvine next Wednesday, Jan. 24 at 7 p.m. on ESPN3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

season. Four games in, it looks like Santa Barbara is on the right track.</p>\n<p>Heading into conference play last season featured Santa Barbara sitting at 5-8; however, the Gauchos came alive in Big West play, going 9-7 and improving to 16-16 overall to close out the season at .500.</p>\n<p>UCSB went on to compete against Long Beach State in the Big West Championship, falling just short of the 49ers.</p>\n<p>While there have certainly been rough patches through Santa Barbara’s 2017-2018 campaign thus far, the Gauchos have demonstrated continual improvement. Improvement that, if continued, will perhaps carry Santa Barbara to another successful run in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I’m process-oriented, I’m not result oriented. If you focus on just a result, you’re not going to address the process element of the result. So for us, continuing to grow stretches where we play well and execute and we have the effort and the energy and the attention to detail it takes to be successful,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>“Then shrink the stretches of the opposite of that where we’ve not been disciplined, we’ve not been dialed in and not brought energy.”</p>\n<p>While turnovers remain a frustrating stat for UCSB, the Gauchos are finding ways to win. In their victory over New Mexico State, the Gauchos turned the ball over 22 times in spite of winning by 30 points. In the close win against rival Cal Poly, UCSB committed 33 turnovers. Santa Barbara’s averaging 17.8 turnovers per game this season, but 19.3 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite turnover woes, the Gauchos have been finding their rhythm offensively as they work the ball inside to redshirt senior Drew Edelman more effectively.</p>\n<p>Edelman is having an even better year than last season and that’s with her early battles with various injuries.</p>\n<p>The 6’4 forward is posting a statline of 14.3 points per game, which is almost four more points than she averaged last season, to go along with 9.4 boards.</p>\n<p>When simply looking at Santa Barbara’s results this season, it may be easy to dismiss the Gauchos in favor of Big West teams with better records.</p>\n<p>But, it is the constant adjustment as well as overall improvement that carries a team through a season, which Henrickson understands.</p>\n<p>“Good players and good teams find success and get better because they eliminate the things that don’t work and bad teams stay bad because they continue to do the things that don’t work,” said Henrickson. “[The Big West] is really good, young, fun and talented and exciting.”</p>\n<p>With momentum and anticipation of Big West competition, the Gauchos will certainly be put to the test as they seek to improve the process rather than simply the result.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Andrew Hernandez<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 2017-2018 season has not been kind to the 49ers of the Long Beach State women’s basketball team so far. The team’s overall record of 2-16 is a far cry from the 9-6 record the team had at the end of its non-conference schedule last season.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have had difficulty establishing a winning rhythm, and are winless at 0-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>The team had eight players, including four seniors, leave from last year’s squad but were able to fill the spots by bringing seven freshmen to the team. Among those freshmen were Ma’Qhi Berry, Shanaijah Davison and Emma Merriweather, who have done their best to make their impact on the team felt. Each player has scored 100+ points so far this season, but the team has still found themselves coming up short.</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ last win came on Dec. 7 in an exciting game that came down to the final minutes when senior Cecily Wilson put LBSU ahead by six with a layup. The 49ers were able to hold off GCU until time expired.</p>\n<p>Wilson is the only senior present within the team’s top four scorers and currently leads the 49ers in rebounds, averaging 6.6 a game. The veteran presence on the team has certainly taken a dive due to last year’s departures, but Wilson has shown that the team has the potential to do well given their significant amount of youth and guidance from the more experienced members of the team.</p>\n<p>“In order for us to be successful in conference play, we have to be more consistent on both ends off the floor. We have to stay disciplined and maintain our effort for 40 min,” Head Coach Jeff Cammon said. “To be specific, limit second chance opportunities by boxing out/rebounding on defensive end. Lastly, we have to take care of the ball and value possessions on [the] offensive end. This conference is tough, and we have to have a competitive mentality every night.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers will host UCSB Saturday, Jan. 20 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Following last season’s below average 7-9 record in Big West conference play, the Cal Poly women’s basketball team entered this year with something to prove.</p>\n<p>Now 8-7 overall, the Mustangs will try to find areas in which they can improve their game.</p>\n<p>They currently hold a conference record of 2-1 as the Big West competition unfurls.</p>\n<p>After ending third to last in the previous Big West regular season, Cal Poly’s Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh will want to return to major tournament play during her 21st season in the manager role and after four appearances in either the NCAA Tournament or WNIT since 2011.</p>\n<p>To help achieve this she’ll look to her most veteran players for help on reaching this team goal.</p>\n<p>Trying to improve upon last season’s seeding of No. 7 overall, Cal Poly has already started off on the right foot with their 2-1 record that places them in a tie for third overall in the Big West conference standings.</p>\n<p>Three Cal Poly players to keep an eye on as the regular season rolls on would be junior center Devin Stanback, senior forward Emily Anderson and senior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who are all statistical leaders in their own individual Big West categories.</p>\n<p>After coming off their most recent 84-71 win at home against the CSUN women’s basketball program, hopes are high for what this Cal Poly women’s basketball squad can truly accomplish.</p>\n<p>Made up of mostly returning upperclasswomen, spearheaded by Mimnaugh’s stellar coaching talents and a familiar game scheme aimed at success; this side expects at the very least a deep playoff run as it continues to progress into the 2017-18 campaign.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will host UC Davis this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – Sean White<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Fullerton’s 1-15 conference record last season was the third time in program history that it finished with just one win in conference play.</p>\n<p>CSUF’s 16-16 record in 2006-07 was its last time ending a season with an overall record of .500 or above, and its 8-7 conference finish was its last conference winning record.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, such results led to the hiring of Head Coach Jeff Harada. In his first year, he has already helped the Titans eclipse their conference win total of last season.</p>\n<p>Sitting at 7-10, 2-2 in the Big West, the Titans are tied for fourth place in the conference. With no Big West Tournament appearances in the last two years, the Titans’ time to rise may be near.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest thing I’ve learned this year has been patience. As a coach we are all very competitive by nature and want to win every game we play right away,” Harada said. “Understanding the history and state of our program, my goal is obviously to change that, but I have to remind myself that it’s not going to happen overnight. It truly is a process. Turning those small victories into bigger ones will hopefully take us where we want to be in the future.”</p>\n<p>Key factors within this process are junior guards Hannah Thompson and Jade Vega, who both rank in the top 10 of the Big West in scoring with averages of 12 PPG.</p>\n<p>Only time will tell if Fullerton can manage to put together a run that will secure a spot within the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Until then, we wait for March.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Brandon Victor<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Despite losing its first five games of the season, the Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team looks like it could possibly contend for the Big West title.</p>\n<p>CSUN (8-9, 1-2) recovered from its tough start by ripping off four straight wins, however, things have slightly declined considering the Matadors’ current two-game losing streak after defeating Cal State Fullerton in their first conference game of the season, 70-68.</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s recent slump, the presence of junior center Channon Fluker could possibly catapult the Matadors up the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Fluker, who was named the Big West Player of the Year last season, became the second player in Big West history to lead the conference in scoring, rebounding and blocks.</p>\n<p>In 17 games played this season, she has recorded eight double-doubles while averaging a conference leading 20.1 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>Fluker even recorded a triple-double during the team’s Dec. 30 game against Seattle, scoring 28 points and grabbing 16 rebounds, all while setting a conference record with 13 blocks en route to a 67-62 victory.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest strengths this season are our post play, depth and rebounding,” Head Coach Jason Flower said.</p>\n<p>The team will need to improve its late-game execution if it hopes to compete for the conference title this season. Other than a 48-point drubbing by Oregon to start the season, all of CSUN’s losses have been by single digits this season.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s next match is against Cal State Fullerton at  7p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18 at the Matadome.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Andrew Bishop<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Second-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue and her players entered the 2017-18 season with one goal in mind: to leave their 2016-17 season behind. Last year, the Anteaters went a paltry 5-26, with only three wins against conference opponents.</p>\n<p>“Last year I took over a team that was mainly senior-based,” Inoue said. “They did a good job, we just couldn’t finish games.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems Inoue faced going into this season was rebuilding a team that had recently lost a number of key seniors. “I had to replace a lot just because I was losing a lot,” she said. “A lot of the players from last year aren’t here this season, so it’s been a fresh start.”</p>\n<p>Irvine’s younger players have shared the bulk of the scoring throughout the majority of the season, with the help of sophomore guards Lauren Saiki (8.7 points per game) and Yazzy Sa’Dullah (7.7 points per game), and freshman forward Jordan Sanders (8.1 points per game).</p>\n<p>Irvine has also been supported in recent games by redshirt junior transfer guard Morgan Green, who made her Anteater debut on Jan. 4 against UC Davis. Green was sidelined throughout Irvine’s 2016-17 season, and the non-conference portion of its 2017-18 season due to NCAA transfer regulations.</p>\n<p>Despite suffering a loss to current conf. leader UC Davis in her first game as an Anteater, Green has lit up the scoreboard in her three appearances, averaging 22.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are coming off of a 77-74 win against UCSB which puts them at 2-1 in conference play. They will hope to add to their win total and continue their comeback season as they face Cal Poly this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Jorge Mercado<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 2017-18 season has been an odd one for the Hawaii women’s basketball team. After going 7-6 in non-conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were poised to make some noise come Big West play. Unfortunately for them, that has yet to be the case.</p>\n<p>Hawaii began conference play with three straight losses, with two on the road, but rebounded in their most recent effort in a home win against last place Long Beach State to have a 1-3 mark at this point in the conference season. They are currently in eighth place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Hawaii has some good talent. They currently possess the second-best shooting percentage in the conference at 40.8 and average 64.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Their leading scorer has been senior guard Sarah Toeaina, who was named to the Preseason All-Conference team by both the media and the coaches. She currently averages 14.1 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The only other player on the team averaging double figures is sophomore guard Julissa Tago, who is scoring 10.8 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The preseason poll had both coaches and the media expecting the Rainbow Wahine to finish in fourth place; however, with the struggles the team has going for them so far, there is no doubt there needs to be some work done before that prediction could become a reality.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing Hawaii has going for them, it is that they are currently 6-4 at home; however, now that Big West play is in full swing, they will need to shore up that defense on the road as well if they want to have some success.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s next match is against UCR on Thursday, Jan. 18, at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Spencer Ault<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis women’s basketball team entered the Big West Tournament with high hopes last season. UCSB brought those hopes crashing to the ground in the semifinals, defeating the Aggies 73-59 before falling to Long Beach State 56-55 in the finals.</p>\n<p>Disappointed as it was, UC Davis managed to bounce back in the WNIT. The Aggies advanced to the Sweet 16 after beating Utah and Colorado State, before falling to Washington State.</p>\n<p>Building off that postseason success, the Aggies are 13-3, and kicked off their season with ten straight wins.</p>\n<p>One of those wins came over Washington State in an impressive 91-76 victory that displayed how the Aggies have in fact improved from last year’s strong season. UCD’s success has continued in Big West play as well, as the team has gone 3-0 with victories over Irvine, Riverside and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior forward Morgan Bertsch has borne the bulk of the scoring load for UCD with 19.8 points per game. Bertsch was named to the first-team All-Big West last season, and is on pace to earn a repeat of the honor on this go around.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Pele Gianotti joined Bertsch on that team last season. Gianotti has been effective this season as well with around ten points per game and a team-high 5.9 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Rachel Nagel is next in line for scoring with 11.6 points per game, and has knocked down 42.6 percent of her three point attempts. That’s not the highest mark on the team, an honor that goes to senior guard Dani Nafekh, but it’s still a marksman-like percentage.</p>\n<p>UCD will have its first chance to redeem its semifinal upset loss when it takes on the Gauchos on Thursday, Jan. 18 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Kendra Jackson<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Riverside Highlanders are 5-13 overall and are currently 2-2 in Big West conference play. With a 3-4 record at home, the team has only managed to reign victorious away from the confines of the UCR Student Recreation Center once this season.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, when considering the team’s progress last season, the Highlanders ended as the fourth seed in the Big West tournament. With a 16-15 record overall and 9-7 in conference play, the initial first round matchup for UCR turned out to be the eighth seeded UC Irvine Anteaters.</p>\n<p>In terms of moving forward, UCR can still set its sights on a legitimate playoff run if it focuses on improving its record in conference play and dedicating itself to winning games not just at home, but also while on the road.</p>\n<p>With a playmaker like senior guard Michelle Curry running the show and redshirt sophomore forward Skyler Lewis collecting the boards, UCR definitely has the talent to right the ship.</p>\n<p>Curry averages 15.5 points per game, fourth best mark in the conference while Lewis averages 7.6 rebounds per game, also the fourth best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, the Highlanders are the sixth seed, but conference play has just begun and there is plenty of time to improve, especially since UCR is not too far behind Cal State Fullerton in the standings. If their conference play begins to excel, they can make a splash in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Coming off its most recent win against the CSUF at home in which senior guard Lauren Holt dropped 22 points, UCR is set to ride that momentum when it takes on Hawaii at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 18</em><em>, 2018</em><em>, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/","id":846,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[845,844,843],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/43"}},"__N_SSG":true}
