In my time here I’ve seen surf both mind-blowing and mundane, but unfortunately most of what I’ve seen around campus has always leaned towards the piddly mush. Perhaps that’s because my first fall quarter surfing Campus Point was so epic that it almost ruined my next two years surfing UCSB.</p>\n<p>Picture this: I’m a freshie, chillin’ in the Anacapa dorm. All of a sudden, I wake up in early December and guess what? It’s macking out there! So I charge it. I surfed the point until I was fatigued beyond exhausted and managed to bag my first Kelly Slater sighting. I had been surfing all day, the waves were probably head and a half, maybe double overhead, and just almost perfect. It was near dusk when I saw Slater and it was just me, Slater and another dude out in the water — way beyond the inside breakers, waiting for the outside set. After a short wait a big set comes in and Slater is in the deepest spot; but if I were him I would have never tried to take-off from where he was sitting—it was just a really heavy, slabby wave that was already closing out. But he’s Slater. And he charged it, throwing himself and his board over the lip, air-dropping maybe three or four feet, dropping down, down, down. Then he fell.</p>\n<p>That, my friends, was perhaps the only time I was legitimately scared out of the water anywhere near Santa Barbara. When Slater faceplants, I tend to get the impulse to get outta the water. That day in December (I think it was the 5th), that was the ultimate. It was the best, heaviest surf I’ve seen in Santa Barbara ever, and I’ve only seen waves like that here perhaps once more– that same year in February.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So you can imagine how stoked I was on my college experience when I came to school and was treated with a surf date with surfing’s biggest star amidst epic waves. I was ecstatic. Any surfer who asked me what I thought about SB surf, I’d have blown my load all over them in my excitement to tell them about my Slater sighting.</p>\n<p>You see, I grew up in Northern California where the water is sharky and the sand is cold black. Most days at my home beachbreak, people don’t sunbathe. They wear hiking boots, jeans and a coat to trek the beach. There are a few stellar weeks a year when the coarse, pebbly sand is bathed in sunlight and you’ll see more than a few swimsuits. The waves are good up north, but prone to get choppy and windy on the drop of a hat. Clean lines and gentle tubes are the things of dreamers up there.</p>\n<p>Here in Santa Barbara the waves are so tame for the majority of the year that you don’t face nearly as many dangers as you would surfing a more consistent, powerful piece of coastline. SB is not the best place for surf unless you know where you’re going and you are informed about tides, winds, swell movement, locals, gun-toting security and big fishies. Except when the occasional west swell shoots in past the goddamn Channel Islands and blesses us with some real surf, then you might just get to see some waves.</p>\n<p>But the surf kinda stopped coming in so strong after that first big swell my freshman year. It just slowed to a trickle, and hasn’t quite ever come back to full force, in my eyes.</p>\n<p>I’m hoping for the surf to build this year as global warming harshens — that’s what the scientists have been telling us:  good for surfers, bad for pretty much the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>If that doesn’t happen though, I’d encourage all newbie and hopeful surfers (‘groms’, per se) to grab a board and learn how to surf on these gentle little ‘SB nuggets —  I sure as hell won’t be getting in your way at Campus.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Surf Columnist Elliott Rosenfeld came to S.B. for three reasons: the surf, the women and school: in that order.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-25845\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-25845\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/","id":2299,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2298,2297,2296],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Honor the Sport of Kings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When I was asked to write a surf column for this issue, I immediately started fearing for my safety.

As Prof. Sweeney would tell you in his Geography of Surfing class, waves are a commodity: it’s all about scale.</p>\n<p>Most surfers know the blissful rush that accompanies a ride, the satisfaction of a big whack off the top, the feeling of being home in the strangely muted roar of a barrel. Best of all, a surfer knows the joy that comes with leaving the water after a good sesh as you strip off your wetsuit (unless you’re lucky enough to be in tropical waters), blow giant salty snot loads out your shnoz and take a moment to reflect on your waves, the water and the sun.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When your mind is in the right place, surfing provides exercise and spiritual orgasm at the same time. I can remember the best five barrels of my life. They also happen to rank among some of the best moments of my life.</p>\n<p>But it can be disappointing when you get to your feet on a decent wave and barely hint at pumping down the line—only to pull off the wave a moment later as some kook launches his polka-dotted 7’9″ hybrid twin fin straight at your dome with face-smashing, skin-splitting, tooth-knocking force. (“Oh sorry brah, was I in your way? Why were you going right? I totally thought Rincon was a left…”)</p>\n<p>So here’s my disclaimer: If you want to be a surfer, you’ve got to earn it. And that means doing your homework. Although it may look easy at times, surfing is no joke. The ocean is no joke. The animals in the ocean are no joke (I still have problems with the ‘S’ word). Big waves are no joke. Sharp fiberglass fins and pointed epoxy noses are no joke. Rip tides are no joke. Spitting barrels over dry coral reef are no joke. Necrotizing fasciitis (from coral infections) is no joke. If you want to be a surfer, you’ve got to act as a beginner of any craft or sport would: cautiously at first, and always respectful.</p>\n<p>Read Shaun Thompson’s <em>The Surfer’s Code</em>. He’s the world’s first professional surfer and he still shreds a stick better than you’ll ever be able to (locally to boot!). Memorize it. Pay attention to every rule, especially the following: “<em>I will never turn my back on the ocean.” </em>Surfers far better than you or me (R.I.P. Mark Foo, Malik Joyeux) have lost their lives to the ocean.</p>\n<p>It may take some time, but once you’ve found your footing on your board, come to understand the right of way rules in a crowd and learned to pick out the right times of day to go for a surf, you’ve probably also learned how to get your ass cussed out viciously by a local and how to avoid drowning as you simultaneously drink gallons of salt water through your nose and tumble around underwater like a Mexican jumping bean. Or at least you should have.</p>\n<p>If you are attempting to carry on surfing as a life passion, you are probably going to experience a shit-ton more dangerous, adrenaline-spiking situations in the water. And you’re probably also going to spend a gazillion hours a day fantasizing about warm water, moderate off-shore winds and empty lineups. Actually, you’re also going to spend thousands of dollars on surfboards, wetsuits, gas, plane tickets, hostels, taxis, hospitals, taco stands and surf videos in your quest for the ultimate ride, the perfect session, the hidden spot you’ve traveled the world to find.</p>\n<p>So all you wannabes, stop your itching to be able to say “gnarly” in casual conversation. The G bomb is reserved for those who have experienced the gnarly. Your day will come. Until then, I will just do my part to follow Thompson’s ninth rule: <em>I will pass on my stoke to a non-surfer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em> surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld is shocked by how many masturbation innuendos exist in surf slang.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-25287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-25287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/","id":2298,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2297,2296,2295],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Legislative Council meeting, members approved the Human Rights Board as an A.S. committee by a 20-1 vote. Following Arreola’s decision, the council, which can override a veto by a two-thirds vote, will address the matter at its meeting tonight.</p>\n<p>In his statement, Arreola called into question several of the bill’s elements, noting problems with its financial and organizational plans. The bill states that the new board will have a projected $0 fiscal impact for A.S. The HRB, however, calls for a Treasurer, Event Coordinator, Freshmen First-Year and Outreach Coordinator, as well as two Human Rights weeks per academic year, Arreola noted.</p>\n<p>“I do not see how any of these efforts will be possible without tapping into the Associated Students unallocated dollars,” Arreola wrote.</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President Chris Wendle, Arreola’s veto was a well thought-out decision.</p>\n<p>“I agree with his veto,” Wendle said. “…as the IVP looking at the structure of A.S., in my opinion there is evidence that shows that A.S. is expanding a little too fast… We need to appeal to what we have now; make our student government run a little more efficiently and understand exactly where our money is right now before we spend any more on new A.S. boards.”</p>\n<p>Arreola also listed other reasons for vetoing the HRB, including concerns about the vague nature of the group’s organizational structure, which calls for permanent directors from six non-A.S. groups and two A.S. groups. Another potential problem, Arreola wrote, is the HRB’s mission statement.</p>\n<p>“These set parameters allow for the proposed HRB to take stances on political issues, which we have seen Legislative Council struggle with in the past,” Arreola said. “By approving this bill, Legislative Council will be legitimizing a board that can potentially take a stance on political issues. This can potentially place the Associated Students in a compromising position by marginalizing the student body.”</p>\n<p>Nicolas Pascal, director of the UCSB Human Rights Council, said he was disappointed that Arreola did not share his concerns earlier.</p>\n<p>“I would have preferred that he would have worked with the Leg Council members who were working very seriously in the drafting of this bill,” Pascal said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/","id":3161,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[3160,3159,3158],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S. President Plans Veto","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students President Charlie Arreola is planning to veto the establishment of the Human Rights Council as an A.S. board.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students President Charlie Arreola is planning to veto the establishment of the Human Rights Council as an A.S. board.</p>\n<p>At last Wednesday’s A.S. Legislative Council meeting, members approved the instatement of the HRC as an A.S. entity by a 20-1 vote. Arreola is expected to release a statement tomorrow regarding his veto of the creation of the A.S. Human Rights Board.</p>\n<p>Under the A.S. legal code, the President has the power to veto legislation passed by the Legislative Council if he or she does so within two business days of its adoption. In addition, the president is required to release a statement explaining the reasons for the veto within three business days of the legislation’s passage.</p>\n<p>Arreola did not return calls for comment as of press time.</p>\n<p>According to HRC Director Nicolas Pascal, Arreola’s decision to veto the bill surprised him.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been speaking with many member of the Human Rights Council, all of whom have expressed confusion and disappointment in Charlie Arreola’s seemingly bizarre decision,” Pascal said. “We haven’t yet received even one justification for his veto of an incredibly popular initiative that was passed with only one dissenting vote.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Chris Wendle, meanwhile, said he did not know the reasoning behind Arreola’s veto.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really know anything about it,” Wendle said. “I would really just wait for Charlie’s release because I don’t really know much about his decision.”</p>\n<p>As per the legal code, any legislation vetoed by the president will be automatically placed on the next week’s Legislative Council agenda. The council can override the veto by a two-thirds vote.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Jasmine Davenport, who authored the HRC bill, said the council has not yet taken a stance in response to the veto.</p>\n<p>“The Legislative Council is not really sure right now where we stand,” Davenport said. “Obviously I don’t agree with it because I was the author of the bill. I am willing to work with him and other leadership of A.S. to better the bill and better the board.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/","id":3128,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[3127,3126,3125],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/220"}},"__N_SSG":true}
