A spokesperson for the UC Office of the President said in an email that Napolitano will consider the recommendations “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as we continue to work with our campuses and community members to find ways to ensure public safety and best serve the entire University community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the letter to Napolitano, Kum-Kum Bhavnani, chair of the council, said the recommendations “represent our solidarity with the current protests against racialized police violence.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The University must respond to this watershed historical moment by reassessing the role and presence of police on campuses,” Bhavnani said in the letter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Academic Council centered the recommendations on statements they received from students and faculty across the UC System about anti-Black police violence. While the recommendations expand on work done by the Academic Senate’s Public Safety Task Force and the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing, they also criticize the groups’ recent reports as “narrow-bore and technocratic reforms that have failed to address the underlying roots of racialized policing.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recommendations echo </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/polling-defund-the-police.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calls around the country for communities to defund their police</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> departments and redirect the funding to community services, especially those that benefit Black communities and communities of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Academic Council recommended that the UC: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“substantially” defund campus police departments and move the funding toward efforts to develop “alternative modes of campus safety that minimize and/or abolish the reliance on policing and other criminalizing responses” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in mental and physical health services, especially for Black students and other marginalized students “who have been historically targeted by police violence” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove firearms from campus police’s standard equipment </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terminate partnerships with police agencies outside of the UC and restrict access of non-UC police to campus property </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implement the recommendations over three years through campus and UC-wide groups which “prioritize the participation of those who have traditionally experienced violence and mistreatment at the hands of police” </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bhavnani said the recommendations “offer a guide for rethinking the role of police on UC campuses” and could spark needed conversations between university officials. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/upcoming-year-will-be-uc-president-napolitanos-last-in-office/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano will step down</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from her position as president on Aug. 1.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judges of the 2019 UC Los Angeles Bollywood Fusion dance competition Jhoomti Shaam were about to announce the winners of that year’s competition. But the women of UCSB Taara — a dance team performing South Asian dance styles — had already decided they wouldn’t place at the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were so many amazing teams and we had accepted it. We were like, ‘You know what, we’re going to get last. And that’s okay,’” Natasha Nema, one of the group’s four founding members, said. “We were genuinely fine with getting last because we just couldn’t even believe that we were there in the first place against that many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group had been together for less than a year, and after scoping out the competition, they thought they didn’t stand a chance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really weren’t even listening, cause we were like, ‘Oh, we don’t really care. Like, yeah, we’ll listen for second and first, sure. But third place, we don’t really care,” Nema recalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the judges announced the winners –– they placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t even comprehend that our name was being spoken, that we just paused for a little bit. And then we screamed, it was like two seconds later,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In less than a year since the group’s inception in June 2018, the four hopeful members became a winning team of 12 in their dream competition. That was in March 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One year later, in February 2020, UCSB Taara took first place at Bollywood Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This June, the four original members of UCSB Taara –– Nema, Shivani Shah, Sejal Chandra and Jashanna Walia –– graduated from UCSB and said goodbye to the group they envisioned, nurtured and led to victory over two years. For those four women, leaving Taara “Gen One,” or what they call the first generation of UCSB Taara dancers, meant leaving a lasting legacy at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To have our literal legacy on this campus and a part of us still at UCSB forever, I think, to me at least, is really, really special. It’s like a home you’ll always have when you visit campus and a bond you’ll always be a part of, no matter how old you get,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia recently passed the baton to a new generation of dancers, but they expect to watch the group progress for years to come. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t even imagine being old enough to see Taara Gen 10 … It’s changed so much in just two years that I can’t even imagine what it’s going to be like in another two years,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning in the summer of 2018, the girls buckled down in brand building and recruiting efforts. They decided on their official name –– Taara, which means star in Hindi –– designed a logo, ordered team jerseys and hired a DJ to create a dance mix for their group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema handled the marketing side, which meant legitimizing the team, recruiting new members and defining their style. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really wanted for people to take us seriously within the circuit because there were already so many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before creating Taara, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia were all in other Bollywood or Bhangra dance groups at UCSB but had frustrations with the groups’ leadership. So the four decided to create their own group: a competitive, all-female team that fused the styles of Bollywood, Bhangra, hip-hop and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But starting a new group meant that Taara didn’t have a proven reputation to help recruit dancers. New members would have to take a leap of faith, and the original four had to convince recruits  that Taara could go the distance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How do we get all these new people to trust us? How do we get these people to commit 20 hours a week, at least, of dancing, to get them to the next place where we can compete and where we can prove ourselves?” Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema took to social media, scouring Facebook pages for incoming freshmen and potential recruits, and even went as far as downloading dating apps. Some of the others made friends with dancers already in the competition circuit, Desi Dance Network, to learn insider tips. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At tryouts later that year, Taara accepted 12 new members, bringing the team to 18. But that number was quick to dwindle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Literally just two days later, girls would start dropping out” due to the time commitments,  Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time their first competition came around, their group was down to a solid 13 members, just one member more than the minimum required to compete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That year, UCSB Taara competed in back-to-back competitions for three straight weekends. After the first competition, one teammate dropped out on the drive back to UCSB. Now, they were down to 12, and the team had to rearrange dance formations for the next two weekends of competition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founders said that competition season was grueling for the team. Between balancing school schedules with dance practice, the four struggled to keep the team motivated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone’s grades are falling, no one is sleeping, everyone’s sick, you’re just practicing in parking lots,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taara didn’t have its own designated space to practice on campus, so the captains had to get creative in finding a space to dance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would squeeze ourselves into tiny rooms,” Shah said. “We snuck into the theater building. We snuck into [the Humanities and Social Sciences Building]. We snuck into Rob Gym. We snuck into so many [buildings], just so that we could have some floor to dance on.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the next weekend’s competition, Taara placed eighth –– last place. The girls used the week between that competition and their next to rearrange parts of their performance with feedback from the judges. At the last competition that season –– Jhoomti Shaam –– Taara placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Winning that, not only was it just amazing because it was our dream competition, but I think it finally showed the team that everything we did was for a reason,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team knew at that moment, claiming their trophy, that the tireless hours of practice, sleepless nights and long drives to competitions had paid off. For a team that wasn’t expecting to place at all, taking home third place was more than a victory — it was proof that Taara lived up to its name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a new generation of Taara prepares to take the reign, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia agree that Gen One created a precedent –– and a bond –– that will live on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Gen One, especially, everyone just grew so close and over everything, it was just a family. I think even leaving it, I know that everyone’s still going to be a team forever, as cheesy as it sounds,” Walia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was no accident that Taara Gen One became a family since it was one of the group’s first goals when they set out to create Taara. They wanted to compete and impress, but mostly, they wanted to dance with people they loved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were 12 small girls, but we were the loudest girls in every room and we were just having the best time. And I think that like, like positive energy really just attracted others to us,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taara isn’t just a dance team. We’re also people, we’re good people. We want people to know that we’re friendly people and that is part of why we dance. It makes us happy. We want to share that happiness.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

So a little less traditional archiving for community archives,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Force is working with Matt Stahl, the university archivist, on the COVID-19 archives project. Stahl said archives focus traditionally on documents like administrative records; while Stahl and Force plan to collect UCSB announcements and official documents related to the coronavirus pandemic, the focus for this project is to provide a community perspective of life during the coronavirus pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The all-digital aspect of the project adds a greater degree of access for the UCSB community, many of whom are scattered across the country, to safely participate in the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through a google form on the </span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/ucsb-covid-19-community-archives-project-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University Library</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> website, interested participants can answer questions about their coronavirus stories –– where they are waiting out the pandemic, how they have been impacted and how the pandemic has changed their perspective on life — all while remaining anonymous.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions could be anything from YouTube videos about a day in the life during the coronavirus pandemic to photographs of an empty UCSB campus to personal blogs, but the possibilities for submissions are limitless, Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows for a safe place for self-expression and catharsis,” Force said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for Force, the role of documenting UCSB history during the coronavirus pandemic goes beyond simply archiving — preserving the experiences of individuals during the pandemic is an essential piece to recovering and surviving it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re kind of acting as cultural heritage first responders. We’re responding to moments of tragedy and crisis in a different way than the frontline medical professionals do,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re offering a way to preserve people’s stories and truths, not only for evidentiary value but for self edification to capture historical moments at its most raw and unfiltered form.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl pointed to other examples of when UCSB archive projects were used as a response to community crises, like the</span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/special-collections/isla-vista-memorial-project\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Isla Vista Memorial Project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The COVID-19 archives project parallels the memorial project because both projects ask fundamental questions of “how are people dealing with trauma,” and “how does the UCSB community deal with trauma,” Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 archives project has been accepting submissions through its website since May 14, but there is no set deadline for the closure of submissions. Force said that the move to a digital platform will make keeping up with submissions more difficult, as technology advances quickly and the project team will have to stay up to date with making the archives “safe and accessible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions are limited to UCSB-affiliated participants and will be curated through a “quality control process,” Stahl said, but noted that this process is only to filter out non-serious submissions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that Force and Stahl are in the collecting phase of the project, the next step will be organizing the incoming submissions and data from participants, known as “post-capture work.” Here, Stahl and Force will work to preserve the files and find a place to store them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond preserving the everyday stories of the coronavirus pandemic, Force hopes that this project will open the community to the University Library’s archive work and encourage future collaborations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are places that want to tell their stories, that want to collect their history, that your individual experience matters,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Telling that story as accurately as possible and creating that safe space and kind of forging those bonds is critical to the human experience.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Some noted that they had not originally planned to speak but became convinced to after seeing others do the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many speakers urged for allyship from non-Black communities and emphasized the need for people in a position of privilege to self-educate about the Black community’s struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black people are everywhere and deserve to feel safe everywhere,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers expressed discontent with the Black student experience at UCSB, noting a lack of resources and a small population of Black students, </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently at 5%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the undergraduate student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walk in I.V. and see what it feels like to have everybody staring at you for no damn reason,” one speaker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers shared personal accounts of police violence and fears that their Black loved ones could wrongly face violence or death at the hands of law enforcement. One speaker recounted a conversation with her younger sister in which her sister said she was afraid to go for a walk, or for her father to leave the house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I tried to tell her that she is safe, but I know in the back of my mind that that was not true. Even if she does everything right, even if she gives them no cause to bother her, there is a chance that she might become the victim of police brutality in this country just because of who she is,” the speaker said. </span></p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-94721-2-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94743\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94744\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94768\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94747\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94742\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94741\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94746\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94745\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94748\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94766\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethan Bertrand, a member of the I.V. Community Services District Board of Directors, recalled a conversation he had with his own father before his father visited I.V. for graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to say, ‘Dad, you’re an older black man walking around our community and some people may see you as a threat. Some people may not think that you belong here, which you do, but some people don’t understand that, so please be careful,’” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so hard for us to find the strength to battle through our tears to say that once again, we’re going to stand together and stand up,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers also stressed the need for Black voices to be heard and acknowledged by non-Black communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pay attention to Black voices. Stop trying to speak over us. Stop trying to tell us what the answer is,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several UCSB administrators were in attendance at the demonstration, including Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life; Aaron Jones, director of the Educational Opportunity Program; and Diana Collins Puente, director of community affairs, student development and leadership at UCSB’s Associated Students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s absence and lack of communication prior to the start of the march was widely criticized by participants. About halfway through the speeches, Yang sent out a mass email to the student body that addressed Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for those affected by his death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His words mean very little to me at this point,” one speaker said after reading aloud Yang’s statement to the crowd.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 1:30 p.m., protestors marched through I.V. chanting and holding homemade signs, as employees at local businesses observed from behind windows or stood outdoors to cheer on protestors. Once it reached Del Playa Drive, the crowd drew Isla Vistans out onto their balconies and into their yards. Some observers held their own signs and clapped for protestors, while others silently stared as the crowd marched toward Sands Beach, gathering more marchers along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surfers on bikes and families with children stood off to the side while protestors made their way down the dirt trail to Sands Beach, eventually gathering in a circle in a small field, where the demonstration’s organizers thanked the crowd for its solidarity and called for 30 seconds of silence to remember Floyd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those 30 seconds, protesters held their fists high in the air, some closing their eyes, the sound of the breaking waves the only noise.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

I.V. is divided into three census tracts, which are subdivisions in each county used in the counting process; I.V.’s three tracts divide the unincorporated district into strips perpendicular to the ocean. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista has been designated a hard-to-count community. This was before the pandemic,” Spencer Brandt, president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said I.V.’s young population already made gathering census responses in the community challenging. With the pandemic forcing social distancing regulations and</span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the retreat of Santa Barbara Community College and UC Santa Barbara students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, educating  I.V. residents and conducting typical census outreach has been complicated. If response rates remain low, the community risks losing crucial funding, Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether or not people are counted in our community will affect a ton of different government and education-related programs for funding and how much funding Isla Vista and the UCSB area receives,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of the census affect a decade’s worth of congressional representation and federal funding in communities, which could go toward projects ranging from infrastructure and highways to school lunches and special education, according to the </span><a href=\"https://2020census.gov/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Census website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normal deadlines and operations in the census project have been extended due to complications from the coronavirus pandemic, and the I.V. CSD is looking for volunteers to start calling households as part of the next phase of the census tracking, according to the I.V. CSD website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a similar point in the 2010 U.S. Census, I.V.’s response rate was about 60%, according to the I.V. CSD website. None of the three census tracts in Isla Vista have reached 50% as of May 26, and</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“undercount of this magnitude would severely negatively impact Isla Vista’s funding until the year 2030,” according to the I.V. CSD website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”We’re gonna employ every effort that we possibly can to try to get the word out to people,” Brandt said. “The biggest thing that residents can do if they’re concerned about the population is … spread the word to still get counted in Isla Vista [and] don’t get counted at your parents house.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite students’ return to their hometowns, the U.S. Census Bureau said students should respond as if they were at their normal place of residence in I.V. Students normally living in on-campus housing are automatically counted in the census through the university. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

And I don’t care if someone gets mad at me or I’m just going to bring up these issues that I’m passionate about or that my constituents are telling me to,” he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas began his career in campus politics as a senator in the 2018-2019 school year. Now, he’s finishing out his term as External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and preparing to pass on the baton to his successor, third-year political science major Yasamin Salari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over his year-long term, Ornelas said he learned to adopt a more restrained attitude and balanced approach to serving the study body. He said some of the best advice he received during his term was from Katya Armistead, UC Santa Barbara’s dean of student life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She told me ‘You’re going to have to learn how to choose your battles and if it’s something that you really want to go into, then give it your all and don’t look back,’” Ornelas said. “That’s not anything I was thinking about last year. Like last year I was just like, I’m going to call out anyone and see what happens.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides his original platform goals — which included creating a monthly farmer’s market in Isla Vista, hosting special-topic classes co-taught by professors and students and solving mold issues in housing — Ornelas’ position as EVPLA required his participation in frequent student and administration discussions across campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these discussions included higher-ups from the UC Police Department (UCPD) or UCSB administration, like Chancellor Henry T. Yang, and gave him a look into important conversations happening around campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was privileged to just [have] these really unique situations that students would never be able to be in the room for. I was the student that was allowed into the room. So acknowledging that privilege but also struggling sometimes with kind of feelings of imposter syndrome and stuff like that was really interesting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said he dealt with self-doubt in some of these discussions and teetered between feeling the need to speak out and not knowing when to step in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve had moments where I was like, ‘Okay, you need to be in this room, you need to say something,’ but also struggling with like, ‘Okay, why am I in this room? Am I qualified to be in this room?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said the pressure to please everyone was much greater in an executive position than as a senator. Over the past year, he said the balance between mollifying the university, serving his constituency and accomplishing his platform points proved difficult. In the end, he was not able to accomplish all of his platform points, including the co-taught classes, but he pointed to a few moments in his term that exemplified his commitment to serving students’ needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those includes the district supervisor </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/3rd-district-supervisor-candidates-field-community-questions-at-isla-vista-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall in February, </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">organized by Ornelas’ office, that featured two of three candidates running to be the Third District Supervisor for Santa Barbara County, a seat currently held by Joan Hartmann. Ornelas said the event was important for I.V. residents to hear from the candidates, since “the supervisors literally determine so much for us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But he acknowledged the drama regarding the absence of one candidate, Bruce Porter, at the meeting. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter initially planned to attend the meeting, but after some confusion surrounding the date of the town hall, Porter said he would not be attending and asked Ornelas’ office to reschedule the event. Ornelas responded to Porter saying that while his office would not be rescheduling the event, it was “very open to hosting another town hall event.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was kind of one of those moments like, ‘Okay, we need to remain nonpartisan and just like not politicize this.’ And so our response was pretty much like, ‘We’re sorry [that] you can’t be here,’” Ornelas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornerlas also had success in organizing open markets in I.V. that brought music, vendors and services to Little Acorn Park once a quarter. He originally planned to bring downtown Santa Barbara’s farmers markets to I.V. to provide the same access to fresh produce, but decided that the potential collaboration would place too many restrictions on I.V.’s open market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EVPLA office instead sponsored the I.V. Open Markets, which had been operating independently since before he took office. The office’s sponsorship relieved the financial burden for vendors who participated in the market by covering deposits and paying for the park rental. His office also helped to organize the logistical elements, like waste and water services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said he was especially proud of the expansion of the market over his term, which included bringing multiple bands — such as Art Official and Careless Club — and increasing the number of participating vendors and attendees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a lot of planning that went into that and we had like thousands of people and like the most vendors we’d ever had and everyone liked the music,” Ornelas said. “That was kind of just a passion project that was really rewarding.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One project he said has been his most impactful — and one that Ornelas hopes Salari will continue to develop — are the relationships he said he has fostered between the UCPD and the EVPLA office, which took shape in the development of the police collaborative board and other working groups. Ornelas’ predecessor, Jeike Meijer, helped to </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-17/police-collaborative-board-breaks-ground-with-first-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launch the program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> toward the end of her term in 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Ornelas planned to use the board to address community members’ concerns about the allegations </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-26/sixth-ucpd-lawsuit-filed-against-department-alleging-sexual-harassment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made in several lawsuits against UCPD,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but the task proved more tedious and complicated than planned. Ornelas said his office had planned a community forum to facilitate discussion about the lawsuits, but after the coronavirus pandemic cancelled in-person classes at UCSB, the possibility for a forum thinned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, Ornelas said his relationships, in particular with Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder and UCPD officer Ariel Bournes, produced benefits for the community in other ways, like discussions about safety for major events like Halloween and Deltopia, the promotion of </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the party registration program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the UCPD instagram account created by Bournes, who contacted Ornelas for advice about creating the profile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the coronavirus pandemic threw a wrench in many plans for this spring quarter, Ornelas said that as students’ needs shifted under the new circumstances, his office was able to meet those needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for his successor, Salari, Ornelas said he hopes that she will be able to carry on the work that his office has put in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did a lot of the groundwork for the next EVPLA and a lot of it was already here for me too, so I’m hopeful that when Yasamin comes in, she can see the work that we had done and kind of start her term up with that,” Ornelas said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the next EVPLA’s term still involves some uncertainty as to how the duties will be carried out during a world pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re looking at the possibility of a remote fall [quarter], what does that look like for the next EVPLA?” he asked. “I’m not exactly sure.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The bus was subsequently towed following his arrest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is currently in custody at the Santa Barbara County Jail and is being held on $200,000 bail, according to SBSO. According to Santa Barbara County Jail custody logs, Coughlin works for Grubhub, an online food delivery service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBSO detectives conducted interviews with witnesses and administered “a behavioral threat assessment” of Coughlin, after SBSO “received various reports regarding Coughlin,” according to Zick. The detectives also searched through his social media accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Coughlin] caught the attention of locals with his references on social media to the tragic mass murder that occurred in Isla Vista in 2014.

The university, however, has yet to make an official decision about the status of fall quarter instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think it’s out of the question,” Ali Javanbakht, interim Student Health service executive director and medical director, said in an interview. He’s been participating in almost-daily phone calls led by Chancellor Henry T. Yang, in which leaders from UCSB groups give updates and discuss the future of in-person instruction at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the general consensus is it’s not gonna be 100% in-person again. I don’t think anybody thinks that would be wise,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I don’t think that anybody thinks that having a completely remote fall quarter would be reasonable either. Most people are feeling like it would have to be some kind of in-between,” he added. “Some kind of hybrid.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea behind a hybrid-instruction quarter is to disrupt the transmission of coronavirus by reducing the opportunity for it to spread from person-to-person in close-contact environments like classrooms. Campbell Hall’s 900-person lectures and sections with students sitting desk-to-desk could be a thing of the past, at least for now, Javanbahkt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang’s COVID-19 Response Working Group, which includes leaders from all corners of the campus from Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises to the Academic Senate, is discussing ideas for new course structures and campus practices such as having in-person classes with smaller groups, face mask distribution to all students and faculty and single rooms for students living on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The steps need to be in place to limit how many times [and] how often different students congregate,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For hybrid classes, this could mean placing students in alternating groups for each course that switch between in-person instruction one day and remote instruction the next day, so that if a person in one class group gets sick, the virus would have less opportunity to spread to more people, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of face masks could also become a widespread practice on campus, as the working group is considering making them available to everyone who uses campus facilities. Implementing widespread use of face masks entails creating “the culture and the awareness” to encourage young people and students to use them, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For housing, UCSB is considering allowing only singles or doubles in its campus dorms and residence halls. However, there’s concern among the working group that there aren’t enough rooms available for this change, a problem that could potentially “push more people into Isla Vista, a place that we don’t have control over,” and where the spread of the virus could go unchecked, Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said I.V.’s unique population of UCSB students, Santa Barbara City College students, working adults and families means the path to testing must be pursued collaboratively by both the university and the county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The university] can certainly offer services and testing and give them to UCSB students in Isla Vista but that’s about half the Isla Vista population,” Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most scientists agree that the path to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">normal life starts with widespread community testing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but Santa Barbara County’s testing capacity has not extended beyond those who display symptoms or are at a high risk. Three new community </span><a href=\"https://publichealthsbc.org/testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">testing sites opened up in the county on May 5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Santa Maria, Lompoc and Santa Barbara. Everyone is eligible for testing, but essential workers, members of the high-risk population and those exhibiting symptoms are being prioritized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county confirmed Isla Vista’s first case of coronavirus on March 30. Five weeks later, it remains I.V.’s only confirmed case. While other communities in the county have seen a rising  number of cases, I.V.’s count has been stagnant for over a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of May 7, UCSB Student Health has administered 103 coronavirus tests; 102 tested negative and one was still pending at the time, according to Javanbakht. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UCSB Student Health has had to be “judicious” with its testing, Javanbakht said, since coronavirus tests are expensive — $60 per person — and in high demand and low supply. But testing needs to be expanded in order to get a sense of what the coronavirus spread looks like in the community, and as of now, Student Health services “is not set up to do that,” Javanbakht added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re talking about broad big scale testing … to pave a path forward to resuming operations, that’s a very different scale,” Javanbakht said. “[We] don’t have the resources to do that. That’s more of a campus-wide level of operation that would need to happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic has administered 14 coronavirus tests in I.V. as of May 7, but none have come back positive, according to Charles Fenzi, the chief executive officer and chief medical officer at the clinic. The clinic normally serves around 5,000 people, a number that usually goes down in the summer when students flock back to their hometowns, Fenzi said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible that I.V. is not seeing dramatic increases in coronavirus cases due to students returning home amid the move to online instruction, according to Fenzi. When students return, however, he said that the campus will likely need to look much different than normal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s gonna be a real push if we allow people back on campus to [return] in a way that is safe for everybody so the social distancing thing is going to be a fact of life for a long time,” Fenzi said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said overcrowding of residents in I.V. is a complicating factor in slowing the spread of coronavirus and one that will make the university’s decision on housing more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt is working with I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud and the county on a reopening planning group to draft guidelines and practices for the reopening of the economy and the education sectors in I.V., including Isla Vista Elementary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the county’s goal is to increase testing, Brandt said “it’s a slow process.” </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/05/01/santa-barbara-county-begins-community-testing-for-covid-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three new testing sites</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have brought the county up to about 200 tests per day since they opened, Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said he believes “many people in Isla Vista have been infected with COVID-19 but we either did not have the test at the time or they were just not prioritized for the testing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While communities across </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-08/these-are-the-california-businesses-that-can-reopen-and-these-are-the-rules\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California begin tiptoeing into the reopening process</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the picture of the coronavirus spread in I.V. remains murky. Javanbakht said the single case of coronavirus confirmed in I.V. since March 30 could mean “we just don’t have that many [cases] on campus or in Isla Vista” or “that we just haven’t tested the right people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the reality of the coronavirus spread in I.V. could have huge implications in the future for Isla Vistans and UCSB students, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you take a community and you test them and the positive rates are really low, is it because COVID hasn’t come there at all? Or is it because it came and spread and it went,” Javanbakht said, “and those are very different dynamics.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

president.</p></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the first time, both the Associated Students (A.S.) election campaigning and results night took place remotely as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\">shift to remote instruction</a>. The results night event was held this year over Zoom, a drastic shift from the traditionally high-energy, high-emotion atmosphere in the Hub in the University Center. Around 350 people tuned in tonight for the elections Zoom call, according to Davis Quan, A.S. Elections Board chair.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Campus United maintained its majority hold in the A.S. Senate for the fifth year in a row, claiming more than half of the seats, 14 out of this year’s 25.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The full list of senator-elects can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-04-23/live-a-s-spring-quarter-election-results-2020/\">here.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">President-elect Daevionne Beasley, who ran with Campus United, claimed his second executive position after first serving as the university’s External Vice President for Statewide Affairs during the 2019-20 school year. Beasley’s opponents in the presidential race, Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who ran with the Isla Vista Party, and Austin Foreman, who ran as an independent, trailed behind with 39.0% and 10.1% of the vote, respectively.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beasley said in an interview after the results night that he is excited about his win, but regretted that the circumstances of the digital spring quarter have forced the emotional and intimate tradition of election night to be held through screens and moderated remotely — cheering, hugs and tears have been replaced by digital reactions and instant messaging.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“It’s like a really crazy feeling because [there is] a global pandemic, and I just won the presidential election, so I’m just feeling very bittersweet,” Beasley said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m very glad I got the win, but my fellow students aren’t able to feel the range of emotion they’d normally feel because now they’re off campus,” he added.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In an interview, Segura-Esquivel assured that despite the loss, “I’m still gonna be around, I’m still gonna be doing as much work on this campus as possible, still advocating for my communities.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Foreman declined to comment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In another Campus United victory, Internal Vice President-elect Tianna White will preside over the A.S. Senate next year, winning over Isla Vista Party competitor Racquel Almario.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">White said she is proud of those who ran for seats this year and is looking forward to improving the workings of the Senate table in the school year to come.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“As someone who ran for Senate last year, it takes a lot, I know. I’m really excited for this year’s A.S. to institute real change for the students on this campus,” White said. “It’s our immense privilege to be as informed and engaged with the student body.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almario did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both External Vice President positions went to Isla Vista Party candidates, with Yasamin Salari taking the seat for External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and Alia Reynolds winning External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though the A.S. executive branch is split between the two parties, EVPLA-elect Salari — who won against Campus United’s Lea Toubian — said she is up for the challenge of working with people across party lines.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Parties [are] something you run with, but I’m super excited to just set those aside once we get into office and just figure out how we can all help out each other and keep going,” Salari said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Salari said she doesn’t plan to waste time in preparing for next year’s work.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m really excited to get the applications out for my office and hire people who are passionate about the job, who are involved, and just get the ball rolling. I don’t want to wait until summer. I’m really excited to just start building the office.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The race for EVPSA was the closest executive race of the night, with Reynolds winning by a 3.1% margin, or 159 votes. She said the online format of the elections results added anxiety to an already emotional night for candidates.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“It was super stressful and the whole aspect of it being all digital made it harder for everyone’s mental health because digitizing everything can cause changes in self-perception,” Reynolds said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both Reynolds and her opponent Beau Karnsrithong said the results had them on the edge of their seats.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“It’s like watching a literal race to the finish line as your bar slides down the screen,” said Karnsrithong, who held the lead in the first half of the results release.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Definitely nerve wracking, but exciting and gets your heart pumping.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The position of Student Advocate General –– an independent executive position that requires students to disaffiliate from campus parties –– went to Melissa Perez, who beat her opponent Tyler Ferguson with 53.5% of the vote.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m so honored and blessed to be serving as your next student advocate general!” Perez said in a text. “I’m honored to be helping to make AS more accessible to students of all backgrounds and I’m ready to make it a reality!”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ferguson declined to comment on election results. While he lost the executive position, Ferguson still took a win tonight with the passage of the constitutional amendment to create two new <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-26/a-s-senate-amendment-puts-two-international-student-senator-seats-onto-spring-ballot/\">international student senator seats,</a> which were placed on the ballot by a bill he wrote while serving as a senator. The addition of those two seats, bringing the Senate table up to 27 seats in total, will go into effect in the 2020-21 election cycle.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All reaffirmations on this year’s ballot passed. The sole new fee on the ballot, a fee for the Department of Public Worms, passed with 77.56% of the vote.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the second year in a row that voter turnout has dropped — 28.84% of undergraduate students voted this year, down 3.51% from last year. According to the A.S. Elections Board, 6,243 undergraduate students voted in this year’s election, as opposed to the 6,980 who voted in the 2018-19 election.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The board had concerns about meeting the 20% voter threshold for this year’s election, given the circumstances of the online spring quarter.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The results night suffered technical difficulties and started almost 30 minutes after the official start time as the A.S. Elections Board struggled to share the voting results through the Zoom call.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“We really couldn’t figure out what was going on,” Quan said. “We did do run-throughs a bit prior and it looked fine, but in the actual results it did look a bit worse.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the results on the screen lagged due to the technical issues, which Quan said took away from the momentum and overall experience of the night.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“You do kind of feel bad for the candidates that they sort of lost all the events that went along with the actual election in terms of campaigning and results night, as well as anything else that entails in the election season.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“But overall, I really think that this election and the adaptation to online went very well considering the fears that we had going in.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Sanya Kamidi, Arturo Martinez Rivera, Harper Lambert and Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-90039\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 3D printer in the CNSI produces protective face shields for medical workers at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital</span>. <em>Courtesy of the CNSI</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while most of the campus remains silent, the 3D printer in the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), located in Elings Hall on campus, hums steadily day through night, producing protective face shields for medical workers at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Magnuson, a third-year mechanical engineering student at UCSB, usually starts his shift in the lab in the afternoon once he’s finished with his classes for the day; he works into the evening, sometimes staying until 9 p.m., or returns to the lab after having dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The routine makes for a long day for Magnuson, but the extra hours in the lab and late nights are worth it, he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After a long day of work, your body starts to hurt and you’re really tired, but it’s reinvigorating to know that these devices are going straight from our hands to the hospital,” Magnuson said. “I think that that’s really what’s keeping me going right now, just the fact that we can have such an immediate impact.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The urgent production of face shields on campus is just one example of how skilled students, researchers and scientists from UCSB are uniting to help the community through the coronavirus pandemic. When the campus was still open, another group of researchers in the Materials Department made batches of hand sanitizer for community use. And presently, professors across campus are developing a coronavirus test that would be simpler and faster than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coronavirus test.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Face Shield Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in the CNSI lab, Magnuson and David Bothman, the organizer behind the face shield production, work opposite shifts to keep the 3D printer running to produce as many parts as possible for the face shields. The shields, which are meant to go over medical goggles and face masks, consist of a transparent shield, headband and strap, all based off a </span><a href=\"https://budmen.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">design created by a 3D printer manufacturer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By early April, the team had created and delivered 40 face shields to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and had 40 more ready for delivery. But the hospital’s needs are “tremendous,” said Bothman, who normally lectures on mechanical engineering at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hospital needs 10,000 shields of the style we’re making. We can make, you know, 20 or 30 a day … but it’s clear that a lot of other people and people with a lot more manufacturing capability are going to need to be involved,” Bothman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other groups on campus have joined in the production of face shields, including Roger Green, manager at the chemistry and biochemistry machine shop. He and Andy Weinberg, the machine shop superintendent, obtained enough materials to make 3,000 face shields. The two had finished cutting the clear plastic covers for 200 shields with a 3D printer in early April and with the help of a couple more people in the production process, Green said his team would likely soon be able to produce about 200 clear plastic covers a day.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hand Sanitizer Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over in the Materials Department, Assistant Professor Angela Pitenis had been worrying about the coronavirus pandemic early on. Before </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB canceled in-person classes on March 10</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, she cut the normal lesson plans she had for her graduate class, Colloids and Interfaces,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and instead presented on the colloidal formation and stability properties of hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking notice of the rising anxiety over coronavirus among the students in her class, she decided to dedicate a lecture to demonstrate how to make basic hand sanitizer. Then she had the idea to produce hand sanitizer for the entire campus community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This whole project really began as a truly class exercise to demonstrate basic principles, but it also links back to the work that we do every day in materials science,” Pitenis said. “I think it was a very good lesson for the students to be able to see how lessons in the classroom can translate to practical engineering solutions, especially in response to COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining forces with colleagues Rachel Segalman, Raphaële Clément, Craig Hawker, Christopher Bates and Michael Chabinyc, all professors in the UCSB Materials Department, the group pooled together their reagents to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in their labs for community usage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basically, any kinds of solutions we could find, we would put them together,” Pitenis recalled. She said she isn’t sure how much hand sanitizer they made altogether, but she estimates “gallons.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Segalman’s lab members, chemical engineering doctoral student Audra Destefano, came up with the creative idea to design a label and call their hand sanitizer “Universal Corona Sanitizing Balm.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The name], which was very clever … really encapsulated the efforts we were trying to do here, which was to support our community,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scientists distributed their hand sanitizer around campus, including among their shared facilities, the Materials Research Lab and the CNSI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the hand sanitizer went directly to those shared facilities to support students and staff at the time who were still having to use those shared facilities to maintain their critical research, and also to support our staff, who might not have time in between experiments to wash their hands,” Pitenis described.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Pitenis emphasized handwashing over hand sanitizer, noting that it is more effective and a practice that the CDC </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/pdf/hand-sanitizer-factsheet.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommends</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since campus operations, including most research labs, have shut down, Pitenis and her colleagues have ceased their hand sanitizer production, for now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’ve made enough to support the needs of our community,” she remarked, adding that if there was a need for more, her team could always produce additional hand sanitizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’re all trying to help out as much as we can; I think this is a total team effort right now. And I’m just incredibly amazed and I’m just humbled by the efforts of my colleagues,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><b>Coronavirus Test Development </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across campus, four professors from the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) are working tirelessly to develop a coronavirus test that would be faster and easier to use and would not “rely on the common reagents that the rest of the world is scrambling to get,” said Max Wilson, an assistant professor in the MCDB department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson, Carolina Arias, Diego Acosta-Alvear and Kenneth Kosik all know each other from teaching and working together in the MCDB department, but as the coronavirus pandemic tore through U.S. communities and the lack of available testing became more obvious, the group stepped up to help fill the gap in resources and information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw that there was a massive need for testing and we decided that we would use our labs and our skills as molecular biologists to help,” Wilson said. “We were all scientists studying other things before this. We dedicated funds from [other projects] to develop this because we saw how important it was.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the CDC’s test as a benchmark for accuracy, the team created a test for coronavirus that uses an enzyme similar to the family of enzymes used in a CRISPR test, a method that </span><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/coronavirus-test-crispr-mammoth-biosciences/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scientists around the nation have already begun to tap into</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that targets repetitive DNA sequences. This test uses the enzyme to recognize the presence of the coronavirus viral genome and indicates a positive or negative result on a lateral flow dipstick, a testing device similar to those used for pregnancy tests, according to Wilson.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the beginning of April, the group was tinkering with adjustments to the test to make it cheaper and easier to use. The professors also began looking into the process of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, which is currently being fast tracked for coronavirus tests but could still likely take months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s gonna be a long way, unfortunately,” Arias said. “We are still far. I don’t want to give anybody false expectations or false hope </span>that we’re going to have something that can be deployed tomorrow. It is a process [that requires] approval.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to developing a new coronavirus test, the professors </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also donated enough critical reagents, an essential component in the current CDC coronavirus test, for 600 tests to the Cottage Health laboratory, the Santa Barbara Independent </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/04/02/ucsb-molecular-biologists-to-the-rescue/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arias’ role in the project has been to coordinate approval processes and navigate protocols for the research to take place. Besides that, she also teaches general animal virology to a class of 185 students remotely –– a task faced by UCSB’s entire teaching faculty and one they had a mere </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-24/pandemic-pedagogy-faculty-prepares-for-first-quarter-of-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two weeks to prepare for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> –– and serves on UCSB’s COVID-19 Response Working Group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And we have families so we don’t stop. If it’s not one thing, it’s another one,” Arias said. “I cannot even tell you at what time [the day] begins or what time it ends.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the researchers are propelled by an extreme sense of urgency to find solutions and provide information to the public, a collective effort they “hope is going to be significant” in the community’s fight against coronavirus, Arias said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the team is discussing the possibility of using their coronavirus test in a research project that would focus on the prevalence of coronavirus in asymptomatic patients. The project could reveal information about how the virus spreads, but until the test is FDA approved, patients involved in the project would not be able to know the results of the testing, Wilson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While much remains uncertain about the timeline of their projects and the future in general, Wilson, Arias, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acosta-Alvear and Kosik are steadfast in their mission to help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people might feel helpless and I just want to reassure them that many of the best scientists I know are working as hard as they possibly can to come up with solutions that will ease the pain on this pandemic,” Wilson said. “There are things coming.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
