But each year the holiday season brings a much more severe disappointment to children around the world: the realization that Santa Claus isn’t real.</p>\n<p>We all have our own story of discovery, and the <em>Nexus </em>asked five UC Santa Barbara students to share the moment they discovered the magical man was, in fact, a legend.</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Sam Lewis said he was sick and home from school one day when his mom sat him down, holding an article about Saint Nicholas to show he was real at some point.</p>\n<p>“Then she said, ‘Even though [Santa Claus] is gone, his spirit still lives on through Christmas, and now you’re part of the knowing club because Santa Claus doesn’t really exist — we’re Santa Claus,’” Lewis said. “‘Your brother isn’t part of the club, so don’t tell him. When he’s about your age, we’ll tell him as well.’ And so for the next couple of years, I was in the know and I thought I was in this cool, exclusive club.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Varshini Satish said she was eager to catch Santa Claus one year with her dad. The two of them camped out by the fireplace on Christmas Eve with baseball bats and a garbage bag to catch Santa.</p>\n<p>“I tried to stay awake as long as I could, but I eventually fell asleep,” Satish said. “At some point I woke up when I heard a movement. My dad told me he had gone to get a glass of water, but I saw presents under the tree and I looked at the handwriting on them and it all clicked in my brain.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Camila Holm’s parents were not ready to tell her the truth about Santa Claus when her aunt spoiled the secret one year.</p>\n<p>“My mom always had special wrapping paper and special tags for Santa to use and then when my aunt came to visit, she mixed them up,” Holm said. “So then Santa and my aunt had the same wrapping paper and when I asked my mom about it, I found out.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Travis Kim discovered the sad reality when he supposedly misread the calendar one year.</p>\n<p>“Santa came on [December] 24th . . . I asked my mom why and she said, ‘Everyone makes mistakes — even Santa,’” Kim said. “But Santa never makes mistakes . . . that’s when I knew.”</p>\n<p>For some, like first-year biology major Sunaina Kongara, the illusion of Santa Claus and his reindeer never existed.</p>\n<p>“I never believed in Santa because my dad was too lazy,” Kongara said. “He wouldn’t even wait until we fell asleep to put presents under the tree or eat all the cookies.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 in the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/","id":2602,"author":{"id":140,"name":"Olivia Pla"},"related":[2601,2600,2599],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"El Centro Hosts Second Annual Open House To Show its Role as a Safe Space on Campus","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/El-Centro_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/El-Centro_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"El Centro held its second annual open house on Thursday to educate students on its role as a safe haven for organizations and people of color.

The event was hosted by Mesa Directiva, a conglomerate of all the organizations that meet in El Centro, including El Congreso, Students for Justice in Palestine and Radio Xicana.</p>\n<p>Second-year English major Lorena Alvarez said she did not feel at home on campus until she found El Centro, and was hopeful Thursday’s open house would help students find a secure place.</p>\n<p>“For me, El Centro is a home, and I want to provide an opportunity for students to find a home like I did because I know I was lost on campus last year, and without El Centro I probably would not have stayed at UCSB,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history and math double-major Minal Habash said until she discovered El Centro, it was hard to find people who understood the difficulties of minority students at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“For minorities, it’s hard to find support with a lot of the problems that we face, but El Centro is a great place to come to be able to find other people who also feel unappreciated on this campus,” Habash said. “It was the first place on campus where I really felt safe.”</p>\n<p>Habash said El Centro does not have the same amenities as other buildings. Until recently, El Centro did not have lights outside the building, nor was it labeled on the campus map.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said El Centro has also had to deal with the adverse effects of being located next to the library, which has been under construction. Now that many of the construction fences, which had obstructed students’ view of the building, are gone, Mesa Directiva wanted to host an open house to show students that the building exists.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Ocil Yuleima Herrejón Rivera said El Centro has been facing obstacles ever since she was a freshman. She said many of the problems are due to the fact that El Centro is a student-run building, making it more difficult for the students to get simple necessities in the building like a hydration station, outdoor lights and computers.</p>\n<p>El Centro’s second floor is reserved for engineers, but students say engineers rarely use it because they have their own, separate building. Rivera and many students who use El Centro would like to use the second floor to increase the resources for students who need help.</p>\n<p>“In these years we’ve really tried to help El Centro grow, and part of that has been trying to have access to the second floor,” Rivera said. “It would only make sense for it to grow upward instead of to another building. Having access to the second floor would allow us to have more resources for different students of color on campus.”</p>\n<p>As El Centro strives to accomplish these goals, the students will continue to host an open house every year to grow the membership of the organizations that meet there.</p>\n<p>First-year math major Matt Uffenheimer attended the event and was glad to know the building’s purpose.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wondered what the building was for. I had no idea it was a meeting place for so many organizations and people,” Uffenheimer said. “Even though I’m not a student of color, I’m glad I’m now aware of the importance of this building to the people who use it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

of Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), an international organization advocating an end to the “war on drugs” approach to substance control.</p>\n<p>Garcia, a second-year biology major, and Minoiefar, a third-year history of public policy major, aim to educate students on the war on drugs, explore alternative approaches and promote smart decisions regarding drug use. A group of students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst led by Shea Gunther founded SSDP in 1998, and the organization has grown to include thousands of members from hundreds of campuses worldwide.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s SSDP chapter is currently going through the campus organization registration process with the Office of Student life and seeking a faculty advisor, but has already been active on campus and has a club constitution. For a chapter to be officially recognized by the organization, it must have at least three students and actively organize on campus.</p>\n<p>Pacific outreach coordinator for SSDP Frances Fu said she can help connect SSDP efforts across campuses.</p>\n<p>“For example, the UC Davis chapter is currently spearheading a Good Samaritan policy at their school and would like to make it a statewide effort,” Fu said in an email. “Part of my job is facilitating those relationships and partnerships.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said he hopes to help install a local Good Samaritan policy, which would grant legal immunity to someone who calls the police or medical personnel for an injured person.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times a person’s friends or peers are scared of law enforcement and the repercussions that would come with calling an ambulance and getting the authorities involved,” Garcia said. “We’d like to make it easier for people who need help with drugs and alcohol to seek help for something like an overdose.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said he hopes to convey to students the many effects of national and local drug policy.</p>\n<p>“I’d like for SSDP to educate students on how drug policy is related to a variety of other social issues, like unemployment and the economy, education, health care and racial injustice,” Garcia said. “If students understand how reforming drug policy will improve society in these other areas, then they will understand how necessary drug policy reform actually is.”</p>\n<p>To publicize the new chapter, members have been tabling and handing out information around campus. Garcia plans to eventually hold documentary screenings and invite guest speakers to campus to discuss drug policy.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Catherine Lee says that SSDP will be a good addition to UCSB’s campus organizations because many students do not understand the implications of drug policy and the effects of drug use.</p>\n<p>“It sounds similar to what we learned in AlcoholEdu online over the summer, but I think this program will be more successful in communicating messages to students if they do everything in person through things like guest speakers and events,” Lee said. “Unfortunately, I don’t think most students registered most of the information presented to them online in AlcoholEdu.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said he decided to create the UCSB chapter of SSDP because he felt not having a local Good Samaritan policy discourages students from aiding others in in dangerous situations to avoid legal repercussions.</p>\n<p>Like Garcia, Minoiefar said he would like to change local policy to encourage students to intervene in potentially dangerous situations.</p>\n<p>“A big thing the chapter can do is push a policy like the Good Samaritan policy at the university,” Minoiefar said. “The school can put in its policy that if you get help for someone in need … and if it is decided that a person did it in good faith, they won’t be in trouble.”</p>\n<p>As the new chapter of SSDP grows at UCSB, Minoiefar said he hopes to amass a big enough following to continue running the program once both co-founders graduate.</p>\n<p>“These types of initiatives, like the Good Samaritan policy, tend to die out when a student like me leaves because then all the information and things I’ve learned leave with me,” Minoiefar said. “By building this chapter, we hope to be able to create new student leaders who can continue this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66175\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66175\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/66175/","id":2637,"author":{"id":140,"name":"Olivia Pla"},"related":[2636,2635,2634],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/140"}},"__N_SSG":true}
