The low, heavy mist reflected the lights of State Street with an orange glow, and kids shuffled around outside the gate of D.I.Y. space Bici Centro between cigarettes and quiet words. The asphalt-covered space behind the gate housed 20 more people chatting among themselves listening to the first soundcheck. It was obvious that most of the people inside knew each other. There was a nervous energy that filled the air as the first band, Little Bitch, took the stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outside crowd began to trickle in as Rose Nadis, lead vocalist of Little Bitch, stood at the mic. Stragglers from the outside crowd, lamenting the five dollars they had to pay in entry, filed through the gate for their stamp and joined the crowd. The band seemed to swell as the show carried on, becoming bolder and obviously having more fun as their friends began to shed the cool-guy affect generally associated with being at a show labeled “D.I.Y.” –– which, of course, stands for “Do It Yourself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With whimsical lyrics and a healthy amount of power chords, Little Bitch’s sound falls squarely in-between Neutral Milk Hotel and Beat Happening. It’s easy to see where they are drawing influence from –– and that’s a good thing. As musician Ian Svenonius of National of Ulysses, The Make Out, Escape-ism and countless other projects said to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earlier this year, every good band is essentially a cover band. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dramatic climax of the set came at the peak of a song called “Pants-less Michael,” during which keyboard player, backup vocalist and band namesake Mikol Bitch (spelling as relayed to me by other band members while Mikol himself was hiding from angry concert-goers) tore off all his clothes and went careening into the crowd of teenagers. Most opted to part themselves instead of engage with the young man until he connected squarely with an unsuspecting friend of a friend, head buried in her phone mid-set. Mikol Bitch’s wiry frame connected with the girl and she subsequently connected with the asphalt. Mikol sprang up unfazed and charged back to the keys for the end of the song as his new friend charged straight out of the gate, learning a valuable lesson in show etiquette that she surely will not forget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The value of D.I.Y. shows like this is their teachable moments. The bands and audience are all one in learning how to put on a show. While it often feels like the underground has become pop culture in traditionally hip places like Los Angeles or San Francisco, the environment in Santa Barbara feels welcoming. The barrier to entry is relaxed, giving more space and an authentic platform for bands like Little Bitch to figure out how to be a band. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acts from Santa Barbara help each other. The series of shows this summer at Bici Centro is, in part, organized by Ruben Zarate, the enigmatic frontman of Santa Barbara-based Dante Elephante. With his own band experiencing some success and earning praise for their project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anglo-Saxon Summer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Zarate turned inward and is helping foster a new wave of local groups coming from Santa Barbara’s D.I.Y. scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zarate, along with indie label Last Resort Forever, are helping to fill the void left by the popular D.I.Y. venue FUNZONE’s closing last year. FUNZONE, which occupied the old maintenance shed for the batting cages on Milpas in the back of East Beach Tacos, came alive at night with youthful energy. As Santa Barbara’s only all-ages venue for three years, it was at the heart of the scene. Local kids had a safe, substance-free space where their music was the focus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a five-dollar donation, you got a night of music at FUNZONE –– a staple in the lives of those who frequented the spot. Spencer vonHershman, manager of the East Beach Batting Cages where FUNZONE resided, started the venue as an experiment. It quickly became a breeding ground for local talent, with a regular cast including Little Bitch and Cave Babies. With the demise of FUNZONE, the shows at Bici Centro are now vital to the survival of the scene and to the cultivation of talent in the 805 area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FUNZONE helped teach bands to be good members of the musical community. It’s understood in the underground scene that FUNZONE created a platform for alternative, indie and punk fans alike, and it connected both bands and fans to a sense of place that was once hard to find in an upper-class town with 21-plus venues and large stadium shows. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D.I.Y. venues along with self-organized house shows in Isla Vista provide a space for young alternative and indie bands that did not exist in years prior. Notable acts currently coming out of Santa Barbara, such as Clean Spill, Mellow Grass and The Anti Shiest, have created their own network, organizing shows that gather hundreds of people into Isla Vista backyards a couple nights a week. The big local names draw the crowds that lend exposure to the newer acts on the bill, and the significance of that kind of exposure to a young audience cannot be understated. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anti-Shiest is an act formed in Santa Barbara that has been paying their dues locally for the last few years. The boys have earned their spot as resident lords of the Isla Vista backyard scene. No proper I.V. backyard show is proper without them on the bill, and they do a large part in drawing crowds for new and visiting bands alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Santa Barbara] scene is fucking rad,” says Sam Deeley, the notoriously shaggy lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for The Anti Shiest. Often likened to a golden retriever, Deeley plays shows like a hardened veteran with power and a shark-eyed gaze. Through position changes, drunken fumbles and beer-soaked equipment, Deeley along with Mikey Threet and Dan Carrol have been making waves that stretch farther than the 805. “Anyone looking to start up a band needs to lose the hesitation and indecision,” the band agreed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sentiment epitomizes what makes Santa Barbara’s D.I.Y. scene so special — people and places like Ruben Zarate, FUNZONE and The Anti Shiest who share a strong sense of community and respect for the people and places that raised them. The D.I.Y. ethos is alive and well in Santa Barbara, California. Ask for help, connect with those who are doing it, and “If they blow you off, then they aren’t a part of our scene.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/under-the-radar-a-profile-of-the-sb-diy-scene/","id":6621,"author":{"id":693,"name":"Sean Edwards"},"related":[6620,6619,6618],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Orwells Set to Rock Velvet Jones this Saturday","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Previews: What's Going On","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-18-at-6.11.11-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-18-at-6.11.11-PM.png?resize=606%2C381&ssl=1","description":"Imperfection is The Orwells’ comfort zone, and no live performance is exactly as recorded.

The two bands are stopping in Santa Barbara on their collective tour of the West Coast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Illinois natives The Orwells are notorious for fast paced rock n’ roll and an insane stage presence. The band is comprised of Mario Cuomo on vocals, Dominic Corso and Matt O’Keene on guitars, Grant Brinner on bass and his twin brother Henry on drums. The Orwells released their debut album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember When </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on Autumn Tone Records to critical acclaim, earning them a slot at Lollapalooza and on the Late Show with David Letterman. The Orwells have an in-your-face, loud and distorted sound paired with angsty and arrogant lyrics. Their authenticity is refreshing. It’s raw, emotional and completely uninterested in what you think; The Orwells strike a similar sound to Suicidal Tendencies, who were newcomers on the punk scene 30 years ago. They connect to the youth because they are young, and neither on purpose or on accident, their music matches the disinterested, dissatisfied and bored sentiments of teenage life in middle America. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The powerful music comes with a live performance to match, with Mario Cuomo habitually tearing off all his clothes in Iggy Pop fashion. Imperfection is The Orwells’ comfort zone, and no live performance is exactly as recorded. The Orwells are consistently off the wall, but behind the leather-clad punks there is immense musical talent that has vaulted the band from high school garage band to staples of the rock n’ roll scene. They are an indispensable part of the conversation, and are sure to shock us this Saturday. They are currently on tour, playing their way down the coast and ending at The Smell in Los Angeles at the end of the month. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting the Orwells on the North American leg of their tour is Dante Elephante, local surf rockers from UCSB. Theirs is a darker take on classic Southern California surf rock which has placed them at the forefront of the new class of indie groups. They have landed on L.A.-based indie rock label Lollipop Records, working with big-name collaborators such as Jonathan Rado of Foxygen. Drawing on their roots in Santa Barbara and personal experiences  to create an inviting upbeat sound with a lo-fi vibe, Dante Elephante dares you to look beneath the surface of the ideal Southern California lifestyle. Ruben Zarate and Kevin Boutin on guitar create consistently interesting riffs and chilling vocals that portray a culture rife with drug abuse and hard lessons, while Tommy Devoy on drums and Johnny Lopez on bass hold the sound together with fast-paced beats complimented by Erich Tomkinson’s synths. All together, the band creates a sound that stands out and resonates with those who have grown up in beach communities up and down the California coast. Dante Elephante started at UCSB but has climbed out of the college band persona and proven to be more than a drunken Isla Vista night in your buddies’ garage. They are turning into an artistic force; the future looks bright.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Saturday at Velvet Jones will be an insane combination of screaming, moshing, stage dives, nudity and powerful music. These talented young musicians take the stage at 8:30 p.m., with the potential of a beautifully mad rock n’ roll show. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74331\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/the-orwells-set-to-rock-velvet-jones-this-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74331\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/the-orwells-set-to-rock-velvet-jones-this-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/the-orwells-set-to-rock-velvet-jones-this-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/the-orwells-set-to-rock-velvet-jones-this-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/the-orwells-set-to-rock-velvet-jones-this-saturday/","id":6536,"author":{"id":693,"name":"Sean Edwards"},"related":[6535,6534,6533],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/693"}},"__N_SSG":true}
