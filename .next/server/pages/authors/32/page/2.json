Junior utility Sarah Snyder had four goals in the matchup while senior attacker Sarah Kreiser and freshman utility Caitlyn Snyder had hat tricks of their own. While the offense was stellar against the Matadors, the defense also deserves high praise as both goalkeepers, sophomore goalkeeper Becca Buck and junior goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, combined for 11 saves in the game.</p>\n<p>Hawaii is having a tremendous year and has won six of their last nine matchups. The Rainbow Wahine are led by senior attacker Irene Gonzalez who has 50 goals and 24 assists on the season thus far. Since Gonzalez is a willing passer, she has been a nightmare for her opponents because they are unable to double team her.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Defensively, the Rainbow Wahine are led by freshman goalkeeper Bridget Layburn, who has 86 saves on the year along with an overall record of 10-3 in the games she has played in.</p>\n<p>In order for Santa Barbara to pull off the upset, they will need to continue to play stout defense against a high powered Hawaii offense. This means that UCSB’s goalkeepers must continue to rack up saves while also maintaining strong communication with their back line. Both Buck and Snyder have split time in front of the cage and will likely do the same in this upcoming matchup.<br>\n“We are lucky that we have two strong keepers,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “They both push each other and really respect each other. I’m very excited about both of them.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, Snyder must continue to be the leader on the offensive end of the pool. She now has 60 goals on the year — a team high — along with six assists. Dating back to last season, she has always been a proficient scorer for the ’Chos, but this season she has really developed as a leader as well.</p>\n<p>“She is very special and has really taken her game to another level,” Kay explained. “In anything she does, she excels. You can talk about people being good and great but she is in the elite category.”</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Caitlyn Snyder, who is the sister of Sarah Snyder, has been a great surprise for UCSB as she has made an impact on both sides of the pool. With her 25 goals this year, she ranks fourth on the team which has provided stability for Santa Barbara offensively. With so many offensive threats, it makes the squad extremely difficult to defend, especially during power plays.<br>\n“Caitlyn’s upside is through the roof,” Kay stated. “She creates on the counter, can score from the perimeter, as well as can fill the center role. Her versatility is extremely valuable and she has a very bright future ahead of her.”</p>\n<p>One of the reasons why Santa Barbara has been so successful as of late is because the team is playing with extreme confidence. It is clear that there is an immense amount of trust on the team which has led to their positive results. Despite being an extremely young group, the ’Chos have been able to develop the chemistry necessary to win against difficult opponents.</p>\n<p>UCSB is back in action this Saturday, April 13 at 9 p.m. in Hawaii as they look to pick up their 20th win of the season.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87381\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-11-ucsb-wapo-looks-to-upset-no-4-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87381\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-11-ucsb-wapo-looks-to-upset-no-4-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-11-ucsb-wapo-looks-to-upset-no-4-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-11-ucsb-wapo-looks-to-upset-no-4-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-11-ucsb-wapo-looks-to-upset-no-4-hawaii/","id":4862,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4861,4860,4859],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look To Bolster Conf.

The Matadors are led by junior utility Tori Wilson, who is coming off a hat trick in her most recent game, giving her a team-leading 57 goals on the year. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its last matchup against No. 10 UC Irvine, CSUN was outscored by nine goals as it was unable to keep the Anteaters from finding the back of the net. Despite a strong effort from Wilson as well as junior utility Jennalyn Barthels, who netted two goals, the Matadors were unable to keep up with the high-powered offense of UC Irvine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though CSUN has not had the year that they wanted, they are still a very dangerous team that is trying to develop the right habits in order to have a better season next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Gauchos to have success in this matchup, they will need to continue to have strong play from their two leaders on the offensive end, Snyder and freshman attacker Amanda Legaspi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The duo has proved to be very effective for the Gauchos as they have consistently made an impact on the offensive side of the pool, whether by scoring goals or creating opportunities for their teammates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snyder, in particular, is having another fantastic season, as she has netted 56 goals, 5 assists and 15 steals. She has also provided veteran leadership to an extremely  young team that consists of nine freshmen and only two seniors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior utility Kate Pipkin has also been a huge part of why UCSB has been so successful this year, as she has 34 goals and 23 assists this season. Her strong play has prevented opposing teams from double-teaming Snyder, allowing them both to have success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although some believed that it would take time for the team to develop the chemistry necessary to win games, the Gauchos have been able to find their rhythm behind strong teamwork and communication in the pool. This constant communication has led to an increase in steals and a decrease in fouls committed, which has kept the pressure off of their goalkeeper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the major reasons Santa Barbara has been able to win the majority of its games this season has been its dramatically improved defense from a year ago. In their last six matchups, the Gauchos have only given up an average of eight goals per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can also be attributed to the strong play of junior goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who leads the team with 132 saves on the year. It is clear that her confidence has grown since last year, which is showing in her improved results in front of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara will look to get back on track this Saturday at Cal State Northridge, where they will match up against the Matadors at 12 p.m.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara honored their only senior, redshirt Paris Jones, before the game. Jones averaged two points and a rebound in a little more than 10 minutes of play on the season as well as provided veteran leadership for the young ‘Chos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a hot start for both teams as they each shot 47.1 percent from the field. Redshirt junior guard Coco Miller led the way for the Gauchos with five quick points, as she helped create a three-point lead at the end of the first quarter. Miller has been the squad’s most reliable scorer as she is averaging a team high 13 points per game this year.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore guard Keilanei Cooper was the early spark for Riverside as she had eight points, including two three-pointers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second quarter would be a defensive battle between both squads, which was a stark contrast from the first quarter. Senior forward Malou De Kergret for UCR struggled mightily in the period as she went one for eight from the field. UCSB would head into halftime with a one point lead, as they looked to make their second half adjustments to extend their lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara ended up dominating the third quarter as they outscored the highlanders by nine points. Miller was on fire as she knocked down three three-pointers, giving her 16 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she has been inconsistent at times, Miller has been huge for the ‘Chos in their wins. As the group’s best scorer, she has shown the ability to not only knock down three-point shots but also attack the basket. With the season coming close to the end, many fans will look forward to seeing her take her game to another level next season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB would carry this momentum into the fourth quarter and win the game fairly comfortably by 17 points. Sophomore guard Danae Miller was able to find her rhythm late in the ball game as she scored nine points. Jones checked into the game with two minutes remaining but was unable to score on her layup attempt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may have been the Gauchos best defensive quarter all season as they held the highlanders to just five points and 14 percent from the field. UCR was unable to find any rhythm on offense due to the consistent ball pressure and good defense by Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this being a rebuilding season for UCSB, there is much to be excited about for next season. Everyone from the team except Paris Jones will be returning, allowing the team to grow together with little turnover. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have shown flashes throughout the year but have not been able to string together victories. With the squad continuing to develop their chemistry, they will surely make an impact in the Big West Conference for the next couple seasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would have been easy for Santa Barbara to stop giving their best effort during their tough stretches but head coach Bonnie Henrickson was able to keep the team on course. By continuing to play hard, the team has started to be rewarded by getting more wins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their past five matchups, UCSB has been able to win three of them, showing that they have taken major strides from earlier in the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They will put their two game winning streak on the line this upcoming Saturday in their last game of the regular season at 2:30 p.m against UC Davis. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Coming off one of her best performances of the season against UC Irvine, it would be crucial for her to replicate a similar effort in order for UCSB to come away with the victory. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Cal State Fullerton, they were paced by redshirt sophomore Raina Perez who was on fire in the first quarter. Perez scored 10 points, including two three-pointers, to help put her team up one going into the second quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB would play a very well rounded second quarter as they were able to outscore Fullerton by four points in the period. With no turnovers in the second quarter, Santa Barbara was able to score fairly easily behind strong play from Miller who had two three-pointers in the period. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it was a strong quarter for the ‘Chos, Fullerton was still shooting 60 percent from the field which meant that UCSB would have to lock in defensively to keep them from continuously scoring easy baskets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third quarter was much of the same for both teams as they were both able to score without much resistance. Cal State Fullerton had eight more free throw attempts than Santa Barbara which could be attributed to them constantly putting pressure on the basket. CSUF’s senior Jade Vega got to the free throw line six times in the period and made all of her shots to help tie the game heading into the fourth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton was able to take over the game in the fourth quarter behind strong play from senior Hannah Thompson who erupted for 10 points in the period alone. At the four minute mark in a one-point contest, they would go on an 11 to nothing run to seal the win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller struggled mightily in this period as she went two for eight from the field, including one for seven from behind the three-point line. With UCSB lacking production from their most consistent scorer, it made it difficult for them to keep up with a red hot Fullerton squad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUF ended up shooting 59 percent from the field in the final quarter compared to a lowly 31 percent for UCSB, which was the reason why Santa Barbara was outscored by 12 points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the gauchos to be able to close out similar games in the future, they will need a second scorer to emerge behind Miller. Sophomore point guard Danae Miller has shown flashes throughout the season but has been unable to be consistent throughout the year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In UCSB’s wins, both Millers have not only played outstanding but have also provided important leadership to their younger teammates. It will be important for them to continue being vocal as the season comes closer to an end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just four games remaining in conference play, the gauchos will look to gain some momentum and improve their seed in the conference tournament which is coming up very soon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara is back in action at Long Beach State this Saturday, where they will look to pick up their fourth conference win at 4 p.m. at the Walter Pyramid.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

basketball team was unable to string together their second consecutive win in a row as they lost to Hawaii by 23 points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara entered this contest with an overall record of 5-17, with a 2-8 record in conference play. Despite struggling early on in the year, the squad had shown flashes especially with their most recent win against CSUN.

Both Coco Miller and Danae Miller struggled mightily from the field as they combined for zero for six. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawaii was led by junior guard Courtney Middap who had five quick points in the first period. Middap has been a stabilizing force for the Rainbow Wahine as she is averaging eight points on the season along with a team high two assists per game. They would end the first period with a four point lead, behind strong defense which created three turnovers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second quarter was much of the same as Hawaii was able to extend their lead to six points. It was less of a slugfest in the period as both teams started to find their rhythm offensively. Sophomore guard Bri Anugwom started to look for her shot more which led to six points behind two three pointers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the key takeaways from the first half was that Hawaii was able to get to the free throw line much more often than the gauchos as they shot four more free throws, which was really the only difference in the game thus far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game started to get away from Santa Barbara in the third period as the Rainbow Wahine outscored them by 15 points which gave them a commanding 21 point lead. Hawaii’s leading scorer Makenna Woodfolk started to get more involved as she hit two three-pointers while Middap continued her hot hand with six points, leading to a 17-to-nothing run in their favor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With UCSB down 21 at the start of the fourth period, they would be unable to chip into the lead and would end up losing by 23 points. The Gauchos shot 17 percent from the field in the final quarter, which made it impossible to get on any kind of run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This game seemed to follow the path of most UCSB games this year as they have struggled to find consistency on the offensive end of the floor. Much of this can be attributed to the team still lacking an identity, whether that be a gritty defensive team or a team that constantly attacks the paint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that must happen for UCSB to start having more success as the season comes closer to an end will be for both Coco Miller and Danae Miller to be more consistent on the offensive end of the floor. As the two leaders on the team, it will be up to them to make more of an impact and provide a spark for the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this being a rebuilding season for Santa Barbara, it will be important to take the positives away from every game this season. As long as they constantly give maximum effort, the results will start going in their favor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is back in action at home against UC Irvine this upcoming Saturday at 4 p.m. in the Thunderdome where they will look to get back on track. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

She was also able to make an impact on the defensive end with consistent rim protection as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a stalemate in the second, with both teams unable to create any separation from the other. Junior center Natalia Bruening would score five straight points to the start the quarter but would have to sit for most of the period due to foul trouble. Guard Danae Miller for the ‘Chos struggled mightily in the first half as she was 0 for 3 from the field, along with four turnovers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Santa Barbara to come away with the win, they would need both Millers to make more of an impact offensively while also providing veteran leadership. CSUN was able to add to its one-point lead in the third quarter behind strong play from Fluker and freshman guard Jordyn Jackson. Fluker showed off her consistent mid-range game as she scored 11 of the matador’s 16 points in the period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB found itself down six with just a minute left in the fourth quarter but would end up going on a final push to secure the win. Coco Miller was able to knock down a three-pointer to make it a three-point game and, after a turnover on CSUN’s next possession, Danae Miller was able to hit a clutch three-point shot to tie the game with 49 seconds left in the final period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following another turnover by the Matadors, Santa Barbara looked to run down the clock and go for the win. Sophomore guard Bri Anugwom was fouled with just eight seconds left and headed to the free-throw line. Despite missing the first, she was able to make the second, giving the Gauchos a one-point lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN put the ball in Fluker’s hands for the final shot, but she was unable to convert the mid-range jumper, handing the ‘Chos their second conference win of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a gutsy win for Santa Barbara as they climbed back despite falling behind by six points multiple times throughout the game. Danae Miller, in particular, showed her resilience as she was able to hit the game-tying three-point shot despite struggling for much of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this season being a rebuild for UCSB, it will be important for it to build upon these types of games to gain momentum for not only the remainder of this year but also for years to come. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will be back in action at Hawaii this upcoming Wednesday at 9 p.m. as they look to pick up their third win in conference play.

firing in the first quarter with sophomore point guard Danae Miller leading the way for the ‘Chos with a quick five points.

One of Long Beach State’s strength is their ability to make three pointers, which was on full display to start the game. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 49ers would go into the second quarter with a one point lead but UCSB would turn the tables as they outscored LBSU by three points, giving them a two-point lead going into halftime. Redshirt junior Coco Miller started to find her rhythm as she swished a couple mid-range jumpers which gave the Gauchos some momentum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller came into this game red hot as she had a career high scoring performance with 33 points, with 18 of those points coming from behind the three-point line. Although it was a slow start, she would make a huge impact in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither team could create separation from the other in the third period with both teams seemingly scoring at will. Junior center Natalie Bruening dominated in the post as she used her size to convert easy layups. For LBSU, junior forward Cydnee Kinslow had an outstanding third quarter with two threes as well as a couple of steals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bruening has started to find her confidence as of late on the offensive end of the floor as she is attacking the basket aggressively, leading to an increase in free throw attempts. Going forward, it will be crucial that she sustains this level of play because it will force defenses to double her in the paint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were finally able to gain some breathing room as they outscored the 49ers by six points in the final eight minutes to come away with the victory. Danae Miller not only hit a clutch mid-range floater with the shot clock about to expire but iced the game from the free throw line as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the keys behind their victory was their ability to hold the 49ers to 35 percent shooting from the field, which can be attributed to the persistent ball pressure. All five players on the court were communicating on the floor as well which kept LBSU from finding their rhythm offensively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another welcoming sight for UCSB was the balanced scoring between Danae Miller, Coco Miller and Bruening who combined for 46 of the team’s total 60 points. This is extremely encouraging for a team that has struggled to find a second scorer to emerge behind Coco Miller.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although sophomore guard Bri Anugwom did not make an impact scoring the ball, her contributions on the other end of the floor cannot be overlooked as she grabbed a career high fourteen rebounds in the contest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Gauchos to build upon this game, they will need to continue to bring maximum defensive effort as they still build chemistry on the offensive end. Moreover, they will need to continue to play team basketball and avoid the ball sticking in one place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will be back in action next week as it faces Cal State Fullerton at home on Thursday Jan. 24 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

As the second quarter wrapped up, UCSB was able to outscore the Lopes by 13 points, giving them a 19-point lead heading into halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They would cool off offensively in the third, however, as they were only able to score 10 points in the period. Grand Canyon made it a point of emphasis to pressure the ball more to start the second half which led to easy baskets on the other end. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the common trends throughout the early season is that the squad has been unable to respond when something does not go their way in the game. Despite the increased pressure, Santa Barbara continued to remain aggressive and was undeterred when they faced adversity for the first time in the game. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grand Canyon was able to find its rhythm however, particularly in the fourth quarter as the team scored 22 points and cut their deficit to just 11 points by the end of the game. They were led by senior center Sharon Miller who had 12 points on the night, while also going 8-for-8 from the free throw line. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bruening did a terrific job for the Gauchos as she was able to limit the post touches for Miller which prevented her from making more of an impact offensively. With her confidence growing every game, she will surely be one of the team’s best players by the end of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller has also been fantastic in the past few games as she has not only been making an impact offensively with her jumpshot but also has provided veteran leadership for the young group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the season has gone on, UCSB has started to play with more chemistry which has led to more fluidity on both ends of the floor. Statistically, they have been able to improve their field goal percentage as a result of an increase in communication on the floor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson, it is very encouraging to see the team continue to fight and remain locked in despite their disappointing start to the season. As they face more talented opponents in their upcoming games, they will look to rely on the habits that they are building now to help compete in those contests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are back in action next Saturday at 2 p.m. as they head to Pacific looking to go on their first win streak of the year. </span></p><div

UNLV tournament, as they look to get their first win on the year. Depending on the result of that matchup, they will play another team that will be determined by the result between the other teams in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off a 70-57 loss to Loyola Marymount. Despite going on multiple runs towards the end of the game, they could not make up for their poor play in the first quarter where they fell behind by ten points.</p>\n<p>There were positives to take away from the game however. Redshirt junior Coco Miller had a breakout game with twenty points and five assists. Junior guard Tal Sahar also stood out as she was four for seven from behind the three point line, finishing the night with 15 points and four rebounds.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB will look to build upon their defensive performance as they held Loyola Marymount to under 40% from the field, including 4-18 from three. That being said, they must also limit the amount of fouls they commit as they gave up 38 free throws for the lady rebels.</p>\n<p>UNLV comes into this game winless as well with their most recent loss coming against Gonzaga University. The lady rebels are led by senior forward Katie Powell who is averaging fifteen points on the year. In order for the ‘Chos to be successful in this contest, it will be crucial for them to limit Powell’s shots from distance where she is shooting 40% on the year.</p>\n<p>One of the common struggles that UCSB has faced early on in the season has been their inability to find an identity on the offensive end. While they did improve against Loyola Marymount with respect to shooting the ball more efficiently, their field goal percentage average is still under 35%.</p>\n<p>A major key towards improving their field goal percentage will be to get junior center Natalia Bruening more involved. Since she is the team’s best post player, she can score in the paint as well as get the ball to the team’s shooters when the double team comes.</p>\n<p>Another point of emphasis will be aggressively attacking the basket rather than simply swinging the ball from side to side. This should lead to more fouls called in favor of the ‘Chos which will likely bring up their 15.8 free throw line attempts per game even more.</p>\n<p>Moreover, attacking aggressively will create better looks from distance because the opposing team’s defense will be forced to collapse on the player who drives to the basket. Sophomore guard Bri Anugwom has been one of the few players who has constantly attacked the basket which is one of the reasons why she is near the top of the team in both free throws attempted (2.2 per game) and assists (1.8 per game).</p>\n<p>As the team plays more together, the consistency on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor will surely improve. With many new faces in the program this year, it is understandable that it will take time for the chemistry to grow amongst the players.</p>\n<p>Despite this group currently struggling, they have maintained a level of high energy despite when the game seems to be out of reach, a characteristic that is a welcome sight for head coach Bonnie Henrickson.</p>\n<p>Looking to end the month of November on a positive note, the Gauchos will try to pick up their first win as they face UNLV at 12 p.m. this Saturday, Nov. 24, in their first game at the UNLV tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Santa Barbara was getting ready to face No.8 Pepperdine, but the game was canceled due to the closure of the 101 freeway, which prohibited the Waves from making the trip.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the season ending early due to extremely unfortunate circumstances, it was an overall successful campaign for the ’Chos as they ended the year with an 18-8 record, 3-1 in conference play. After a disappointing season in 2017, they were able to rally and win seven more games than the prior year. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many attribute their turnaround to the stellar play from senior driver Boris Jovanovic, as he ended the year with 78 goals and 10 assists. By putting constant pressure on the defense, he was not only able to find the back of the net on many occasions but was also able to set up his teammates due to the attention he received from opposing defenses. Unfortunately, he could not be honored due to the cancelation of the Pepperdine matchup, which was Santa Barbara’s last home game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Jovanovic was a major contributor, there were other players who had just as much of an impact. Junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic was outstanding and contributed in every major category with 48 goals as well as a team-leading 25 assists, along with 37 steals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major characteristic of the Gaucho offense was the unselfish nature of every player. Five players had double-digits assists, which made the team difficult to defend especially when they had the advantage of a power play. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The selfless nature of the offense also led to 12 players having more than 10 goals on the season. With every player being a threat to net a goal, opponents struggled to hold down UCSB, which led to them averaging over 13 goals per contest. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Santa Barbara’s offense clearly improved, its defense also took major strides, primarily due to the play of freshman goalkeeper Tiago Bonchristiano.

Jovanovic led UCSB with six goals in their previous matchup.<br>\nUCSB will look to continue its strong defensive performance, as it has held its past two opponents under 10 goals. With the Waves playing its  best on the year, the Gauchos’ defense must communicate effectively, particularly when facing power plays.</p>\n<p>Throughout the year, the Gauchos have struggled to keep the ball out of the back of their net when being a man down, primarily due to defensive breakdowns.</p>\n<p>If they are able to limit them, they will be in prime position for defensive stops, which could lead to offensive success for them through fastbreaks.</p>\n<p>With all of the Waves’ attention certainly going toward stopping Jovanovic and junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic, other members on the UCSB team must step up in order to keep a strong defense.  Freshman attacker Sam Nangle and freshman driver Nathan Puentes were able to score in their last game, and it is prospected that the duo will make an impact in the last home game of the season for the ‘Chos.</p>\n<p>By maintaining constant pressure on the opponent’s half of the pool, they will be able to increase their amount of shots on goal, inevitably leading to more goals scored. As Santa Barbara wraps up the season, it will have the potential to increase its win count by eight games in comparison to last year. Many attribute the turnaround to the team’s selfless nature.</p>\n<p>Twelve players currently have more than 10 goals on the year, making the Gauchos extremely difficult to defend, since every player in the pool is an offensive threat.  Looking to pick up its fourth win at home on the year, UCSB will play Pepperdine at 12 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 10, in Jovanovic’s last home game as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 08, 2018, print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84814\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/gauchos-return-home-for-final-regular-season-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84814\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/gauchos-return-home-for-final-regular-season-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/gauchos-return-home-for-final-regular-season-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/gauchos-return-home-for-final-regular-season-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/gauchos-return-home-for-final-regular-season-match/","id":4880,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4879,4878,4877],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Return Home for GCC Match Against LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2018-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_10-web-e1540254586290.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_10-web-e1540254586290.jpg?resize=900%2C600&ssl=1","description":"After losing its last two games, UCSB will aim to regroup at home for its match against GCC conference foe Long Beach St.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79264\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_10-web-e1540254586290.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1854776391\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84509\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79264\" data-attachment-id=\"79264\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/no-10-ucsb-seeking-first-gcc-win-of-the-year/boris-jovanovic-searches-for-a-pass-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_10-web-e1540254586290.jpg?fit=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Boris Jovanovic searches for a pass.

Coming off a down-to-the-wire loss to No. 4 UC Berkeley by a score of 13-12, Santa Barbara will look to break its two-game losing streak and rebound against a 49er squad who has struggled mightily this season with a 7-10 record. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams are very familiar with each other, having faced each other twice on the year, with the ‘Chos getting the victory both times thus far. Last week, Long Beach State lost a more competitive match than the final score (6-13) would indicate to the No. 3 USC Trojans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the loss to USC, Long Beach is supported by redshirt junior attacker Austin Stewart leads the 49ers with 34 goals and six assists this season. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Losers of nine of their last 10 games, Long Beach State is desperate to break out of their recent struggles. During this stretch, they have been unable to find any sort of rhythm on offense, with an average of a mere eight goals per game. The 49ers will likely look towards Stewart to solidify an offensive attack heading into their Santa Barbara matchup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One major key to success for UCSB will be to keep the 49ers under 10 goals for the entire match, as the Gauchos have a record of 11-1 when this occurs. Sophomore goalkeeper Tiago Bonchristiano continues to gain more confidence in front of the net with the more experience he gets and has only allowed an average of 10 goals per game this month. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, it will be crucial for senior driver Boris Jovanovic to constantly put pressure on the 49er defense and remain involved offensively as he leads the team in goals. Coming off a huge five-goal game against Berkeley’s line of defense, Jovanovic should have no issue getting things started for the Gauchos again this week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an up-and-down month for Santa Barbara, one bright spot has been the play of its offense as the Gauchos have continued to find ways to find the back of the net, primarily due to the unselfish nature of the team. Four players currently have more than 10 assists, which makes the ‘Chos extremely hard to defend. This is especially true when teams are forced to put so much energy into containing Jovanovic up front. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As just three games remain on the schedule, UCSB will look to end the year on a high note and reach 19 wins on the season, which would be a major improvement from last year where the team finished the season with a sub-.500, 11-12 record. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the potential of an eight-game improvement, it is clear that the Gauchos have made major strides this season, in spite of losing a handful of close games to the nation’s top programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, with promising youth on the roster, UCSB and head coach Wolf Wigo will have plenty to work with going forward, with or without GCC success this season. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will play Long Beach State at 3 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 26, and will look to get their third win at home.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 8 in the Oct. 25th print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

to begin this Tuesday, there are plenty of storylines that are dominating the news already, starting with Jimmy Butler’s outburst in practice. During the Timberwolves practice session, Jimmy was seen calling out teammates, coaches, as well as Minnesota’s General Manager Scott Layden.</p>\n<p>To the basketball world, Butler is seen as a poised and collected player with a strong IQ for the game. Moreover, he is labeled as a leader that acts as the glue that keeps the team together. Quite frankly, he is the last person that anyone would expect to belittle his teammates, which means there must be valid reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p>Throughout his seven year career, Butler has worked tirelessly to put himself in the conversation of the best players in the league. After four straight years of not only being a lockdown defender but also averaging over 20 points per game, it seemed only fitting that he be offered a hefty contract by the team that had not made the playoffs for 14 years until he had arrived. As contract talks stalled, Butler clearly felt betrayed as he mentioned in an interview with ESPN’s Rachel Nichols.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s about saying we need you. We want you here. We can’t do this without you,”, he explained. “And that was the disconnect all along. You’re saying one thing. I mean I’ve learned enough times in life that saying something is completely different than acting upon it.”</p>\n<p>Although this quote explains his frustration with management, it does not bring to light why he was frustrated with his teammates. Butler would later explain this in the same interview when asked if he felt his teammates did not have winning as their top priority.</p>\n<p>“If your No. 1 priority isn’t winning, and people can tell? That’s the battle,”  he explains. “Now, there’s a problem between people because that guy’s No. 1 priority is winning and that guy’s isn’t. Of course they’re gonna clash, like, ‘I’m doing this for the team. Are you?’ ‘Ehh.’ Exactly. So, that’s where the disconnect is.”</p>\n<p>Before Butler became a Timberwolf, it was very clear that Minnesota was underachieving as they had two number one picks on the same roster, in Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins, yet they could not break into the top eight spots in the Western Conference. Minnesota wanted Butler to change the culture in the locker room to where there was an expectation to win but it seems apparent now that not everyone on the team has bought into that culture.</p>\n<p>The dispute between Butler and the organization does not seem to be coming to an end anytime soon as Butler has made it very clear that he wants to be traded immediately. To some, it may be comprehended as him quitting on the team, but that could not be farther from the truth. If Butler could take the third stringers and beat the starters in a scrimmage during practice, it is apparent that winning is not a top priority for the players on the team.</p>\n<p>With Butler turning 30 this year, his years for competing for championships and continuing to play at a high level are numbered. For him, he simply does not want to waste his best years on a team that does not have the same desire to compete as he does.</p>\n<p>As the Timberwolves face the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night, it will be interesting to see the dynamic between not only Butler and his teammates but also Butler and the coaching staff as well. Perhaps, this lights a fire under his teammates and this becomes the year Minnesota finally lives up to their potential.

This marks the most goals Snyder has had in a season as she broke her previous record of 35 goals from her freshman campaign.</p>\n<p>“She has come a long way,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “Last year she had big shoes to fill as a starting center as a freshman. This year she has become more of a leader in and out of the pool, which has really benefited the team”</p>\n<p>Simmons was all over the pool this year as she ranked in the top five of the conference in steals. With a team-leading 42 steals on the year, she was able to have an impact defensively despite having the primary responsibility of initiating the offense in the front court.</p>\n<p>“She won 89/100 sprints which is incredible,” Kay explained. “She made an impact right away and led the team in steals as well. She did a great job as a freshman and I look forward to seeing what she does in the future.”</p>\n<p>Pipkin had her most efficient season in her Gaucho career as she found the back of the net 44 times, assisted on 35 Santa Barbara goals and ranked among the top three in overall points on the year.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to improve next season, it will be crucial for Pipkin, Snyder and Simmons to continue to elevate their game and learn from their past experiences from this season.</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder also had a tremendous year as she had 171 saves on the season with a save percentage of 59.</p>\n<p>As the anchor of the Gauchos’ defense, Snyder often frustrated opponents by preventing potential goals from finding the back of the net with the help of her quick reflexes.</p>\n<p>One highlight of the year was in a game vs UC Davis when Snyder threw the ball over Davis’ keeper and into the Aggies’ goal from her own goal.</p>\n<p>“Goalkeepers are the most important position in polo in my opinion,” Kay stated. “She did a good job and the future is definitely bright. With two years under her belt, I expect her to really rise to the occasion.”</p>\n<p>With everyone returning except senior defender Annie Mortimer, Santa Barbara will look to build on the chemistry they have already developed this year and perfect their craft for next season.</p>\n<p>“I expect us to pick up right where we left off,” Kay explained. “I think it is important that we reflect during this offseason on the things we did well and improve on them. At this point, I don’t think we need to change anything dramatically but instead just need to get better at what we are doing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to develop over this offseason as they aim to climb to the top of the Big West next season with a more experienced group that will use this past season as motivation to elevate their level of play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82856\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82856\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/","id":4870,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4869,4868,4867],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/32"}},"__N_SSG":true}
