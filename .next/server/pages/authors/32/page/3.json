Both senior utility Virginia Smith and senior center Alexandra Massier tallied hat tricks in the contest but the 49ers could not hold off the red-hot Anteater offense.</p>\n<p>Massier leads the way for Long Beach State with 35 goals on the year while junior attacker Tori Morrissey has 10 assists on the year to lead the team.</p>\n<p>The teams have met twice this year with the ’Chos winning the first matchup in early February by five goals while the 49ers claimed the second matchup by one goal in March to start conference play.</p>\n<p>It will be crucial for the Gauchos to continue their defensive success in order get past the 49ers, starting with the play of sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder. The Santa Ana native is coming off a contest in which she had 14 saves.</p>\n<p>“There was a moment in the last game where she scored a goal from the cage which does not happen very often,” Head Coach Serela Kay explained postgame. “She stepped up and took a risk and that was definitely a turning point in that game for us. I think she played really well and the whole team felt the energy from that. I am looking forward to her continuing her high level of play.”</p>\n<p>Despite being one of the youngest teams in the conference, Santa Barbara has been able to find success against their top-ranked opponents behind the play of sophomore utility Sarah Snyder, junior utility Kate Pipkin and stud freshman attacker Mollie Simmons.</p>\n<p>“Pip does a good job of being a playmaker,” Kay pointed out. “She is very versatile and has a really high game IQ which is one of the reasons she can fill the role of the playmaker.”</p>\n<p>Snyder finished the regular season with 46 goals, which not only led the team but also ranked fourth in the Big West Conference. Pipkin had 39 goals and 33 assists on the year which gave her a total of 72 points on the year, which ranked fourth in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>“For Sarah, I talked about her being an inspiring player in the past, and I think she is still doing a great job of that,” Kay stated.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to continue to implement their patient play-style in the postseason as it worked extremely well in their last win against the Aggies.</p>\n<p>“I think allowing the game to develop is important,” Coach Kay highlighted. “Sometimes there are teams that if they rush too much, there are more errors on their part which means the other team does not have to necessarily do anything to get those errors to occur. We have focused on that and this team has done a good job of maturing into that.”</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos approach postseason play, they will look to follow the mantra that has led them to their successful season thus far, as they look to bring home a Big West title.</p>\n<p>“Work hard, be resilient and trust the process,” Kay said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play Long Beach State at 12 p.m. this Friday, April 27, at the Anteater Aquatics Complex in Irvine.</p>\n<p>If they win their matchup with the 49ers, they will face No. 5 Hawaii on Saturday at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82725\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82725\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/no-16-ucsb-heads-south-for-conference-tournament-faces-no-17-lbsu-in-1st-round/","id":4875,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4874,4873,4872],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Snyder Sings and Scores: Sarah’s Major Pregame Ritual","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For most athletes, a pregame routine consists of them listening to their favorite music, eating a healthy snack or going over plays that they want to run against their respective opponent.

She is also considered one of the leaders of the team as she brings a gritty attitude and carries a lot of responsibility on the team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With such a hectic schedule consisting of practices, classes, traveling and studying, it is almost impossible to not feel stressed with so many things going on.</p>\n<p>However, for Snyder, singing has allowed her to de-stress ever since her childhood.</p>\n<p>“I was four when I started singing, and my mom kind of forced me into choir,” she said. “It started off as a cool thing where I had friends, and it was something aside from sports that I could do. I love singing because it is a way to add positivity to my life.”</p>\n<p>Although it may seem that singing was always a positive experience for Snyder, this was not always the case. When she was seven years old, she was told to sing the national anthem at a local swim meet, but in the middle of the song, she forgot some of the words, which led to a very traumatic experience.</p>\n<p>“I was scarred,” she said. “I did not sing for two more years, but I finally had the courage to do it again two years later.”</p>\n<p>It would be reasonable to imagine that she would have had to sacrifice some of her time singing to primarily focus on her water polo career, but that could not be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>“Being a student athlete is definitely time consuming, so I don’t really have much time for other things, but I sing around the house and the pool a lot,” Snyder explained. “I don’t really sacrifice much.”</p>\n<p>The idea of Snyder singing the national anthem before games first came about when Head Coach Serela Kay asked her to sing the piece on Senior Day of the 2017 season.<br>\nWith the whole team on board with the decision, Snyder decided that she would give it a shot despite being extremely nervous that she would make a mistake.</p>\n<p>“My nerves are already up before games and my adrenaline is going,” Snyder explained. “My heart is racing and adding singing to that is very difficult. I was like, I got to do it for the seniors and then it just turned into something after that.”</p>\n<p>When asked whether she had to audition for Coach Kay, Snyder chuckled and explained how she was asked to perform. She would also go on to advocate for freshman Sami Stebbins joining her in the near future.</p>\n<p>“Sami Stebbins is pretty good,” she explained. “She is really good actually. When I leave, she will probably carry the torch.”</p>\n<p>For Snyder, there will never be any singing competitions between her and her teammates because they all have talented voices. Instead, her idea is that the best singers on the team should sing the national anthem together rather than one person having the spotlight.</p>\n<p>“No competitions,” Snyder explained. “I think Sami has a great voice. I would love for her to sing with me. Pip also has a great voice and can play the guitar. Emily can sing also. We should do it all together but definitely no competition.”</p>\n<p>Despite the stress that comes with singing before games, Snyder has been able to limit it through a mantra that she has recently started to follow profusely.</p>\n<p>“Singing probably makes me more tense before games, but a little mantra that I have been sticking with is that failure doesn’t exist and carries over into every aspect in my life,” Snyder said. “If you can’t fail, you can’t succeed, and the least I can do is try.”</p>\n<p>When performing in front of her teammates, Snyder has mixed emotions, especially since she is singing in front of the home crowd as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s nerve-wracking but comfortable, I’d say,” Snyder said. “I know they are all supportive even if I forget the words to the national anthem. Nobody will be upset or anything, so I feel very supported. It helps having a very close-knit team so everybody is always there for each other.”</p>\n<p>With the support of her teammates and the home crowd, it makes performing a lot easier as she explains that the applause quells her nerves and strengthens her bond with her teammates.</p>\n<p>She often finds herself listening to alternative rock in her free time, as it sets her into a positive mood as she goes through her hectic schedule.</p>\n<p>“I love so much music,” Snyder said. “I actually started with classic rock because my dad used to play it all the time. My favorite artists are probably bands nobody has ever heard of. I like Arctic Monkeys and Parachute in particular. When songs like “More Than A Feeling” by Boston come on, I am definitely blasting it in my car.”</p>\n<p>Despite being such a talented singer, her primary focus is on water polo and her education, as well as finding the perfect balance between the two.</p>\n<p>“As of right now, water polo and school is the most important thing right now,” Snyder said. “If I could become a pop star, that would be awesome, but it is not in the cards right now. Or probably ever. It will probably just be my hidden talent, just something fun to do.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West Tournament coming up this weekend, Snyder will look to continue to bring this positive mindset that she has acquired through singing to the team as they look to make some noise in the tournament and win their second Big West Title in the last three years.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on

Sophomore utility Sarah Snyder led the way with four goals while freshman goalkeeper Becca Buck had six saves in front of the cage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In their previous matchup, which dates back to last season, Hawaii won 8-3 behind a high-powered offense that averaged 10 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Hawaii has won six of their last seven games by an average margin of seven goals.</p>\n<p>They last played against No. 14 Long Beach State in their last home game of the season and won by a score of 12-6. Sophomore utility Maartje Keuning led the way as she netted four goals, giving her 36 on the year.</p>\n<p>Junior Irene Gonzales netted a hat trick on the game as well, adding to her team-leading record of 49 goals, which also leads the Big West.</p>\n<p>It will be crucial for the ‘Chos to limit the amount of chances Hawaii has on goal by continuing to stay consistent with their defensive energy throughout the entire game.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii has very good shooters,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “I think they have a lot of fire power so we are going to need to be able to really lock down on defense and get some good shot blocks.”</p>\n<p>As winners of seven of their last 10 games, UC Davis will look to continue their hot streak by relying primarily on their potent offense as they average 11 goals per game on the year.</p>\n<p>The Aggies were last in action this past weekend when they won a thriller against No. 9 UC Irvine. Senior center Greta Kohlmoos had a hat trick on the day while sophomore goalkeeper Caitlin Golding had seven saves.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to have success against UC Davis, it will be crucial for the ‘Chos to slow down junior utility Annie Kutt, who leads the team with 73 points on the year, consisting of 32 goals and 41 assists.</p>\n<p>Despite struggling on offense in the prior two games before CSUN, Santa Barbara seems to have found their rhythm offensively, primarily due to the play of Snyder.</p>\n<p>Snyder comes into this game as the third-leading goal scorer in the conference. With 45 goals on the year, she has already passed last year’s personal scoring record by 10 goals and still has two regular season games as well as the Big West Tournament to add to it.</p>\n<p>“She has been inspiring,” Kay stated. “I think it is important for her to realize that she does lead our team and there is a target on her back, which makes it a little more challenging for herself but that will lead to other people being open.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, freshman attacker Mollie Simmons continues her diverse level of play in terms of goals, sprints and steals. The San Jose native currently has 17 goals and 33 steals on the year and has consistently won sprints to start off the period and give the Gauchos early momentum.</p>\n<p>“She is only a freshman and I think there is such room for growth from her,” Kay said. “I am excited for what is going to come in the future.”</p>\n<p>Both Buck and sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder continue to split time in front of the cage and will look to continue their dominance as of late. With 10 saves and two steals combined in their last game, they have made it extremely difficult for opponents to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>“I think their presence was good,” Kay said. “They have been communicating very well and that is something we have been focusing on.”</p>\n<p>With just two games remaining before the Big West Tournament, UCSB will look to increase their seed in the Big West Standings as they are currently in fifth place. If they win both games, they will put themselves in a great position to secure at least a top-three seed in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to add on to their one-game win streak as they host both Hawaii and Davis this weekend in Santa Barbara at 12 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April

The attacker has done a great job of sharing the ball as well, notching 30 assists, which puts her in the top five in the conference. Van Vugt has been one of the best goalkeepers in the conference so far, actually leading the Big West in saves with 163.</p>\n<p>The Matadors are fresh off a heartbreaking loss against No. 14 Long Beach State where they lost in overtime by a score of 10-8. Senior attacker Katelyn Fairchild netted a hat trick, giving her 42 goals on the year while Vugt had 14 saves on the day.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be looking to overcome the offensive struggles they’ve dealt with over the last two games. They have scored an average of just two goals per contest, far below their season average of nine.</p>\n<p>In order to regain their momentum, the Gauchos will depend on utility players Kate Pipkin and Snyder to create more opportunities to score, whether it be for their teammates or for themselves.</p>\n<p>Pipkin in particular has had a knack for setting up her teammates with opportunities to find the back of the net. She currently leads the team with 29 assists and is on pace for the best offensive season of her UCSB career.</p>\n<p>“She is definitely someone on our team, whether she is scoring or assisting the ball, that has a hand on every play,” Head Coach Serela Kay said.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s current losing streak, the ‘Chos continue to maintain a positive attitude with just three games remaining before the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>“This is always an exciting time because it is the finale,” Kay explained. “For us, we have to just play and realize that this is the end of the process. Now, it’s time to play and execute.”</p>\n<p>One bright spot so far for the Gauchos has been the play of freshman goalkeeper Becca Buck and sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who have shared time in front of the cage for the past three games.</p>\n<p>The dynamic duo has averaged 11 saves per game together and will look to continue their success this weekend.</p>\n<p>“They have both been doing a nice job,” Kay stated. “Kenzi Snyder has started every game for us and sets the tone and Becca Buck, as a freshman, has done a nice job of settling in as well.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to take advantage of three straight home games, which they hope will lift their level of play.</p>\n<p>“We love playing at home,” Kay said. “The community comes out and supports us really well. I know the team will really feel that energy and rally around that.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to get back on track this weekend in Santa Barbara on April 7 as they face a red-hot Matador squad at 12 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 5th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82211\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/gauchos-continue-search-for-1st-conference-win-host-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82211\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/gauchos-continue-search-for-1st-conference-win-host-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/gauchos-continue-search-for-1st-conference-win-host-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/gauchos-continue-search-for-1st-conference-win-host-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/gauchos-continue-search-for-1st-conference-win-host-csun/","id":4899,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4898,4897,4896],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 17 UCSB Splits Final Two Matches of the Regular Season, Awaits Final Seeding For Conf.

On the ‘Chos second possession of the game, sophomore utility Sarah Snyder was able to find the back of the net to give UCSB an early 1-0 lead over the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>Less than 30 seconds later, Hawaii would respond with a goal from Junior utility Femke Aan, giving her 34 goals on the year to knot the game up at 1-1.</p>\n<p>With momentum on their side, the Rainbow Wahine were able to score another goal as freshman utility Carmen Baringo netted her first of two goals on the day to give Hawaii a 2-1 lead going into the second period.</p>\n<p>Hawaii would dominate the second period as they not only scored three goals but also did not allow UCSB to score a goal in the entire period, which put the halftime score at 5-1 in favor of the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>In the third period, Santa Barbara and Hawaii would both score on two straight possessions each to make things interesting after two goals from Simmons and junior utility Sarah Kreiser for the ‘Chos and two goals for Hawaii from redshirt senior utility Chloe Barr to put the game at 7-3. Barr would score another goal later in the period, giving her five goals on the match and 42 on the year.</p>\n<p>With the score at 9-3 in favor of Hawaii to start the fourth period, UCSB would look to find some offensive rhythm to build upon for their match against the Aggies, just a day later.</p>\n<p>Junior center Emily Martin was able to end the scoring drought for Santa Barbara as she scored with just one minute left in the game. The Rainbow Wahine added two more goals in the period and the game ended with a final score of 11-4.</p>\n<p>Just 24 hours later, the Gauchos were back in the pool as they faced a red-hot Aggies squad, that is currently 18-9 overall on the year, with a 3-2 conference record. This game was the last regular season home game for Santa Barbara which meant that it was the last time senior defender Annie Mortimer would suit up for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Mortimer came into the game with five goals and six assists on the year and looked to get a win in her last home game for the ‘Chos.</p>\n<p>In the first period, sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder would start off strong for Santa Barbara as she had two early saves.</p>\n<p>On a power play with 3:54 remaining in the period, Simmons netted her first goal of the day off of a pass from Mortimer giving UCSB an early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>UC Davis did not have any offensive rhythm in the first period and looked to change that as the second period started. Just a minute into the period, sophomore attacker Kathleen Schafle would tie the game up for the Aggies.</p>\n<p>After a couple of defensive stands from both teams, Kreiser would score for the Gauchos giving them a one-goal advantage. Junior utility Annie Kutt would net her only goal of the game for UC Davis to lock things up at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder would later score with two minutes remaining in the second period as she launched a ball over UC Davis’ keeper but once again Schafle would score for the Aggies, putting the score at 3-3 going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Mortimer would start things off in the second half by scoring her first goal of the game which ignited the crowd at the Newport Beach Native was not only able to put a goal away on her senior day but also give Santa Barbara the lead.</p>\n<p>After the game was tied at five goals apiece, Simmons and Sophomore Attacker Natalie Selin would each net goals to give UCSB a 7-5 lead heading into the fourth period.</p>\n<p>Simmons would complete her hat trick in the fourth period off of a great pass from Sarah Snyder on a fast break and after two crucial saves from Kenzi Snyder, Kreiser would put the game away with a goal that put the final score at 9-5.</p>\n<p>Simmons led the way for the ‘Chos as she finished the weekend with four goals, three steals, and one assist.</p>\n<p>Despite not being the biggest in the pool, Simmons continues to find ways to make a positive impact on her team.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I am not a big player,” Simmons stated. “I have to use my mobility and speed to get goals.”</p>\n<p>With this marking Mortimer’s last regular season for the ‘Chos, she ended up finishing in style with one goal and two assists.</p>\n<p>“This is definitely bittersweet,” Mortimer stated. “It feels really good to go out on a win and I think that was one of our best games of the season. We all played really well together and everyone contributed which made it a great game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to continue their momentum from this weekend as they head into the conference tournament in two weeks.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will head to Irvine on April 27th where their opponent has yet to be determined to compete in the Big West Tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82483\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82483\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/","id":5584,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[5583,5582,5581],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 16 Gauchos Open Big West Play With A LBSU Rematch","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2018-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-07-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-07-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With just one match this week, the UCSB women's water polo team prepares for its Big West opener this Saturday.

Sophomore utility Maria Mimidi led the team with a total of six goals in the four games they played in.</p>\n<p>In its last six games, Long Beach State has averaged nine goals per game which means that UCSB must continue to be stout defensively in order to come out with a win.</p>\n<p>UCSB has seemed to have found their rhythm offensively after scoring a total of 27 goals in their past two games.</p>\n<p>“I think we are starting to gel a little bit better,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “It is an area that we need to keep improving on, which just comes with time.”</p>\n<p>After struggling at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational in Irvine, the ’Chos were able to regain their confidence with two wins this past weekend.</p>\n<p>“Part of the process is adversity and rebounding after losses,” Kay said. “If you continue to get hit, it definitely breaks you down, so it was nice to come out with two wins.”<br>\nJunior utility Kate Pipkin in particular has been on a hot streak, as she netted five goals and assisted on four this past weekend at the Claremont Convergence Tournament.</p>\n<p>For the season, Pipkin has 32 goals and a team-leading 27 assists and 59 total points accumulated.</p>\n<p>“She can do a little bit of everything,” Kay said. “It just depends on who we are playing. She is a very powerful threat. When she is on, watch out.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will also hope to rely on sophomore attacker Natalie Selin, whose five goals and four steal performance at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational led to her being picked as the Big West Player of the Week on Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>After netting four more goals this past weekend, Selin, the California native, has tallied 24 goals on the season.</p>\n<p>Moreover, freshman goalkeeper Becca Buck and sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder have started to dominate as Buck recorded 12 saves against the University of Redlands and Snyder recorded 10 saves against Pomona-Pitzer.</p>\n<p>“They have done a great job,” Kay said. “The goalies have been splitting time so Becca played the first game that day and Kenzie Snyder played the second game against Pomona. I am really proud of both of them and excited about the future.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to add on to their win streak this weekend at Long Beach on March 10 as they face a red-hot 49er squad at 12 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 8</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81838\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/no-16-gauchos-open-big-west-play-with-a-lbsu-rematch/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81838\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/no-16-gauchos-open-big-west-play-with-a-lbsu-rematch/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/no-16-gauchos-open-big-west-play-with-a-lbsu-rematch/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/no-16-gauchos-open-big-west-play-with-a-lbsu-rematch/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/no-16-gauchos-open-big-west-play-with-a-lbsu-rematch/","id":4898,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4897,4896,4895],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Score a Combined 27 Goals in Pair of Weekend Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2018-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB ended its two-match slump with consecutive wins over the weekend.

Sophomore Attacker Courtney Gray was able to convert at the three minute mark in the third period while Junior Center Kolby Kahahawai was able to score at the six minute mark in the fourth period.</p>\n<p>UCSB won the game by a final score of 19-2 behind an impressive defensive performance. Despite the Bulldogs having 24 shots on goal, they were only able to beat Freshman Goalkeeper Becca Buck twice.</p>\n<p>Later that afternoon, Santa Barbara played against the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens who came into the game with an overall record of 6-4 after dropping a game earlier in the day to Cal Baptist.</p>\n<p>The two teams last met at the Winter Invitational in Santa Barbara last year, where the Gauchos dominated and won the game with a final a score of 15-5.</p>\n<p>Both teams started the first period red hot offensively with the Gauchos taking an early 3-2 lead behind Sophomore Utility Sarah Snyder netting a goal as well as assisting on Sophomore Utility Kate Coski’s goal.</p>\n<p>The momentum quickly swung in Santa Barbara’s favor in the second period with the ‘Chos tallying up two more goals while keeping the Sagehens off the board to complete the first half with a 5-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Sagehens started to find their rhythm in the third period as they found the back of the net three times, with two of them coming from their star player Senior Attacker Morgan McCracken. UCSB’s Pipkin was able to convert on a goal in the middle of the Sagehens’ rally off of an assist from Selin.  Although Santa Barbara gave up three goals in the third period, they still had a 6-5 lead heading into the fourth period.</p>\n<p>In dramatic fashion, McCracken was able to score the only goal between both teams in the fourth period to send the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>Pomona-Pitzer’s’ Junior Utility Nohea Kahaulelio started the first overtime period with a goal at the two minute mark but Santa Barbara’s Junior Utility Sarah Kreiser responded to knot the game up at 7-7 with only one minute left in the second overtime.</p>\n<p>This set the stage for the sudden death period where the next team to score would win the match. With two seconds left in the period, Pipkin was able to find the back of the net, handing the Gauchos an 8-7 win.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to continue their two game winning streak next weekend as they head to Long Beach to take on Long Beach State at 12 p.m. on Saturday March 10th.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81841\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-score-a-combined-27-goals-in-pair-of-weekend-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81841\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-score-a-combined-27-goals-in-pair-of-weekend-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-score-a-combined-27-goals-in-pair-of-weekend-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-score-a-combined-27-goals-in-pair-of-weekend-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-score-a-combined-27-goals-in-pair-of-weekend-wins/","id":4897,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4896,4895,4894],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Continues Non-Conf.

She creates tempo in transition and moves a lot in the front court.”</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB is currently on a two game losing streak, the young Gauchos’ are still confident that they can get back on track.</p>\n<p>“Our confidence is good,” Kay explained. “It is important that we understand we are right in the middle of this season. Patience and really focusing on the little things is what is going to be important at this moment.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has played a total of 18 games this season, with many of those matches going against schools that are ranked in the top 10 in the country.</p>\n<p>“It helps us grow as a team,” Selin stated. “Everything at this point is meant to help further develop us as a team.”</p>\n<p>Santa

The teams had met previously this year with the Wolverines winning by a score of 10-7.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos led 4-3 early in the final period but the Wolverines would go on a 4-0 run to help put the game out of reach.</p>\n<p>The final score of the game made the score 7-5, with junior Kate Pipkin scoring a late goal with four seconds left.</p>\n<p>Pipkin led the team with three goals while sophomore attacker Sarah Snyder and junior utility Sarah Kreiser scored a goal each.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would finish the tournament with a morning game on Sunday where they faced Loyola Marymount University. The two teams had met previously this year in a nail biter where the Lions escaped with a 7-6 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite a quick start out of the gates from the Gauchos with two early goals from Selin and freshman attacker Mollie Simmons, LMU went on a 4-0 run between the end of the first period to the end of the third period.</p>\n<p>Snyder was able to find the back of the net with a little over three minutes left to make it a one goal game but the team was unable to complete the comeback with such little time remaining.</p>\n<p>LMU won the close match 4-3 and was led by Morgan Molloy who scored two goals and eight key saves from goalkeeper Claire Wright.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to get back on track as they play two games against Redlands and Pomona-Pitzer at the Claremont Convergence Tournament on Saturday, March 3rd.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

ago.</p>\n<p>The Bruins bounced back with a win against No. 7 UC Irvine but again showed glimpses of a team that could be beat as they only just pulled away from the Anteaters with an 8-7 victory in double overtime. It was their first overtime win of the year.</p>\n<p>Sophomore attacker Maddie Musselman scored the game winner with 1:42 remaining to stun the Anteaters. She leads UCLA with 24 goals and 16 assists.</p>\n<p>Despite a solid performance by its cohort of utilities – a scoring hat trick and two assists from junior Kate Pipkin, two goals from junior Sarah Kreiser and a goal from freshman Amelia Meckelborg – UCSB was unable to keep UCLA from finding the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The 10 goals allowed tied the most given up by UCSB this season.</p>\n<p>A total of 10 games have taken place since this first meeting with UCLA, and improvements on defense have definitely been made. UCSB has given up just an average of four goals during that 10-match stretch.</p>\n<p>“We focus on defense,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “Defense wins championships, and that’s what fuels the counterattack in transition and into the frontcourt. Keeping teams under eight is always our goal.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos head into this game with a one-game losing streak after a devastating 7-6 loss to Loyola Marymount on Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>With a 6-6 tie going into the fourth period, the Lions’ Katie Hungerford was able to convert on a late goal with three minutes left to seal the victory. The narrow loss snapped a two-game winning streak for the Gauchos, where they scored 20 goals and only gave up nine goals between both games.</p>\n<p>In order for the Gauchos to come out with a win this Friday, it will be crucial to limit the high-powered Bruin offense.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s sophomore utility Sarah Snyder comes into this game with 30 goals, leading not only the team but also the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>“Snyder fills the role of not only a center, but she also plays on the perimeter,” Kay said. “I think that has freed her up a little bit, which has been a very positive thing.”</p>\n<p>Contributing to the scoring process are players like Pipkin, who leads both the Gauchos and Big West with 21 assists and 45 points.</p>\n<p>“Pip has a very high game IQ,” Kay explained. “It’s obvious in her points, leading in assists and then being high up there in goals scored. She plays a huge part on the mental aspect of the game, making sure that she is the glue that keeps everyone together.”</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos approach conference play, they will look to follow the mantra that has led them to their early success thus far this season.</p>\n<p>“Work hard, be resilient and trust the process,” Kay said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play UCLA at 1:45 p.m. this Friday, Feb. 23, at the Anteater Aquatics Complex in Irvine. UCSB will also compete two more times after their matchup with the Bruins where wins and losses will predict what future teams they’ll face during the weekend.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 22</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81400\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/womens-water-polo-heads-to-irvine-for-uci-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81400\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/womens-water-polo-heads-to-irvine-for-uci-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/womens-water-polo-heads-to-irvine-for-uci-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/womens-water-polo-heads-to-irvine-for-uci-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/womens-water-polo-heads-to-irvine-for-uci-invitational/","id":4894,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[4893,4892,4891],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/32"}},"__N_SSG":true}
