These allegations, if true, are not only wildly unhelpful and disrespectful to those who choose to report these violent crimes, but they contribute to the toxic rape culture oozing at the seams of our community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately one in five women and one in 16 men </span><a href=\"https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will be sexually assaulted in college</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Only around 10% of survivors report their assaults to law enforcement. This is due to a number of reasons, including fear of retaliation by the perpetrator/associates/friends and the hesitation to put oneself through the physically and emotionally invasive process of reporting. Now the despicable allegations against the community’s own police force is another contributing factor that survivors must consider before choosing to report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sexual assault is a crime based on power dynamics. As an inherently powerful figment in the community, the UCPD is exacerbating that power imbalance by allegedly exploiting people who have been physically, mentally and emotionally violated. They have allegedly abused their power to prey on and mock people who have sought their aid, people who are hopeful that their power can help serve justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These allegations against officers in our own community are exponentially detrimental to the relationship that the police will have with UCSB students and I.V. residents in the months and years to come. The damage is done; the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-03/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-calling-for-disarmament-of-campus-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inherent community distrust of the police</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is only heightened by these claims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a society plagued with </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/20-25-reported-rapes-in-isla-vista-over-3-year-period-csd-report-finds/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">looming statistics of sexual violence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our police should be beacons of support and justice. Instead they allegedly mock victims of assault, joking about the immense suffering and trauma that they endure. These alleged actions minimize and invalidate the experiences of survivors and, in turn, create a toxic environment that discourages reporting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College communities are particularly privy to sexual assault, and if these allegations are true, it is impossible to quantify the number of people that the UCPD has hurt over the years with their callous mockery of people who are courageous enough to come to them seeking help.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These allegations, if true, are not only wildly unhelpful and disrespectful to those who choose to report these violent crimes, but they contribute to the toxic rape culture oozing at the seams of our community.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are not the only people who are left feeling as though they had nowhere to turn (if they even still considered the police worth going to for help). The officers named in the lawsuit also allegedly made derogatory comments against people of color (including students and faculty). Officer Michael Little allegedly spoke of a fantasy in which a Black man attempts to rob him: “Little would then mimic responding by stating, ‘How about I shoot you in the fucking face!’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I passed by the department after the article’s publication I was left with chills down my spine and goosebumps on my arms. When we hear horrific stories of insidious actions carried out by cops, it often feels removed, if we are lucky enough to have that privilege. But now, face to face with the police building, if true, it is disturbing to realize what inexcusable behavior allegedly took place inside its unassuming walls. It is disturbing to realize how many people we know were hurt by the reported comments, stereotyping and mockery made behind those doors. These are the cops we see out on the streets at night after parties. We </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-11/not-your-exotic-babe-navigating-i-v-as-ethnically-ambiguous/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">say nothing when they hit on us</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or when they give us trouble because we know better than to pick a fight with a police officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some cops in the community seem like they try to relate to the younger-skewing demographic of the I.V. community. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itself even had a column from as recent as late 2015 run by </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/category/question-authority-opinion/?fbclid=IwAR3qwzs0f31uJvbwKBJh7RW0vsnTX4tH7zqwMBDY8taPJU6PW0-Yqu1T5kM\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Mark Signa</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits against UCPD and frequently negatively mentioned in another. Even if Lt. Signa is unfairly portrayed in these allegations, the alleged “Good Ole Boys’ Club” fostered within the UCPD seems to have contributed heavily to the normalization of this culture of toxicity that has run rampant in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if these cases don’t hold up in court, the reputation of the UCSB UCPD could be irreparably damaged; there’s a chance the community will never look at the UCPD in the same way again. I find it deeply ironic that the department, which has recently contributed to a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/i-v-and-santa-barbara-groups-address-sexual-violence-in-video-series/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series of videos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> extolling sentiments of belief and support for survivors, is facing such disturbing allegations regarding the dehumanization of victims of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if these cases don’t hold up in court, these allegations will likely be widely believed by the community. The department should not have tried to bury these allegations that go back several years; instead, they should have made a statement in an effort of transparency. These allegations never would have seen the light of day had members of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not physically gone through court records to find them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These allegations and the effort to hide them from the public eye will alter the UCPD’s relationship with the community for years — if not decades — to come, and that will hurt the students above anyone else.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anonymous thinks that UCSB students deserve a police force that does not diminish the experiences of vulnerable and marginalized communities.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-consequences-of-the-ucpd-allegations/","id":5636,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[5635,5634,5633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Overheard in Isla Vista","category":"Nexustentialism","subcategory":"Nexustentialism","publish_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Hello boys and girls, welcome back to the first week of 2015.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Hello boys and girls, welcome back to the first week of 2015.

Turns out my man farted, and the scent of his deadly sin wafts up into the air and sears my nostrils. God. I can tell you that right then and there, my pussy went from a wet oasis to a dried out desert.</p>\n<p>The lights are off, the ambience steamy and sensual. We’re makin’ love missionary, and he’s in a generous mood so he says, “Let me eat you out, baby. Come on, let me do it.” He pulls out and starts to finger me, huskily continuing to offer his oral services. To accentuate his point, he takes his finger out and teases, “I can taste you like this by licking my finger, but I’d rather use my tongue to play with your clit.” I egg him on, so he sticks his finger in his mouth and does one taste — suddenly his face contorts and he looks like he’s about to gag. Yea, what can I say? A period hits when a period hits.</p>\n<p>One time, I was over at my then-boyfriend’s hometown dwelling. We thought nobody was going to be home for at least two hours, so we started going at it with enthusiasm. However, we did not hear the door knob jiggle, and lo and behold, his parents caught us tangled up naked in the sheets.

Just shitloads of queefing.</p>\n<p>During my senior year of high school, I ran into this guy at church, after not seeing him since middle school. We started texting regularly and I was really attracted his “badass” hair and snakebites, for reasons I do not know. I ended up going to his house after school one day to hook up. I wasn’t down to have sex, so he put in “Avatar” and I gave him a blow job. His mom got home after that and he didn’t want to risk getting caught, so he seriously made me climb out of his bedroom window (which was on the second floor). After getting out of the window and climbing on to the ledge above the garage, I discovered how high up I actually was, and being only five feet tall, I definitely freaked out a little. I do not know how I actually succeeded getting back on the ground, but I scratched up my hands pretty badly on the way and never talked to him again. I have not been able to watch “Avatar” since.</p>\n<p>This guy I had a fling with freshman and sophomore year came by one night. I had a twin-sized bunk bed that was dangerously close to the ceiling and even more dangerously squeaky — not an ideal hook-up spot in a house with thin walls and a lot of housemates. Next to the lofted squeak was my desk chair, a little wooden seat that I had studied in since my preteen years. Despite its nearly antique build, we decided to get bare on my chair. He sat down facing me, and I eased down on top of him to sit facing him. The second we started thrusting, however, one of the legs on the chair popped out from under us and we went toppling over, hitting the ground hard and laughing even harder. We ended up just going at it on the floor and he even screwed the chair leg back into its nook after he finished screwing a different nook. The chair is still standing to this day, but it hasn’t seen any action since that night.</p>\n<p>I felt pretty bad about sexiling this guy’s roommate … until I woke up the next morning to him … in his bed across the room … staring directly into my eyes. Unsettling, to say the least.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I thought it would be romantic to take a bath together. We had the bubbles, candles and steamy water drawn and the mood was set. We stripped down and he slipped into the tub first. I slinked over and put my feet on either side of his reclined body, facing toward him and away from the shower head and bath faucet. As I tried to sexily dip down on top of him and was nearly in a squat position, I saw a smirk cross his face and felt a cold, sharp pang in my butt, sending me leaping up in cries and screams. The bath faucet knob had oh-so-perfectly aligned itself to nearly pop my anal virginity, and my boyfriend — who didn’t warn me in the seconds before it happened — thought it was hilarious. Needless to say, he bathed alone that night.</p>\n<p>My life is a sex blooper…</p>\n<p>I had been hooking up with this girl, and we went around back at this party so we could have a bit of fun. She started giving me a handjob and, suffice to say, the pain was excruciating. So bad, in fact that I had to break things off with her later that night… I don’t really feel all that bad about it, though, because now she’s a model and significantly more attractive than me.</p>\n<p>A couple months ago, while engaging in vigorous coitus with my femme fatale, I was struck with the sudden, insatiable desire to finger m’girl’s pooper. Being the suave gentleman that I am I couldn’t just shove it in of course, so I set about caressing the back of her thigh with my index finger and going in for the kill several moments before she climaxed. Upon entering her I was immediately greeted with the stench and texture of human shit. Unsuprising, if you take a moment to think about it. But what happened next was almost indescribable. Instead of plugging the proverbial leak in the dyke (no pun intended), my anal expedition managed to be the straw that broke the camel’s back and from her poured a massive, massive shit that covered my whole arm. Screaming wildly, I disentangled myself from her and the mountain of feces and ran into the bathroom to flush my arm in the toilet while my femme fatale just sat there screaming. Now every time I have the sex (we have since separated), I get the smallest whiff of flatulence and the fucking is such stanky sorrow.</p>\n<p>The day after I broke up with my ex, we met up for “closure” a.k.a. break-up sex. Distracted by the situation at hand, I ignored my phone for several hours. My nosy best friend, worried about my emotional state post-breakup, went looking for me everywhere — including my ex’s apartment. She walked in on us mid-act. Busted. Always make sure you lock the doors before you have secret sex with an ex.</p>\n<p>The last girl I was with thought that I was really into having my earlobes sucked, so one night she gave me the “special treatment” and went at it for well over 20 minutes. It started to hurt after about the first five, but she just kept right on going, sucking harder and harder. I just didn’t have the heart to tell her that my earlobes were about one suck away from exploding. The next day they swelled up to about double their original size and, after a couple of days, they started peeling because they had been so inflated.</p>\n<p>I woke up one morning after a friend’s party to this girl who I had hooked up with a couple times grinding on me. She had a boyfriend and we had extensively discussed that we could not hook up anymore so long as she was taken, but she felt that grinding her vag on me was A-Ok, as long as she didn’t kiss me. I pretended to be asleep throughout pretty much the whole thing, so I basically laid there with a boner (I’m only human) pretending to be unresponsive for at least 15 minutes while she just went at it. I still don’t know if she thought I was actually asleep or just so overcome with bliss that I couldn’t even open my eyes.</p>\n<p>I was in a photobooth with some girl at a party and we started to get into it when another girl came up and opened the curtain. Apparently the girl I was with had a problem with this other girl, because she immediately punched her out and casually sat back down. I have never been more terrified to hook up with anybody, but what choice did I have? The girl had a mean right hook…</p>\n<p><em>This is a collection of anonymous stories.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, April 16, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

We have relinquished many of the things that we treasured and have allowed for the constant infringement upon our various rights and the self-proclaimed “right to party.” But, there is a threshold. Do not forget the student activism that has taken place within this community over the course of its inception.</p>\n<p>I, as the author of this letter, encourage Isla Vista Residents to remain steadfast in your commitment to express yourselves in however you deem sufficient, whilst upholding appropriate safety precautions that are needed to ensure the wellbeing of others. Furthermore, the “out-of-towners” that are negatively spoken of during conversations regarding Isla Vista are invited by us into our community. Because of this, we need to exercise greater influence on who we solicit to come to I.V. or at the very least, what we allow them to do while they are here. They will eventually leave, but it is the Isla Vista community that ultimately pays the price for their actions, largely by way of the police exercising militant force.</p>\n<p>Deltopia does not have an official day (unlike Halloween); it is not set in stone. Because of this, students should think of creative ways to out-maneuver law enforcement in this game of cat and mouse. If Deltopia gets ruined this weekend then have it again the following weekend, or better yet, have Floatopia. I assure you, the urge to rage will long outlast the budget of Santa Barbara to keep sending in large numbers of police. It should be noted that 85 percent of complaints received about noise, music and disturbing the peace are called in by law enforcement themselves, in order to “justify” the dissolution of social gatherings in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>They treat the UC students as if they didn’t have to work hard to get here, and they treat the CC students like they’ll never amount to anything of substance. Contrarily, SBCC and UCSB are beacons of the educational process in their own respects. We work very hard and deserve the freedom to relieve stress in a celebratory manner with likeminded individuals. COME ON I.V.! We pay tens of thousands of dollars to sit in overcrowded classrooms, pay overpriced rent, get harassed by law enforcement and have the various administrations and authoritative bodies bully and patronize us. Do not let this community turn into a police state. They can do only to us what we let them do.</p>\n<p>To the Administrations of UCSB and SBCC, Isla Vista Foot Patrol and all other entities invested in the suppression of social gatherings within Isla Vista:</p>\n<p>I am pleading with you, as the author of this letter, to not underestimate the efficacy and resolve of the 20-30 thousand students residing in Isla Vista. Everyone agrees that we would like Isla Vista to be safe. However, we will not allow it to be a pyrrhic victory. When UCSB and SBCC want to coax us into acquiescing to their interests then they leverage every resource and network to reach us. Yet, when there are meetings, votes and changes to the laws that govern our day to day lives, we are kept in the dark and silenced.</p>\n<p>The young adults that live in Isla Vista do not wish to be governed in a way that lightly channels neo-fascism. We have some of the brightest minds in the country within our zip code, why not try to work with us rather than against us? After the burning down of Embarcadero Hall (formerly known as Bank of America), thousands of incidents of police brutality and the tensions between residents and enforcers, you should welcome the idea. Holding open office hours (IVPD) only works for people who have an ideology that is in line with that of the policing authority in I.V. Dissenters have been arrested, brutally beaten and even slaughtered (R.I.P. Kevin Moran). So I’m certain you understand our reluctance to trust you, although we would like to. There should be greater dialogue between those that would like to take away the social aspect of Isla Vista altogether and those that wish to preserve it. Deltopia is more than just college kids partying; Deltopia is ONE DAY that signifies the final stretch of a hard years work through the expression of dance and the amplification of community. Imposing stricter noise ordinances to virtually not allow any music is very heavy handed.</p>\n<p>The I.V. community should not resent the presence of law enforcement, however, we are left with no choice. College, in an abstract sense, is supposed to support the varied manifestations of expression, not the preclusion of it. We would gladly like to work with the enforcement arms of the UC System, such as IVFP and UCPD to establish some middle ground with regards to Deltopia, Halloween and the social scene in its entirety. We are entitled to seats at the table, especially when the discussions directly affect us. Yet, it would seem that you are more invested in the abuse of college kids in the name of safety, than working with us educated students on effective safety measures that we do not have to side step.</p>\n<p>TO ALL WHO HAVE READ THUS FAR:</p>\n<p>This is a letter not only in defense of Deltopia, but also in the defense of preserving a social scene that has evolved over the years. This is a letter encouraging students to critically think about what they are willing to relinquish and what they are willing to fight for. Partying may be the focus of this letter at its face, but partying is not the focus of this letter in terms of its content. Think of what we pay, what we receive and what we are entitled to. Likewise, to those lobbied against the students, you should definitively decide how much animosity, brutality and prejudice you are going to harbor and exert on the students who call this place home.</p>\n<p><em>This is an open letter from an author named “Isla Vista.”</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, April 3, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

It doesn’t leave anyone behind, and it certainly doesn’t make any woman feel worse about who she is, what she has experienced or what she desires to experience. It doesn’t marginalize. I am just five weeks into an introductory Women’s Studies course at a community college — a watered-down, slowed-down, truly basic course where we haven’t learned much at all — yet we have learned at least that much. It’s an elementary fact.</p>\n<p>Yet, many of the ideas I hear labeled as “feminist” in contemporary discourse are not inclusive at all. The most aggressive of these misled, modern manifestations of feminism — at least in my experience — is sex positivity.</p>\n<p>My understanding of the sex-positive movement, in its ideal form, is that it aims to end all negative perceptions of sexuality — to end slut shaming, kink shaming and the Madonna-whore complex. It aims to educate and to spread awareness of the female anatomy and understanding of the female orgasm. I don’t disagree with any of these goals; I disagree with the way sex positivity has trickled down — the way I hear it expressed by real people in real conversations.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I have been told by sex-positive “feminists” that the solution to any problem, or to any anxiety, is casual sex. I have heard physical arousal prioritized over emotional connection and trust so many times that it makes me nauseous. No, I’m not repulsed by your enjoyment of casual sex; I’m actually very happy for you. I’m repulsed when you tell me how I should feel about sex —that my aversion to it is irrational, that my desire for a deeper connection is silly. Don’t ever tell anyone that his or her very real, very legitimate feelings about sex are silly. You have no idea what that person has been through.</p>\n<p>The sex-positive movement is the most marginalizing force I have ever experienced. Now, that says a lot about my privilege. I’m white, cisgender, middle class … and I don’t label my sexual orientation, but I can sure as hell pass for straight. I had a decent lot in life, until I attended UCSB and accumulated a number of experiences with physical, psychological and sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>The sex-positive movement didn’t cause those experiences — misogyny and rape culture did. But as a survivor of all of that, I find that the way that sex positive “feminists” treat me is incredibly problematic.</p>\n<p>I identify as a survivor of sexual assault. I identify with a number of the mental disorders that accompany such survival. I identify as the girl hitting her head against the drinking fountain outside, trying to stop the flashbacks that were triggered when a sex-positive “feminist” made the (perhaps unconscious) decision that her right to express sexual freedom superseded the right of others to feel safe.</p>\n<p>Hyper-sexualized language is triggering. Aggressive sexual imagery is triggering. A fellow student once opened a porn gif on his phone and held it in front of my face, in a situation where I physically could not walk away from it. I don’t know if that was micro or overt, but it was passed over as sex positivity, when it was nothing more than marginalizing aggression. And that wasn’t the first or the last time that sex positivity forced me into panic, while its advocates brushed off my feelings and experience with three words: “It’s just sex.”</p>\n<p>I don’t hit my head on drinking fountains at UCSB anymore. I took a leave of absence because the culture made me feel so small. Sex positivity drove me 300 miles away, where I am now five weeks into an introductory Women’s Studies course at a Bay Area community college.</p>\n<p>That’s my story. I won’t tell you any more about it, so as to avoid gross overuse of pathos. You shouldn’t need the full-length tragic account of one survivor in order to sympathize with this issue — it’s much simpler than that.</p>\n<p>The statistics vary, but in one report by the Centers for Disease Control, 20 percent of female college students reported having been raped at some point in their life. Rape is also drastically underreported. That means at least one in five college women are survivors of sexual assault. Most, if not all, of those women have a much more complicated relationship with sex than sex-positive “feminism” is willing to acknowledge.</p>\n<p>Those women matter. Those women are a minority, and they have had their voices taken away in a more profoundly psychological way than any other marginalized group. Those women deserve to feel safe, to not be triggered everywhere they go. They deserve to rediscover and redefine sexuality on their own terms, in their own time.</p>\n<p>I’m sure that all the self-identifying sex-positive “feminists” reading this article have been offended every time I put “feminist” in quotes, but that’s the point I’m trying to make. Sex positivity is a movement with many admirable goals, but the reality of it has stretched into something that marginalizes survivors, asexuals and anyone for whom sex is more complicated than simple consent and the distribution of orgasms. When a movement begins to marginalize, it ceases to be feminism.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying that sex positivity needs to end — I’m saying it needs to change. It needs to acknowledge the complex relationships women have with sex. It needs to acknowledge survivors.</p>\n<p>I recently attended UC Berkeley’s production of “The Vagina Monologues,” which celebrates female sexuality, but places equal emphasis on the reality of sexual assault. At the end of the show, the emcees asked audience members to stand or otherwise indicate if they indentified as survivors. I experienced a small convulsion, as my immediate response was to stand, but when no one else stood, I felt a flash of the shame that had plagued the past year of my life. Then, as I sat there mortified with my knees locked, I saw a hand go up. Slowly, across the room, women began to raise their hands, and I raised mine as well. None of us had the courage to stand, but we were all there, and we were not few.</p>\n<p>In my experience, survivors are the quietest people you will ever meet. They have been made to feel small through many aspects of our culture, with sex positivity being just one of the drops in an ocean of oppression. But if you give them a chance — if you let them feel safe — the survivors have absolutely the most important things to say.</p>\n<p><em>The author of this piece wishes to remain anonymous.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, February 20, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Having smaller labia is just as normal as having bigger ones.</p>\n<p>You might be familiar with stories about how those with body issues came to be that way. About how they thought they were perfectly normal, until one day, someone made a comment to tell them they aren’t. And so begins a spiral of self-consciousness and body image issues.</p>\n<p>You see, I thought I was totally normal. That is, until I started reading literature written by people attempting to eliminate the ideal of the small labia who, in the process, painted those labia as unnatural. There seems to be a tendency that attempts to boost a group that is marginalized by putting down the rest of us who happened to not be a part of that group.</p>\n<p>Anything someone is born with is “normal”: Small labia, large labia — whatever the case may be. If you want to change that, that’s your prerogative. If you need to change it for medical reasons, by all means do it. But you shouldn’t be SHAMED into changing it, or into NOT changing it.</p>\n<p>Whatever we are born with is something to be proud of, not ashamed of.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article was submitted anonymously.</em></p>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

We began talking about the dating culture at each of our relative schools. He was looking for advice on how he was going to ask out a girl with whom he had been hooking up for three weeks. He wanted her for himself. He said he was going to take her out to a really nice, elaborate dinner. Then he asked, “Do you think I should ask her to be my girlfriend before, during or after the dinner?” I respond, “During.” But hell, what do I know? It’s not like I’ve ever been taken on a candlelit dinner throughout my three years in college. And neither have any of my five normal roommates.</p>\n<p>Here’s a story for you: It’s about a Boy with blue eyes and a Girl with brown hair. Boy and Girl had been friends for a while. One evening, Girl was hosting a party and Boy arrived. That evening, their friendship surpassed just friendship. Whenever you have sex with a friend for the first time, you move into precarious territory. Anyway, Boy needed to use the restroom in the middle of everything and upon return, decided to use the same condom as before. This was a flagrant turn-off for Girl, so she suggested that they both go to sleep. Three hours later, Girl awakened, turned to her side and noticed that Boy had enigmatically disappeared. “I just wanted to sleep in a bigger bed,” Boy texted her when she inquired where he had gone. Girl knew something was up, because Boy had slept over in her small bed many times before. Morning arrived, night arrived and the following day and week arrived … still no word from Boy.</p>\n<p>This story is just one of many that attest to the presence of letdowns, absences and avoidances that are oftentimes more hurtful than directness, all of which have been felt by a majority of females living in our community. So here’s my advice to you, boys: Try taking her out to dinner before unbuttoning her pants. Try holding her hand before asking for a blowjob.</p>\n<p>Here’s another way to put it: Guys, think of your sister. And if you don’t have a sister, imagine that you do. Would you want some guy treating her the same way you treat the girl you’re kissing?</p>\n<p>Don’t be so afraid that we’re going to shepherd you toward commitment. Our only want is for someone to treat us decently, to stay for the entirety of night when we make the request, to show facets of honesty and to walk us home when it’s dark outside and we were recently informed of a stabbing that took place on the 66 block of DP. After all, our hearts only bend so much.</p>\n<p><em>This article was submitted anonymously.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article appeared online only.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52330\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52330\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/letter-to-the-editor-on-chivalry-and-disappointment/","id":5886,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[5885,5884,5883],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Female and Republican?

One night in a bar, this somehow gave me validity as a Republican. The fact that my ideologies were neither a choice to mime my parent’s party politics, nor the cliché rebellion against everything they stand for, seemed to catch the tipsy brunette off guard. Her cheekbones rose as she squinted her eyes at me. I nearly expected her to cock her head and examine me sideways — how odd that I had chosen to be a Republican.</p>\n<p>Republican minorities are like mystical creatures at UC Santa Barbara. No one really knows they exist and when they’re revealed, well, you should see the disbelievers’ faces. By far the most satisfying part of being a Republican on an excessively liberal campus is shocking the hell out of Democrats. “Wait… you are a college woman… and you want to pay for your own birth control? … But it’s free somewhere else.” True, it is “free” elsewhere. OR I could forgo a single burrito once a month to take responsibility for my own adult actions. Let’s see here, sacrifice two Starbucks coffees every 30 days or have a baby. Decisions, decisions. True, some people genuinely cannot afford it, and for that we have safety nets. But for you in the Lululemon yoga pants and the Tory Burch iPhone case: I think you can manage. And yes I just called out 75 percent of the Communication majors.</p>\n<p>To the reader who clung to the phrase “safety net” just now, I preemptively counter your generalization that all Republicans are against government agencies. That’s actually a staunch Libertarian, by the way. “Common Sense Republicans” make up a majority of the Right, meaning people who believe in limited government but acknowledge the necessity for some government intervention and of course military defense.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Let’s take a minute to think of an alternative universe in which Liberals are the sexist ones. I would have rewritten this argument in my own words, but Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R- TX) just said it so eloquently:</p>\n<p>“To say that there is a set of concerns that can be labeled ‘women’s issues’ is absolutely true. But to assume that we all feel the same way about them — or that we must feel the same way about them to represent our gender legitimately — is inherently sexist. Women are, in fact, more than our gender. We are entrepreneurs and executives who are concerned about a faltering economy and business-unfriendly regulation. We are homemakers and heads of households who worry what tax hikes will do to our family budgets. We are parents who want the best education possible for our children. We are recent graduates, entering the bleakest job market in decades.”</p>\n<p>I’ve had enough of your presumptuous arguments reducing the discussion of women in politics to reproductive “rights,” thus subjugating the current economic crisis as a somehow less important issue for women. To make it clear — as it will soon be evident when we graduate in the next one to three years and have no jobs — an anemic economy hinders the opportunity for women (and ALL Americans) to succeed. So to your “Smart Women Vote Obama” button I say FORGET YOU. Not only would I bet 100 hundred dollars my GPA is higher than yours, but my brain is up by my eyes where I can see over my ovaries to the larger issues ruining this country, like out of control spending. The Left speaks of this “War on Women” like a Republican woman is an oxymoron. Or any minority for that matter. Though not a member of either club, I’d just like to point out that the Campus Democrats’ elected board consists of all white people. The Republicans, by comparison, have representatives in their club who are of African American and Jewish descent.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I happen to believe that saving a little unborn baby is more important than saving a tree, am I now anti-woman? The Left is even satirized for its excessive use of euphemisms and there-there political correctness. This decade’s flavor is “pro-choice” meaning pro-abortion. If you are pro-choice, do you support the choice to own a gun? Do you support the choice to pick what health care provider you want? Answer yes and you can keep the euphemism. Answer no and you’re annoying and a hypocrite.</p>\n<p>RAPID FIRE, GO!</p>\n<p>Stop with the pity party: women are the majority in college enrollment, college graduation, professional occupations and in AP test taking.</p>\n<p>Okay, the binders full of women thing was really funny.</p>\n<p>Maybe I like making sandwiches. Because men can’t do anything right.</p>\n<p>“Women” doesn’t have a “y” in it.</p>\n<p>Dumbledore dies.</p>\n<p><em>This author has requested to remain anonymous so you can’t add the sweet, sweet taste of elephant blood to your coffee.

From fetishism to transgender attraction to polyamorous behavior to non-heterosexuality, non-normative sexual behavior reflects perhaps most directly the twisting and fluid nature of the human subconscious —it is intertwined with our animal past, complicated by our cerebral evolution, and manifested in our daily lives. With this article I intend to analyze the spectrums by which these non-normal sexual behaviors are defined and draw a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, our society seems to have created several spectrums with which to quantify sexual preference. There is a spectrum along the sex line — whether one prefers a penis or vagina. Another spectrum exists along the gender line — this is harder to define, but slides from typically masculine behavioral traits to typically feminine behavioral traits. A third spectrum spans between what is considered “vanilla sex” and “kinky sex” — this covers a vast variety of possible “kinks,” but fundamentally hinges on the sex act itself. A fourth spectrum captures the idea of monoamory (literally ‘one love’) versus polyamory (literally ‘many loves’) — though this spectrum, perhaps, can be represented as a simple binary preference.</p>\n<p>So let us start by looking at the first spectrum, as it decides whether someone is gay or straight. The psychology behind this spectrum is incredibly convoluted by our society. It is entirely preferable to be heterosexual in this culture, but the fact homosexuals exist suggests that there is a large genetic component. But we define sexuality as a spectrum for a reason — many people hover in the middle of pure straight and pure gay, developing a preference over time and through experimentation. But in the end there is a distinct lack of control involved with where you end up. Some people are compelled to only find penises attractive, some people vaginas. And, of course, some are lucky enough to be able to fluidly shift between the two.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But if the sex preference is determined by factors beyond society’s means to control, the gender preference is almost a complete societal construction. By creating distinct images of what a man should be and what a woman should be, society can compel its population to find certain things attractive or unattractive. The root of the preference, however, is simple. One finds certain personality traits attractive, and based on how many of those traits are masculine or feminine, finds a place on this scale.</p>\n<p>The kink scale arises from a person’s preferences surrounding the sex act itself. Some people enjoy dominating others, while some enjoy being dominated. Others might find feet irresistible, or latex or furry animal costumes. Kink comes out of the deep places of the subconscious, and the number of fetishes are so diverse they escape analysis by simple means. And so to define where one lays on this spectrum, one must turn to the definition of normal. Again, what is “normal” sex and what is “kinky” sex is here defined by society. Thus, kink is a measure of how normative one’s preference in sexual activity is.</p>\n<p>And, finally, we have the binary of one single love versus many loves. This might arise from two places — the first is a throwback to patriarchal systems. This system can be observed in archaic Mormonism, where men were polygamists while women were monogamous (polygyny, in other words). The more contemporary version of polyamory seems to derive itself from the concepts of free love and, more generally, communalism. Men and women can possess multiple partners and all of it seems to be in the spirit of the freedom to love as many as one wants. Monoamory, on the other hand, promotes the idea of giving one’s all to a single, special person. It is individualistic and romantic and is the normalized model in our culture.</p>\n<p>Now, each of these scales possesses a societal majority side (heterosexual, cis-gender, vanilla sex, and monoamory) and each possesses a minority side. Interestingly, however, where one exists on each spectrum is not coupled to where one exists on the others. A heterosexual man could be kinky with his one very special butch female. A bisexual could have vanilla sex with her somewhat feminine male partner on Tuesdays and her caring female partner of Thursdays. Gays can settle down with one person or many. And the reason for this decoupling is the fundamental deterministic psychology behind each preference.</p>\n<p>The sex preference is a biological and social imperative about what a person has sex with.</p>\n<p>The gender spectrum is a personality-based preference about with whom a person has sex.</p>\n<p>The kink preference is about how a person has sex.</p>\n<p>The poly/monoamory is about how many people the person allocates emotion to.</p>\n<p>The behaviors do not arise from the same roots – they are independent preferences and come with independent desires. Interestingly, however, the sexual minorities from each group are often linked together in the social conscious and treated as a single, bulk community.</p>\n<p>Thus we reach the point I wanted to draw. It is dangerous to set equal these minorities in the social psychology, as they represent very different interests and very different goals. Each minority group deserves equality, but to treat a gay person as identical to a polyamorist or a fetishist as someone who is gender queer is an offensive simplification of sexual identity and sexual preference. Some gays want nothing more than to settle down with one true love, while others push for their polyamory to be accepted. Some fetishists enjoy the company of the same sex and others of the opposite.</p>\n<p>And so, it is my hope that our society might start to see the sexual minorities as individual communities, allied in their struggle for acceptance but not identical in their desires or differences. Each represents a different aspect of society’s relationship with sex, and each should be examined as its own unique identity.</p>\n<p><em>Anonymous tops his scoop of vanilla with a dopple of kink-sauce.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49043\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49043\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/","id":6375,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6374,6373,6372],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Who’s On Top and Who’s On Bottom: The Sex Politics of Positioning","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It is with this article today that I wish to start examining the way that sex has shaped our culture, particularly as it is relevant to I.V., and I feel an excellent place to start this is by examinin...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It is with this article today that I wish to start examining the way that sex has shaped our culture, particularly as it is relevant to I.V., and I feel an excellent place to start this is by examining an interesting aspect of sexual psychology that is perhaps one of the most ingrained in our culture. It is an unfortunate aspect that shapes our world in a biased manner and has created inequality since its unfortunate conception in the age of patriarchal religion. And so, I wish to turn my eye upon this in hopes of making others reflect at least briefly on the subject and perhaps work to undo some of the damage this — and there is no better word for it — assumption does.</p>\n<p>In sex, there is virtually always an active role and a passive role. Some sexual acts manage to get around this requirement — the one that comes to mind is a certain number (69) — but for the most part, one person is acting and the other receiving. In normal, coital sex, the active role is assumed to be the male and the passive role by the female. And thus in a single sentence I have managed to identify exactly what is problematic in our contemporary formulation of sexual power — that the passive role is passive, and the active role is active. In this terminology, power is inherently unbalanced, and it casts the woman in an immediately weaker light.</p>\n<p>Now, one might stop here to say that they do not view women as weaker. That is good for you, I’m happy for you, but when we speak in generalities about sexual power, few will dispute that men (the active role) are widely considered to come out on top (incidentally, for you gay people, feel free to generalize this conversation to tops and bottoms). In a certain base way the imbalance of power seems to follow as a logical conclusion. Simply speaking, the active role is who is making the sex happen. For, without the thrusting, there is no groaning. But if we take this definition of ‘the most power’ as being ‘who makes the sex happen,’ then the model breaks down immediately after one issue is examined …</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Consider oral sex.</p>\n<p>Why is it that in a psychological formulation of oral sex, if the male is receiving he appears dominant — he is somehow forcing the female to operate on him — and yet when the female is receiving the male still,</p>\n<p>subconsciously speaking, feels dominant — he is now just operating on her. So this idea that the one who is making sex happen is dominant is not strictly true. Our society seeks to hand the power to who has the penis or who is sticking their penis into someone else. Logically speaking, the giver of oral sex should be considered the active sexual participant. She/he is not only making the entire sexual event occur, but could quite easily demonstrate how much power he/she wields by biting down.</p>\n<p>That would rather quickly demonstrate who is really holding the cards.</p>\n<p>Thus, society clearly has not defined our power balance based on any logical consideration of who is making the sex happen. That argument is just a fallacy crafted to defend what is an essentially patriarchal power trip.</p>\n<p>So, why do we argue that the man (or top) is the dominant aspect in the sexual yin-yang? Does it have to do with actual physical strength? Perhaps it once did. Physical strength and dominance have been mingled with sex acts since quite literally the dawn of social animals.</p>\n<p>Examine lions, bulls or monkeys — he who sticks it in someone else is considered more powerful. But when humans introduced consciousness and law into the mix, this condition broke down. Rapists who dare use these base acts as a show of power go to prison, where they rapidly become the sexual recipient of a 300 pound man named Little Tinabell. In our civilized society, the power women wield as the passive sexual partner is so real that it was demonized by the Christians and made mystical by other religions. Women as witches, enchantresses and various magical beings all arise from this ability they (and by extension any attractive, passive sexual being) wield to compel their desirers into what is essentially slavery (marriage). And all because they are willing to take a penis into their body. This strikes me as quite a bit of power.</p>\n<p>So when we consider a world where law holds — where a rapist is punished severely and painfully — one cannot say that being able to stick it in someone makes you any more powerful or dominant. And yet we still do it. The idea that the passive role is somehow less dominant is so ingrained in our culture that it has become a natural assumption. Insults are framed around who is fucking who, power balances are assumed from sexual configurations and speculations are made about relationship dynamics from singular facts.</p>\n<p>Now, I will probably not stop saying ‘that midterm fucked me,’ in reference to a midterm that was particularly difficult. That form of insult is so ingrained into my lingual patterns that it honestly</p>\n<p>doesn’t even carry the psychological implications I’ve stated here — saying something has fucked me is just a way of saying it did me harm in some way. But while I wouldn’t ask you to change your language</p>\n<p>conventions, I do ask that you seriously think about where they came from, and if those assumptions are still an integral part of your psyche.</p>\n<p>Because honestly, when a man hires a stripper, one person is walking away with $500 and another is just walking away with a boner.</p>\n<p>Who really wielded the power there?</p>\n<p><em>From 1 to 100, Anonymous always chooses 69.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48655\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/whos-top-whos-bottom-sex-politics-positioning-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48655\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/whos-top-whos-bottom-sex-politics-positioning-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/whos-top-whos-bottom-sex-politics-positioning-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/whos-top-whos-bottom-sex-politics-positioning-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-07/whos-top-whos-bottom-sex-politics-positioning-2/","id":6369,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6368,6367,6366],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Just Short of Naked: Halloween Costumes That Work Your Assets","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As Halloween approaches, I find myself wondering what wonders the October holiday has in store for me.

Will I relive freshman year, when a downpour melted the “costumes” off of a group of Isla Vista women, and my friend and I were given the unforgettable image of a pack of women running while holding their exposed breasts? Will I again encounter the guy in assless chaps strutting his situation all over DP? Or will I be treated to police on horseback confiscating a dominatrix’s horsewhip because it poses a clear and present danger to her submissive counterpart?</p>\n<p>One would hope.

Square one is the most natural of the costume choices: the “really, you might as well be naked, who are you kidding?” costume. This costume may also be known as the Nurse, the Firefighter, the Bumblebee or the “Duh … I’m a rabbit!” It involves wearing virtually nothing. Now, the tactic is very simple: Show a lot of skin. I am a personal fan of this tactic, as it is beautifully simple and also beautifully motivational. For example, I have been convinced to be a Home Depot-themed male stripper on one of the nights this weekend. I partially agreed to this because I have been slacking in the exercise department lately, and the idea of having to walk around in nothing but boxers, a tool belt and some tastefully placed washers is truly an impetus to undo the damages these first few weeks of school have inflicted on my exercise routine. So the “who are you kidding” costume has the benefit of being a motivational tool, as well as a fun way to parade yourself without shame. If you’ve never tried a “who are you kidding” costume, I wholeheartedly recommend it.</p>\n<p>Next, we will examine the suave costume. This costume involves being a badass, and usually involves wearing something conservative but slimming. For women, this can be stiletto heels, a whip and skintight leather. For men, more often than not, it’s a superhero costume. My default suave guise is a Batman suit. On top of being well-known, this choice agrees nicely with the fact over half of my wardrobe is black. Now, in the same way I respect the stripper outfits for being physically motivating, the suave costume tests intelligence and creativity. Since you cannot simply show skin and be done in this costume, you must rely on equal parts wit and sexiness. It’s the classy seduction — the woman in the sexy, floor-length dress or the man in the full-body business suit. It takes raw charisma, but if you make it work, you will be getting phone numbers left and right.</p>\n<p>The third costume is the cuddly, innocuous one. This costume is what the slut costume would be if you actually dressed as a bunny, bumblebee or Charlie Brown (and yes, that implies that I have seen a slutty Charlie Brown). It is fuzzy, conservative and at first glance completely unisexual. Then you’re suddenly 10 drinks deep and that bunny costume starts to look pretty soft, and the next morning you have to reconsider thinking furries are just weird fetishists. Now, some of the people wrapped from head to toe are actually quite devious. They use that Minnie Mouse costume to catch you off guard, and a moment later they are clumsily fumbling at you with their cartoon hands. I speak from personal experience. Not from a Halloween party, but at a ‘toon theme costume party where I found myself pinned to the wall by a particularly horny Roger Rabbit. It was terrifying. Beware the Care Bear whose gaze fixes on you the moment you walk into the room, for soon you will learn why they wanted you to call them “Love-a-Lot” bear.</p>\n<p>And finally, we have the “wtf?” costume. A favorite of hipsters, the sole purpose of this costume appears to be that you have to ask what it is. It may be a sign hanging around someone’s neck. It may be a single,</p>\n<p>strangely shaped protrusion from their chest. Or it might be a weird symbol tattooed on their face. Either way, I have to respect the simplicity involved with the wtf? strategy. Especially if it is accompanied by a good pickup line:</p>\n<p>“Hey, my friend and I were just wondering, what are you?”</p>\n<p>“I’m whatever you want me to be, baby.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps this approach lacks creativity, but it nonetheless has potential for sex appeal. I’m one to judge anyways, as lack of creativity is precisely why I will be dressing up as a Home Depot stripper this Halloween. Tips in the tool belt, please.</p>\n<p><em>Anonymous does not condone violating pumpkins.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/","id":6370,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6369,6368,6367],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Coming Out With a Bang: This Hump Columnist’s Out and Proud","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Readers, it is with my first words that I must apologize: This Hump will not be on the seduction strategies of women in I.V. as was promised last week.

My best female friend knew before I did, and my best male friend found out over a game of Halo when I was in 11th grade. So the point is that coming out isn’t always — or even usually — something that happens in a day.</p>\n<p>Most often it’s a matter of years, and for many people it involves a system of picking and choosing to whom they should come out. (Believe it or not, that whole flamboyance thing can usually be flicked on and off like some boa-wearing desk lamp.) But now, to the “whys” of coming out.</p>\n<p>Frankly speaking, I haven’t exactly reaped delicious fruits of societal acceptance by being out of the closet. Many of the openly gay groups on campus actually come across quite alienating to me. Rather, they appeal to some very specific types of gays while other similarly “out” people such as myself face almost complete rejection from any closet case who knows they aren’t closeted — the liability is too much to be worth it. So for people who don’t feel an overwhelming attraction to the focal points of many gay events (the flamboyant pride, drag shows, etc.), being out doesn’t necessarily mean an avalanche of new, easily acquired fellow gay friends. But this is not to say I’m completely alone.</p>\n<p>I still have my armada of straight friends, men and women, and it is not as though all gays are somewhere embedded in the clubs on campus — I have found several whom I maintain friendships with. But what I primarily got from this whole open and proud thing is exactly that: pride. I can’t rightfully judge those who stay in the closet for good reasons; many might risk hurting familial relationships or security if they came out without any discretion.</p>\n<p>But the theory is that if someone asks, I tell the truth. I just don’t advertise the fact (other than the whole thing where I, you know, publish it in newspapers). And I take pride in that I tell the truth. It makes me feel good knowing I’m owning up to who I am and not hiding from myself or others. I’ve never been one to back down from a fight, so if some asshole has a problem with the fact I’m gay, I will more than happily engage them.</p>\n<p>This, in my opinion, is the true point of coming out: It’s a matter of pride. It’s a matter of saying “no” to a society that denies you basic rights, that would treat you as less of a man or some aberration of a woman, or where so many believe you should not speak freely as you bleed for your freedom (don’t let it be said Obama has accomplished nothing). Looking someone in the eye and telling them “Yes, I’m a fag” is my small way of contributing to correcting an injustice.</p>\n<p>I was given a unique ability to help humanity by owning who I am and increasing a statistic that tells people that gays are here to stay, and we won’t lie because you’re afraid your children will contract a crippling case of homo.</p>\n<p>So to conclude: Do I personally gain much from being openly gay? No, not really. My interest in the events and culture offered by the gay groups on campus is limited, and I don’t acquire a lot from having the credentials to get in. What I get are the weird looks, the boys telling me they “are afraid gay guys are into them,” and the mutters when I kiss someone I care about in public. But I also get to stare those people down and say “Fuck you” with pride.</p>\n<p><em>Anonymous has his snow-goggles on, braced for the avalanche of new fellow gay friends that will surely result from this article.</em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

While adrift in our beloved deluge of drunks, I attempted to socialize or attract potential mates. All around me people made similar efforts. As I watched people stumble home with men or women or both hanging off their limbs, my mind turned to what it was that made some successful and some less so.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the techniques applied by men and women are many, but from my time in I.V., I have narrowed the number of strategies down. For the purposes of this article, I will be heteronormalizing my assessment to cover the strategies applied by “masculine” men and “feminine” women, but it would be poor science if I left out that these strategies can be inverted in certain cases.</p>\n<p>There are a number of types of males in this world, but from my observations the four most common techniques applied by the XYs can be described as the following: Annoying Douchebag, Quiet Creeper, Prince Charming and Gigglebunny. The Annoying Douchebag is perhaps the most common; they are the males that are constantly drinking beer and greeting women (or men, as the case may be) as they walk in the door. They appear to be immune to the dirty looks of women and men alike and oblivious to how overbearing they can come across as. However, due to their ‘cast a wide enough net’ strategy and the fact that — to the intoxicated — they are highly charismatic, they often enjoy the most sexual success. I believe their charisma comes from what is fundamentally their predictability. The Annoying Douchebag is loud, gregarious and simple. He is, in short, safe to be around because it is hard to feel threatened by someone who seems so basic. Simplicity is, for many, attractive. As Isla Vistans, we should thank our various deities for the Annoying Douchebag, for he is the glue that holds our parties together.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the opposite end of this spectrum is the Quiet Creeper. This male tends to lurk toward the sides of parties, speaks sparingly and comes across to many as vaguely sociopathic. If the Annoying Douchebag is the machete of social interaction, the Quiet Creeper is the scalpel. And it is in their precision that they find hookup success. What many misunderstand about the QC is that he is just some introvert who has been thrust into a very extroverted situation, and his social strategy will reflect this. He will analyze the situation, find people who he thinks look interesting, and speak to them. If he can’t find anyone, he will just lurk until someone approaches him (usually an Annoying Douchebag or their female counterpart). His charisma is that of mystery, and he attracts accordingly. The QC is also typically more cerebral than the rest, and so appeals to those who have become bored with the party, and seek a different sort of entertainment. While a bizarre strategy, Quiet Creeping has proven reasonably successful for both myself and others, thus I list it here.</p>\n<p>Next is Prince Charming. A close relative of the Annoying Douchebag, Prince Charming picks out one attractive female (or male, as the case may be) and promptly devotes his entire night to trying to impress her (or him). He’ll ask her to dance, tell the Annoying Douchebags who approach her to fuck off, and generally appoints himself as her personal bodyguard. While it may seem like Prince Charming is the type to really want relationships, it’s common that after he has bedded the girl (or boy), he’ll move on to charm someone else the next Saturday night. Charming’s charisma is that of persistence. He’s there the entire night, so you might as well have him there the entire night.</p>\n<p>And finally, at the end of our list, we have the Gigglebunny. The Gigglebunny is the guy who is either so drunk or so stupid that all he appears capable of doing is laughing at literally everything anyone says. Research is uncertain as to whether the Gigglebunny is actually cognizant of what they are laughing at, or if they simply wire a sort of reflexive giggle response anytime their brain processes human speech. To be perfectly honest, the charisma of the Gigglebunny eludes my classification. It may simply be that humans find laughter attractive. Gigglebunnies will seem to play every drinking game and participate in every conversation, but are in fact just the drugged-up embodiment of a sitcom laugh track. While the Gigglebunny exists in both male and female circles, the male Gigglebunny differs subtly from the female Gigglebunny in that the male has a penis. Gigglebunnies don’t have enough personality for there to be any other difference. Gigglebunnies frighten and confuse me because I can’t actually determine what they are doing, and yet somehow they are still taking people home at the end of the night. Perhaps Gigglebunnies are just ingeniously disguised wizards.</p>\n<p>So those are the four most common (masculine) strategies for trying to bed someone in I.V. There are, of course, more, but most of those are just some combination of these primary colors of seduction.

These are undoubtedly our new and deeply respected incoming freshmen, and so allow me to welcome any new freshmen readers (or am I supposed to refer to you as ‘first years’? Someone told me the term ‘freshmen’ was considered offensive. If this is the case, I will be continuing to offend you, freshmen) to the Wednesday Hump. This is where those without focus in class or without friends in the dining commons receive a weekly dose of some stranger’s sexual ponderings. It is a pleasure to have you added to the pool of potential mates — assuming of course you choose to assimilate into the dominant culture of this place — and I hope that you enjoy your sojourn in the twisted wonderland of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>But let’s talk business before pleasure. There is a choice before those new to the sociological experiment number 93117; this choice is whether to become one of the many substance-fueled hookup machines or to attempt to be normal in the conventional sense and not succumb to the pheromone-dominated atmosphere that is typical of college culture. The choice here, on a deeper level, is the classic one between security and freedom. Those who pick the former gain sexual security, comfort and a place to spend the night should they lock themselves out of their house. Those who prefer the latter gain experimental license, a fun game to play on boring nights and multiple places to spend the night should they lock themselves out of their house.</p>\n<p>So let us examine this, the fundamental conflict that differentiates the two primary breeds in Isla Vista, and why we might choose the side we do.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Biologically, it is argued that men of the college age should prefer sexual freedom to security and women vice versa. Unfortunately, these conclusions were drawn by men and women who had been quite effectively indoctrinated by Western cultural norms, and, in truth, I could bury one in biological arguments as to why women should be promiscuous and men monogamous. The point, of course, being that sociobiology is a poorly understood field at best, and should be regarded with the same vague boredom that most restrictively simplistic social theories deserve. If you would like further evidence that the biological arguments can be disproven, I present you with two common subspecies of human: the raging female sex addict and the annoying, clingy boyfriend.</p>\n<p>So what does drive us to be borderline hookers or cripplingly boring? Well, as borderline hookers, we get to explore aspects of human nature that are not only intellectually fascinating (because I know every single student at UCSB seeks intellectual ascension above all else), but also animalistically enthralling. The borderline hookers get to go out with the thrill of knowing that they might be getting lucky tonight — it’s a challenge, a game of skill and seduction. To anyone even vaguely familiar with the concept of ennui, this chance to play is a more powerful aphrodisiac than Spanish fly- infused chocolate dipped in oyster sauce (incidentally, delicious). And putting aside the allure of the challenge, the borderline hookers also benefit from the ability to experiment with impunity. Think you might be a chubby chaser? Go for it! Bright magenta hair? No problem. A threesome that involves exorbitant amounts of marshmallows? Hell yes, why not?</p>\n<p>But what of the other option? Security. Well, there is the obvious: emotional and physical comfort given on relative demand. You also don’t need to worry about accidentally contributing to the evolution of a new plethora of bacteria and fungi in your nether regions. And, finally, these repeated encounters with the same person are typically considered to hold more meaning. Commitment is a show of feelings and a symbol that you are willing to surrender massive amounts of fun simply because of how much you love someone.</p>\n<p>Now, my various grumpy, polyamorous readers, I’ll mention for you that this whole commitment thing is likely a result of cultural indoctrination. If you wish to reprogram the culture go right ahead. But, for the time being, most people view commitment, in the form of agreeing only to touch genitals with one other person, as the ultimate act of love. So there’s the allure of the second option: love, most people’s ultimate goal.</p>\n<p>I cannot tell you, freshmen, which path to walk, but I can observe this: college is a time for experimentation and casting the net, but the goal of such a cast is often to reel in something real. My advice, then, is this: don’t settle, but don’t be afraid to settle down.</p>\n<p>Welcome to IV.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-09-24/year-fornication-hump-question-2/","id":6402,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6401,6400,6399],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Coming Out on Top:  The Down-Low on Bending the Straight Line and Pegging the Sexually Confused","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If you ever feel like risking your immortal soul, it is my suggestion that you peruse Craigslist’s casual encounters.

The activity is quite enjoyable, especially if you are as demented as me and my close friend and turn the experience into a party game, as it provides the opportunity to see just how twisted the psychosexual realm of this particular, somewhat troubling outlet of the gay population is. You will learn new terminology — Craigslist is like a crash course in gay code — as well as notice a very curious trend about the state of at least 80 percent of the under-24 population who has resorted to posting and posing their lust on the Internet.</p>\n<p>People are often shocked when I tell them I’ve hooked up with frat boys. They would probably be more shocked if I listed their actual names. There is a phenomenon in the gay community known as “turning,” in which a homosexual seduces a heterosexual. It’s not an uncommon thing, yet people never fail to be surprised, and often ask me how I do it. The truth is I exploit a weakness in our cultural logic. I exploit sexual fluidity, gender role malleability and our environment’s gluttonous fondness for casual, meaningless sex to expand the hidden desires of the “straight.”</p>\n<p>And, of course, I choose my targets well. I don’t (typically) choose the men who I know prefer women and “women only.” I’ve been in the game and was in the closet long enough to recognize people who have flirted with their own sexual confusion. Sure, I’ll occasionally hook up with someone I know will die the husband of some lady. But I would say that for the most part, I’m with someone who could just as easily marry a man and even maybe be happier for it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And yet, people still think I turn straight guys. So I will say it now: I am only turning closeted bisexuals and closeted gay men. I cannot speak about lesbians and I would rather be silent than wrong. But let us acknowledge this particular phenomenon, and examine the reasons, the means and the tools involved in maintaining the Closet Case.</p>\n<p>In 2012 California, one does not expect to be attacked by a governor’s son if they come out as gay. Still that decision often has great consequences. Coming out of the closet involves surrendering the following: claims to what has been culturally instilled in us as the fundamental masculine trait, virtually all available prototypes of ideal relationships, the culturally ideal relationship and what has been framed as a fundamental part of identity — one’s sexual preference.</p>\n<p>In shifting from “straight” to “gay,” one sacrifices an unspeakably large amount. For those gay men who prefer the shooting range to Forever 21, this sacrifice can be too great. Our gendered society has coupled the preference to have sex with women with strength, stoicism and the multitude of traits associated with masculinity. The coupling is so strong that I have heard “I don’t care if they’re gay, as long as they aren’t those faggy gays” in my own home, and variations of this sentiment throughout my interactions with “masculine” men.</p>\n<p>This implication is of course that being gay carries with it “faggy” traits. Neglecting these traits then is the only way to make your homosexuality palatable to the masculine hierarchs. I’ve known those whose friend groups consist exclusively of hyper-masculine, gym-obsessed men (behavior that is in itself a red flag for sexual conflict), and they would not compromise their entire social standing by coming out. Indeed, even people I know to be accepting of gays are horrified when I casually suggest that maybe the reason their bro doesn’t get with women very often is because he doesn’t actually want to.</p>\n<p>But even assuming that someone can define one’s masculinity intrinsically and not by an external code, there is still immeasurable loss involved in the coming out process. Those considering coming out must consciously acknowledge that they will never have access to the picture-perfect, Disney-portrayed relationships that pop culture views as perfect. You will never have nor be the prince and princess according to that cultural narrative. One of the most painful experiences, however, involves realizing that a woman who may already be in your life isn’t the one, despite how gorgeous and down-to-earth she is — no matter how goddamn perfect she may seem.</p>\n<p>So instead you face the unknown of constructing a relationship — a balanced, happy relationship — from imagination, trial-and-error and prayer. For masculine gays who are attracted to masculinity, they have no reference. In coming out they must admit to themselves that they cannot use basic relationship models to help them in their life. It’s a frightening revelation.</p>\n<p>And because our society is obsessed with sexual orientation classes, this choice is typically irreversible. Once you’ve admitted you’re attracted to men, you are gay or bisexual. My own sister admitted she wouldn’t feel comfortable in a relationship with a bisexual because she’d be insecure about his interests. My sister, for reference, is one of the most compassionate and liberal people I know. The corruption is deep — many do not have the prejudice, but many more do — and our strict system of sexuality forces those who want access to their same-sex desires to take on all the prejudices in their simple choice to be honest.</p>\n<p>So that’s the why, and now the how. The casual sex dominant in I.V. and the massive amounts of drug use allow closeted gays to remain hidden indefinitely. I have a fond memory of one of my straight friends talking about how his friend only hooks up with women when he’s “drunk enough” because his standards are so high. Yes, right, your heterosexual friend must get drunk to lower his standards, to make kissing the notoriously gorgeous women of Santa Barbara stomachable. The ones who are closeted can produce convincing illusions because they can simply drug their souls into oblivion and then play the part. After 19 beers, most people would have sex with a curvaceous oak tree, and yet since drunken sex is normalized in I.V. and emotional considerations aren’t even conscious thoughts, the illusion is perfect.</p>\n<p>By exploiting sexual fluidity and neglecting emotional desires entirely, the closet cases are in an ideal position to continue positioning themselves above women. And in 10 years, when partying can’t be their whole life anymore, they will have to face the truth and join the legions of late-in-life masculine gay men this country boasts.</p>\n<p>But, you know what? Fuck that. I’ve watched enough people suffer at the hands of our society’s weird sexual hang-ups. I’ve had friendships decay, relationships wither and potential flames flicker out because of the poisonous Puritanism injected into the sexual culture of this country hundreds of years ago. Every day, I reflect on the people I’ve known who still struggle to find that inner peace that will let them be as they are. Every day, I wonder if I could have done something different — crafted the right words to uplift the fearful — and become their shelter, and they mine. And every day, I maintain this vague hope that I can do better the next time I meet someone who is so deeply alone.</p>\n<p>But I know that I really can’t do anything to help the closet cases. The forces caging them are bigger than me. They are greater than any queer activist group. They are more obvious than Pride parades and more subtle than the difference between being happy and being at peace. Change of the magnitude required for true liberation won’t happen overnight, just like one night with a closet case won’t assuage his inner turmoil.</p>\n<p>Straight people: Be allies. Do not pretend to truly understand the challenges of coming out, but know your support can mean the difference between someone finding love in high school, and ripping apart a family in 20 years because Dad finally couldn’t do it anymore.</p>\n<p>Open gays: If anything in this article was new to you, please take it into consideration when you frame your activism. The depth of this issue won’t be touched by tactics of glitter bombs and giant floats. Those are necessary for certain issues, but a sledgehammer will not always be able to replace a scalpel.</p>\n<p>And to the closet cases: I’m sorry that this is where you are. But by that promised land of equality I hope to see in my lifetime, I hope that you will let yourself be openly loved by that guy who you’ve secretly wanted since the day you found him at freshman orientation.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.
