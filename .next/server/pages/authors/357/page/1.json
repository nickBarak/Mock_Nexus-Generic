However, I don’t feel comfortable going out to protest in person because of the current pandemic. What are some ways that I can show my support/get more involved with the movement?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, thank you for showing support and interest in this issue. As someone who comes from an African American background, it gives me hope to see the world take up this cause and stand in solidarity. I completely understand your apprehension to protest because COVID-19 is still at large in this country. Our health is important, and there are plenty of other ways to contribute at home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would like to emphasize that one of the most imperative steps you can take is to become educated regarding the systemic racism and inequality in our society. White privilege is not something to be ashamed of but instead something non-people of color can become educated about and recognize to help fight racism in America. Currently, streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime and Netflix are offering movies such as “Just Mercy” and “13TH” that highlight injustices in our prison system. I also encourage you to look into books such as “The Hate U Give,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Angie Thomas, and “Unbreakable Resolve: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Triumphant Stories of 3 True Gentlemen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Rideau, Jerome Morgan and Robert Jones.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These texts and movies aid non-POC in understanding the everyday challenges that Black people face in the United States.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having difficult conversations with friends and family who disagree with the movement is another way to help the cause.

One of my housemates moved back to the Netherlands after her semester abroad at UCSB. The house misses her like hell. Any advice on how we can cope? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m sorry! I know it can be tough to have to say goodbye so soon. Thankfully, FaceTime and Zoom can help us stay in touch even when we cannot be physically together. Having game nights, cooking sessions or movie nights over Zoom can make you feel like she never left. When my best friend moved away for college, one idea we had was to send monthly friendship boxes. During finals week, we would ship each other self-care items and snacks to help cheer the other up. This helped us to always keep each other in our thoughts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to communicate is by sending letters. When my other friend was sent to the army, we would send long letters and photos regarding updates in our life. This made our conversations feel more meaningful. No matter how far the distance, a simple message showing you care helps keep a friendship bond strong. It’s also important to focus on the memories you made with her, and how in the future there will always be time to make more. As my friends and I were all moving off to different places in life for college and careers, I kept saying to them, this is not goodbye, but a to be continued</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Should I be rethinking my addiction to Puff Bars because of Corona? I don’t know if I can live without nicotine but I’m too young to die.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without even factoring in COVID-19, I would recommend trying to quit smoking. Nicotine is linked to cancer and heart and lung diseases. These issues alone can shorten your lifespan significantly. Now with COVID-19 spreading through the world, our bodies need to be at their strongest to fight off this disease. The coronavirus is a respiratory disease that targets the lungs, and with weaker lung capacities from vaping, you are at risk to have more severe symptoms that can turn fatal. The </span><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-on-smoking-and-covid-19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Health Organization</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recommends quitting tobacco use immediately. Within 20 minutes of quitting, one’s elevated heart rate and blood pressure drop. After just a few weeks of not smoking, circulation improves and lung capacity increases. I understand how addicting nicotine can be, but I urge you to seek nicotine replacement therapies and the support of loved ones for quitting tobacco use.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Frosted tips: hot or not?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I can’t speak for everyone else, I know that whenever I see anyone with frosted tips, I assume they are going through a life crisis. Frosted tips to me are like cutting your own bangs, a last resort for excitement and change in one’s life. Now if you were Justin Timberlake in the 1990s, that would be a whole different story, but I don’t think this trend is coming back any time soon. If you want to dye your hair, I’d recommend something more natural and subtle like highlights. However, before you get in that salon chair, think long and hard about your decision. Speaking as someone who dyed their hair red in high school during a rebellious stage, it takes a lot of time and money to reverse. </span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within a few short weeks, all of our lives have changed and now updates on the coronavirus seem to come by the hour. Uncertainty breeds a mix of feelings, whether that’s anxiety over how to stay healthy, sadness caused by social distancing or happiness from spending more time with loved ones. The ambiguity inherent in uncertainty can trigger almost any emotion —  and all of these emotions you are feeling are natural. That being said, as young, healthy college students, we are in a unique position of both privilege and vulnerability.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On privilege, I’ll be the first to say it: Check your privilege. No, this isn’t just directed towards the senior srat members sulking over the loss of spring break 2020. It’s about all of us. It’s about the fact that we are all being impacted by this new reality in different ways. For some of us, the largest inconvenience we will face is taking our classes online and not getting to see our friends in person, but many members of our community are facing challenges beyond that of a student. Many will lose their lives and many more will lose their loved ones, their livelihoods, their jobs and their health. We have all lost a part of our freedom, but our privileges are unique to each of us, and it is for that reason that community is so vital.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The virus is here. There is one identified case in Isla Vista so far and we cannot afford to be selfish and think only of ourselves. Don’t wait for this to become “real’’ or relevant to you. Don’t wait until you know someone who has it or know someone who has lost a family member. The virus is affecting our community now and our community’s health depends on how effectively all of us practice social distancing. We have the capacity to stay home without completely halting our lives. We have the privilege of taking our courses online and we have the power to support each other. Think of your neighbors, think of the people you love, the people you don’t, the human lives at risk and when you think of your own very real struggles, think of them among the struggles of those which make up our community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while having this awareness, it is also important to evaluate how these sudden changes have affected you. The world is moving forward and we are moving forward with it, but many of us haven’t stopped to feel that move for everything that it is and will be. As college students, we have an almost inevitable dependence on our campus, not just as our place for academic development but our place for meaningful interpersonal interaction. Our lives as college students provide us with routine and stability; our campus fosters curiosity and evokes creativity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are vulnerable to the sudden loss of all of the smallest details that made up our days: the light, ocean mist in the morning, the bustle of the bike lane, the familiar energy of the Arbor. And in many ways, we are vulnerable to silence at a time when we need to think and process and feel. So, to come full circle, do your rambling. You may not have clear feelings about the loss of riding around the bike circles or late nights in the library, but you know you have some feelings about it. Rambling your way through those thoughts with your friends will be a good reminder that you’re not alone. We are here and we are struggling together.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*socially distanced* xoxo,</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AJ</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to alleviate stress during times of uncertainty is to stay informed!

I was planning on going home to see my parents but at this rate, I don’t think I can risk going home and getting my parents sick. What should I do?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any issue you have with housemates, it’s important to address it as soon as possible, as calmly as possible and as reasonably as possible. With this issue in particular, there is a lot at stake. I would suggest having a conversation with all of your housemates to establish some rules and practices during the coronavirus. None of us have lived through a pandemic before so it’s not expected that everyone will react to this situation in the same way. However, that isn’t an excuse to be careless or insensitive to one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line: Your home is a shared space. Given how easily the virus spreads, your house is only as safe as the most careless person in it. Even if four out of five of your housemates are cautious, one housemate being inconsiderate about hygiene or who they interact with will put you all at risk. This isn’t to say that your house needs to be on lockdown, but there are ways all of you can actively work to protect each other while making sure people feel comfortable in their own spaces. For instance, you could all make sure you wash your hands as soon as you come home or develop a cleaning schedule. You may also want to discuss what will happen if one of you gets sick. Will there be a designated bathroom for that person? How will you ensure you are all properly informed on best practices to keep each other healthy? Where will this person go if they need medical assistance? That is up for your house to decide, but having these conversations early will help reduce potentially stressful and risky situations. Having awareness is extremely important — be aware of your own needs and be prepared to advocate for yourself, but also be aware of how your actions may impact others around you.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The coronavirus is basically the flu, why is everyone freaking out so much? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not the fucking flu. Although there are some symptoms that resemble those of the flu, COVID-19 should not be handled as if it is the average flu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years ago, Bill Gates gave us a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AEMKudv5p0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As he put it, “an epidemic that would be more infectious and spread faster than Ebola did… is the greatest risk of a huge tragedy.” This would be the kind of tragedy Gates said we were unprepared for. He identified two main types of flus: ones that spread effectively between humans and ones that are extremely deadly. Those two factors have only occurred together once in history, during the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918, known as the Spanish flu, which took the lives of nearly 65 million people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mortality rates of both the Spanish flu and COVID-19 are roughly 2.5% for the time being, but the coronavirus’s potential to spread is what makes it even more deadly. Many people who are already infected display no symptoms for days. These are the people who are unknowingly spreading the disease and causing avoidable deaths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, hospitals’ capacities are limited by the number of available beds. Roughly 20% of coronavirus cases require hospital treatment and the virus’s ability to spread exponentially can lead to a surge in cases. This surge is what results in avoidable deaths due to our healthcare system being overwhelmed. That’s the key. If we are able to limit the total number of cases, there will be less of a need for hospital beds and less avoidable deaths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So yes, the flu kills hundreds of thousands of people, but its ability to spread is nothing like that of the coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Why is it racist to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus? It did start in China just like a lot of other really deadly diseases, and the Chinese government even tried to cover it up initially.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s racist because to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus would be attaching certain — most likely negative — ideas about the virus to an entire group of people. The actions and decisions of the Chinese government are not the actions of Chinese people as a whole. The actions by some Chinese people in one city or one region are not the actions of individuals of Chinese descent that live in America. Even if there was evidence that 100% linked the Coronavirus to a wet market in Wuhan, to attach the disease to an ethnic group is most definitely prejudicial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not the first time infectious disease has led to prejudice and it is certainly not the last. This pattern has only done damage to the sanctity of cultural diversity and the unity of this country. Ignorance should not be the choice we make as it will only spread hate and fear, if not reinforce the hold of xenophobia within the US.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">~ History lesson for you ~</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 1959-1961, the </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127087/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">largest famine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in history took place in China, killing an estimated more than 30 million people. In the following decades, much of China’s population remained in poverty and consequently was starving. The communist regime which controlled all food production was unable to provide enough for its people to survive. It was at this point in 1978 that the government allowed for private farming. This practice of private farming lifted millions of suffering people out of poverty. A </span><a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16603900.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">household-based contract responsibility system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was put in place in which land was leased to families with the conditions of meeting fixed output quotas. Families were given land to meet their own needs and it was on these smaller private farms that families caught wild animals such as turtles to feed themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because this wildlife farming was successful, it gained governmental support, which drastically changed the course of wildlife farming. These farms – whatever needed to be done to mitigate poverty – were encouraged. With the support of the government and the further development of policies to protect this type of farming, smaller farms turned into an industry and along with this industry came the illegal trading of endangered animals like tigers and pangolins. Some of these endangered species were later </span><a href=\"https://eia-international.org/wildlife/saving-tigers/tiger-farming/chinas-wildlife-protection-law/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sanctioned</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the government for sale.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What started as a solution to the imminent hunger plaguing families across China turned into an industry for the wealthy few of the country. China is the </span><a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/wild-laws-china-and-its-role-illicit-wildlife-trade\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">top consumer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of illegally traded species but these species are being consumed by the richest people in China — a minority of the population that holds extreme lobbying capabilities (what’s new). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So before you go stereotyping an entire group of people, think about what you might be missing.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>HELP!!!! CABIN FEVER!!!!!!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was my original inclination to tell you to try something new to fill your time, and I do encourage that, but you can only try so many new things before “trying something new” loses its excitement and sparkle. In that vein, I would say a few things: stay active, have regular virtual social contact and do more of what you love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to underestimate how much we actually move around when we go from class to class or to various meetings. Now that seemingly everything has been moved to the virtual world, it’s important not just to get up and move around, but to actually go outside. We live way too close to the beach and the mountains for anyone to stay inside anyways. Even if you’re not a particularly active person, taking a walk to the beach or even just around the block can be therapeutic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cannot stress enough how important social isolation is, but even though you shouldn’t physically be with anyone outside of the people you absolutely must see, you should still actively try to talk with your friends. Check up on them and also use this as a time to talk about how all of these changes have affected you. It is too easy to close yourself off to the world but short, regular check-ins with your loved ones will help you maintain your sanity while socially isolating. Plan wine nights or game nights with groups of friends once a week over FaceTime or Google Hangouts or Snapchat (try the filters — you won’t regret it). Having regular, scheduled meetings with your friends will give you something to look forward to. I also have gotten in the habit of sending my friends photos of puppies and Jude Law. Likewise, I always love it when I get articles from my dad or funny memes from my friends; these small points of contact throughout the day make all the difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, do more of what you love. Invest in doing the things you love and connect with people who share your interests. If you enjoy exercising, join a virtual yoga group or plan weekly runs around the lagoon with your housemates. If you enjoy reading, start a book club or make a reading schedule with all of the books you’d like to read. Plan virtual movie night or painting nights with friends. Set personal goals for yourself, something you can track. Whatever you enjoy, make plans and connect with others!</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost three years now and it’s going great, but a few weeks ago, he randomly asked me to move in with him after I graduate. The problem is that we live five states away from each other and he just recently moved out of his parents’ house. I like him enough to do it but it honestly scares me a bit. We’ve never met in person but we’ve video chatted. I just never thought he would ask something like that be</b><b>cause</b><b> he used to say that this wasn’t going to be a serious relationship for him. Every time he tries to bring it up again, I just either leave him on read or just change the subject.

Jumping from a virtual relationship to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">living </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">together is a huge decision, and one that deserves serious time, thought and open communication. The fact that you don’t feel comfortable addressing this topic with your boyfriend over text shows that you’re not ready for the type of communication that is required in order to live with another person. Though you say you have video chatted before, there are a lot of potential dangers associated with online relationships. Please, please be cautious when you do meet up in person. For example, make sure to share your location with your friends and family and to meet in a public setting, like a coffee shop — at least for the first few times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, think about your own priorities. Does moving across five states to be with him suit your plans for the future? Is it worth leaving behind your friends and family for a person who a) you’ve never actually met and b) said he didn’t want a serious relationship with you? Also, being in a happy relationship with someone doesn’t necessarily mean you’d be compatible as roommates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s the thing: You say you like him enough to move in with him — but do you love him? And if you’ve never met IRL, how can you tell the difference?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If he isn’t committed enough to meet you in person, it’s way too soon for you to commit to moving for him.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">♥</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Why should we trust an undergrad to deliver anything resembling sound life advice?<br>\n<em>-Anonymous</em></b></p>\n<p>Dear Anonymous,</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Times They Are a-Changin’. Would you really rather get life advice from a boomer?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ♥</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Dear AJ, I want to break up with my partner, but I know they have big Valentine’s Day plans for us, including tickets to Disneyland and some really expensive gifts. Should I stick it out for another week, or would that be lying?<br>\n</b><em><b>-Stuck In Love</b></em></p>\n<p>Dear Stuck In Love,</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you already know that you don’t want to be with your partner any longer, it’s best if you just get it frickin’ over with already and break things off. First off, do you really want to torture yourself by having to sit through elaborate Valentine’s Day plans with someone that you’re not in love with anymore?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, breakups are painful enough already. Can you imagine how much more your partner is going to hate you once they realize that you are breaking up with them days after they have spent their last pennies on you? From their point of view, at least if you cut things off now, they can use those Disney tickets on someone who won’t curb stomp their heart. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put yourself in their shoes and consider their needs and desires in these final moments of your relationship — especially since your timing fucking sucks. Communicating in a caring manner about why you are ending things on such short notice would also be helpful in reducing your partner’s confusion as this might be very hard for them. Though I understand that initiating breakups can be hard, make like a pair of Nikes and just do it! It would also be best if you did it as soon as possible because I know return policies on some items are only 14 days.</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

While it may seem a little intimidating at first, with a little preparation, some practice, open communication and industrial amounts of lube, you should be sliding your way to a new experience in no time.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a common misconception that </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anal sex can only be pleasurable for those who have a prostate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; however, regardless of gender, the anal cavity is filled with nerve endings. What people are most familiar with in terms of anal stimulation is the prostate gland, which is located at the bottom of the bladder, just in front of the rectum. And I only know that because I watched this</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Ayq248u_8\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While the opening to the anus is where most of the nerve endings are, stimulating the prostate is what is often most pleasurable and can even result in prostate-induced orgasms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those without a prostate, anal sex can still be enjoyable. Similar to vaginal sex, the clitoris is stimulated during anal sex. While a large portion of the clitoris is external, there is a portion that extends inside that is stimulated during anal sex and can cause clitoral orgasms. Some have even claimed having stronger orgasms during anal penetration than vaginal penetration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I will admit anal sex isn’t for everyone, I do think it is something you should try if you are curious. That being said, if you are going to try, it is extremely important to be prepared. Part of that preparation is finding a partner you are not only comfortable with, but someone you feel you can have an open line of communication with. Trying anal will be painful at first for whomever is being penetrated, so it’s important for each partner to be aware of how the other is feeling. Open communication will help both partners figure out what is most pleasurable for each of you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to finding your partner, there are a few other steps to take into consideration. A primary concern for people trying anal sex for the first time is cleanliness. While a little poop here and there should be expected, it is not something to worry about. In fact, </span><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/news/a17749/anal-sex-misconceptions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most fecal matter sits above the anus and rectum</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some people choose to use anal douching, but many are fine with just taking a little extra time to wash in and around the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also extremely important to stay relaxed and go slow during the act. Part of the reason anal sex hurts is due to tensing up. Let your body calm down and start with something small. Some people start with fingers or toys and then move to bigger things, such as butt plugs. Going slow will not only help prevent tearing but will also help build arousal. Before any penetration, however, make sure you are using lots of lube!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you take anything away from this article it should be that preparation will enhance your anal experience. There are a lot of resources online, but it’s important to remember that everyone’s bodies are different. To help you get started here are some tips on anal </span><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/tips/a6574/buttplay-for-the-wary/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foreplay</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. ;)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>My boss keeps hitting on me :( How do I get him to stop? I’m already dating someone else.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, I am so sorry you are going through this. Regardless of whether or not you are dating someone, this behavior is inappropriate and unfair, and you should not feel as if you need to justify your feelings about the situation. At the end of the day, his actions are making you uncomfortable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say at this point it is most important for you to identify exactly what behaviors are making you uncomfortable. It could just be him hitting on you, but oftentimes that behavior is accompanied by other actions that could contribute to the discomfort as well, e.g. being passive-aggressive when you shut down his attempts or unwanted forms of physical affection. There is a laundry list of possibilities, and identifying these behaviors will make it easier for you to articulate the situation and how it has created an unsustainable work environment for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I usually err on the side of confrontation, I think in situations like these direct confrontation is not always the best option for everyone. I would, however, advise you to tell someone who has the power to change the situation, even if it isn’t your boss directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In every workplace there should  be someone who is responsible for handling these situations. Normally, this person works in the human resources (HR) department; however, if you are unsure who specifically handles these situations, the HR department is a good place to start. Whomever you end up speaking with should be able to explain all of your options and help you decide what is best for you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think confronting your boss is the best option, make sure you are clear about which behaviors make you uncomfortable. This should not come off as a threat, but your boss should know that if his behavior doesn’t stop you will have to speak with someone else. This is never an easy thing to do, but remember that being comfortable in your workplace is not a privilege but a right.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d3413dcc208f1ace614a73bb57bc079?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d3413dcc208f1ace614a73bb57bc079?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/aj/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">AJ</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>AJ is the advice guru of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em>If you know who she is, keep it to yourself.

At the ripe age of 18 I thought sex was not only something quintessential to the college experience but also to being a Gaucho, and it wasn’t just because of the shameful amount of times I’ve seen “American Pie.” Two and a half years later, here I am being reprimanded by a frat star for not wanting to be exclusive.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB carries on a reputation of one-night stands and unprotected sex, but the reality for many people is that they’re in search of something more. That is why it is important to remember that despite “norms” or assumed expectations, at the end of the day any level of intimacy must be on the terms of your partner and you. Figure out what you want out of a relationship. That could be anything from knowing you want to get married and have five kids after dating six months to knowing you exclusively want to have one-night stands. Defining for yourself what you want will help you avoid a potentially negative or even harmful situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to the physicality of hooking up, make sure you know your boundaries, what you are comfortable with and what you are willing to try, and be sure to have communicated with your partner about their boundaries as well. Remember that while hookup culture on a college campus can be uniquely lecherous, it can also be surprisingly insightful. Keeping open lines of communication can not only help keep you safe, but it can also allow you to more comfortably explore your sexual boundaries as well.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">♥</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How do I stay faithful to my long-distance boyfriend? It’s so hard sometimes!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I do believe everyone is capable of maintaining a long-distance relationship, I do not believe long-distance relationships are for everyone, for a variety of different reasons. That being said, I believe the first step to being faithful in a long-distance relationship is ensuring that both your partner and you are 100 percent committed to the relationship as it is. Relationships in and of themselves are difficult, and being physically separated only adds to the opportunities for confusion, miscommunication and stress. If both of you are not committed to one another and to addressing your issues as they arise, I don’t believe it would be worth it to stay together because you will just be hurting one another in the long run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you and your boyfriend have discussed your commitment to one another, I think it would be beneficial to set aside a few times a week when you will Facetime or have a phone call with each other. Obviously you can talk more than what is scheduled, but ensuring that you have dedicated time to each other regularly is a more tangible representation of your commitment that will help you both stay connected. I also think that it is important for your partner and you to discuss how you will handle conflict when it arises. Whether you decide to address it immediately or to give yourselves a few days before discussing, putting a concrete plan in place will help you avoid simply putting issues off that could be detrimental to the relationship. Long-distance relationships may be the ultimate test of a relationship, but keep in mind why you’re staying committed and that the distance is only temporary.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">♥</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Hi AJ – how do I tell my best friend I’ve been in love with her for five years? I don’t think I can stay silent anymore :(</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falling in love with your best friend to some extent seems almost inevitable. Despite all efforts to maintain a completely platonic relationship, the lines of intimacy blur when you love someone. She knows you love her, but she doesn’t know the way you love her. You have to be completely honest with her and also with yourself. What is it that you want from the relationship and what are your intentions in telling her? While I do believe you should be honest with her about your feelings, that does not necessarily mean that you have the intention of changing the relationship right now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When friendship turns into something more, I think there is always the fear of losing the relationship. Keep in mind that this may catch her off-guard or she may not even skip a beat. Regardless, you should let her know that you care about her and that you want to communicate about how the feelings may affect your relationship. In the chance that the feelings aren’t reciprocated, remember that it is OK to take some time to process and move forward, but that you should let her know what you need to continue the relationship as friends.</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

How do I get him to stop?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welp… I’m going to have to say there is no way to stop your roommate from watching copious amounts of porn; however, the noise pollution is definitely something that is more up for discussion. If by some miniscule chance your roommate is living in a state of oblivion and consequently unaware of the fact that you know he’s watching porn, then I would say you should let him know you are VERY aware of that fact. The oblivious roommate, while sometimes annoying, will often change their behavior once they’re told their actions are disturbing the peace of others, within a reasonable amount that is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If, however, your roommate is shamelessly aware of the fact that all of Isla Vista knows he’s spanking the monkey — *insert favorite masturbation euphemism* — then you’ll probably have to address this issue from the position of a roommate and not a friend (assuming you two are friends). While I am one to support most (nearly all) expressions of physical exploration and desire, and I think it’s important to respect the expressions of others, the shared space must be respected first. Whether he masturbates once a day or his hand never leaves his pants, if he’s making a noticeable amount of noise, you can tell him that you find it bothersome. If a roommate were playing music too loudly, most people wouldn’t hesitate to ask them to turn it down. While this situation is slightly more sensitive, I would venture to say your roommate may understand how you could be uncomfortable. The bottom line is that you guys should set boundaries and expectations, whether that is him reducing his noise level or even you leaving your schedule so he knows when he can be loud. At the very least, he owes you some high-quality ear plugs.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p><b>How do I come out as bisexual?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I have to preface this answer, like many others, with transparency about my identity and experiences. As a cis-gendered, heterosexual female the scope of my knowledge is limited to my observations, interactions, and what I have read. That being said, there are still many facets of sexuality that I have yet to even begin thinking about let alone try to understand, but I hope that in questioning my own perceptions and learning about others’ experiences I can find some ground of understanding and explanation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though in hindsight it seems so apparent, it wasn’t until it was pointed out to me that I understood there is not a *right* way to come out. The subjectivity of the answers to questions I had asked myself in thinking about sexuality necessitates a solution that could not possibly be singular. For me, this begs the question of where validity and acceptance of different sexualities lies in our community as well as in other aspects of your life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world has critiqued us endlessly as cultures within communities perpetuate both overt and more subtle forms of prejudice, and each identity has faced the consequences. The denial and erasure of bisexuality has in many ways affected individuals’ willingness to come out. Whether or not your family, friends, and peers are accepting, questioning and denial are often times at the forefront of discussion: “Are you sure you’re not just confused?,” “You’re a girl dating a man but you identify as bi? Does that identity even affect you?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember you are coming out for you and nobody else. You know that your sexuality is valid, and your feelings are real. There will be people that won’t support you but find strength and compassion with the ones who do and develop a support system with them. Coming out will be a process and you will probably find yourself coming out several times because your sexuality isn’t determined by the gender of your partner. In talking with your partners, it is always important to keep open lines of communication. Eventually, you may become more and more familiar with how certain reactions make you feel and it is important to discuss and process those feelings in each new relationship because they may vary from person to person. At times this process will wear on you, but always remember you can do this and you are not alone.</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

boyfriend and I have been dating for about a month (we had been friends since the start of Fall Quarter). I have a feeling that he’s about to say “I love you” soon. He goes on long rants about things he loves about me but stops just short of saying “I love you.” Unfortunately, I don’t feel the same way. I think I could love him if I had more time, but I don’t want it to affect our relationship if I don’t say “I love you” back in that moment. Do I lie or tell the truth? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming to this point in a relationship is difficult when the feelings aren’t completely mutual especially when you’re anticipating unreciprocated feelings. There isn’t a strict timeline in terms of a relationship, but I would say that one month is a relatively short period of time to expect someone to be sure of love. I definitely don’t think you should tell him you love him until that is the way you feel, and I think lying to him would hurt him more than anything. But to that end you shouldn’t feel like you have a reason to lie. It is 100 percent okay not to be experiencing those feelings yet, the important thing to let him know is that you do really care about him and although you don’t love him, it isn’t a matter of your relationship but a matter of time. We all develop and experience feelings differently and there is no reason for him to be hurt that you don’t have the exact same timeline as him.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Hi AJ – my boyfriend is trying to grow a beard, and it’s not looking too good.

Some guys will be offended, but you could remind them it’s probably better for their wellbeing (and yours). If you think he’ll be really offended you could take the angle of telling him how good he looks clean shaven or with stubble. That way it’s not really negatively directed.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How do I get my boyfriend to eat my ass? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating ass… that’s a tricky one. It’s definitely one of those things you’ve gotta go all in for. Personally, I think if you want your ass eaten, honesty is the best policy. I don’t think there is any way to subtly discuss this topic, not that you should discuss any aspect of your romantic relationships subtly. Because you are dating this person, I think it’s important for your boyfriend to know how much it’s something you want to explore because unless you’re in a polyamorous relationship, no one else but your boyfriend should be eating your ass. Also, give your boyfriend sometime to think it over. He may say no at first and then eventually come around to the idea after you talk about it some more. Don’t give up and keep that toosh clean!</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p><b>Will you marry me?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take me on a date first and we’ll see.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>★</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>I am having trouble finding a balance between going out and staying in. My friends go out five nights a week and I feel lame when I stay in (also #fomo) what should I do?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I definitely struggled with this when I came to college and I think a lot of students do as well. Personally, I think it is really important to establish what your priorities are. In the back of my mind I constantly remind myself why I came to college and that it is a privilege to be here. Academics are extremely important, and you have to really know yourself and what you need in order to feel successful. That being said, there is more to college than hitting the books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many people, coming to college is the first time they truly have any sort of independence. To some extent, you could be doing whatever the hell you’d like. While that does sound a little extreme, it’s definitely something to take advantage of. Right now I would say your lifestyle and your body are at a point where they can handle the extremes. However, going out five nights a week really isn’t sustainable for many people. I think going out that much is something to try for a short period of time, but after awhile I do think you could get bored among other things. Also, FOMO is for sure real, but more likely than not when you go out you’ll be going to the same types of parties with the same people listening to the same music drinking the same shitty Vitali and that’s nothing to sweat over missing out on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going out is important, but like you’re saying, balance is key. I would pick two to three nights a week to go out on so you get your time to have fun, but also know you’ll be able to handle your workload. And always remember: TREAT YO SELF!</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

How do I tell my girlfriend that she’s bad at eating me out? How can I help her get better?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigating the physical aspects of a relationship can often seem more daunting and confusing than other parts. There are so many levels of vulnerability when it comes to physical relationships that the fear hurting, confusing or even embarrassing our partner can stop us from addressing an issue or feeling. That being said, it is important to remember that the advice I am giving you is very general and that you know your girlfriend as well as your relationship with her more than I do so use your best judgment when trying to determine how she will react to certain things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would stray from telling her she is bad at eating you out and try to frame it in a way that is focused on you: for example, you could tell her that you really like when she does one thing over another or even show her what feels good for you. From my experience, when I have been with someone who doesn’t know what feels good for me, showing or helping them goes a long way. Additionally, if you ask your girlfriend what feels good for her, it can help alleviate some of the pressure she may feel from trying to pleasure you. I have also found that being responsive to a partner can be very encouraging. You could moan or tell your girlfriend it feels good which will help reinforce more of the positive actions.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a reminder, sex is not what this culture has made it out to be and to that end it is certainly not what we see in the movies. There is so much pressure to have these magical, perfect, orgasmic if you will hookups on the first try, but that is so unrealistic. It takes time and communication to become familiar with your partner’s body. You could have a ton of amazing sex with one partner yet be far from getting another partner there. I believe that a good sexual partner hasn’t necessarily had copious amounts of sex or had an extensive list of sexual partners but is aware of their partner and how what they’re doing makes them feel. Reassure your girlfriend of these things and make sure she knows that you’re in this together.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>🝊</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Hi AJ! There’s a cute guy who works at the Starbucks in the UCen. How do I ask him out in the right way without making him feel pressured?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow meet cute of the quarter for sure &lt;3 Just as a preface, I think this is one of those times you’ve got to be prepared to go all in. Because he works at the UCen Starbucks, you run the risk of having to see him again even if things don’t work out. While I have full faith and confidence in you, this possibility is something to keep in mind but not something that should keep you from asking him out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, I would write the following message on a napkin and give it to one of the other baristas to give to him:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His name, Coffee date?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Your full name, your phone number”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you don’t stay in there after giving the napkin to the barista. This way, he has your name, your number, knows you’re interested and is in a relatively lower pressure situation than if you were to say something to him. Now he has time to do all of the necessary creeping on your social media and let you know when he wants to meet up with you :) SHOOT YO SHOT BABYYYY.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>🝊</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>I can’t kick my coffee addiction. Help!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re anything like me, caffeine has become imperative to life as a college student. Between academics, work, some semblance of a social life and crippling procrastination, coffee became my crutch. If it’s the coffee you’re trying to cut and not necessarily the caffeine, I would suggest switching to a tea. However, if you’re trying to lower your caffeine intake, I would definitely try to reduce your “need” for caffeine by adjusting your sleep schedule and depleting your dependency by only drinking caffeine when you absolutely need it. Making an effort to get at least eight hours of sleep per night has changed my life. I have seen noticeable differences in my focus, retention and productivity in addition to reducing the amount of caffeine I consume.

What’s the most health-conscious and environmentally-friendly way to get high without one?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorry to hear about your bong. I gotta say, bringing a bong to a dayger is a risky move, but more power to you, fellow Isla Vistan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given my inexperience with weed, I took to reading some health-conscious, eco-friendly stoner blogs and have come across a few suggestions. Aside from using a bong, it sounds like edibles are the way to go in terms of health if you’re concerned about possible respiratory side effects. However, if you’re watching your weight, eating a bunch of pot brownies probably isn’t ideal. In that case, I would say vaporizing your cannabis is better.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456813/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">initial literature</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on vaporization suggests that vaporizing, unlike smoking, heats up the plant to a temperature where it doesn’t combust. In other words, vaporizing reduces exposure to the gaseous toxins associated with combustion of cannabis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as eco-friendly smoking goes on an individual basis, there were limited comments and conclusions about the actual method of smoking, but more about the ways in which you could reduce your “cannabis carbon footprint.” Recycling your weed bottles and vaporizer batteries, using non-toxic glass cleaner and actually throwing away your roaches are a few simple ways you can be more environmentally conscious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just food for thought:</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While recycling and non-toxic glass cleaner are great, it may also be a good idea to consider the</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/20/cannabis-climate-change-fossil-fuels\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impact</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of corporate weed industry on the environment, but that’s for another article.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✸</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How do you properly ask a guy out since it’s kind of awkward because guys are supposed to ask girls?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chivalry is dead and you are a strong, independent woman capable of asking this lucky mans on a date! Whether a girl or a guy is making the first move, the uncertainty of asking someone out is usually awkward or a little stressful. If you’re nervous, I would start by asking him to get coffee with you sometime. Getting coffee isn’t too fancy and allows you to be in a public space where you can get to know each other on a more personal level. To that end, sometimes getting coffee can be kind of ambiguous in terms of intentions, so I would say after you get coffee (and hopefully by this point you’ve exchanged numbers) make sure he knows what your intentions are. You can do this!</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✸</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>So I’m gay, and there’s this cute guy on my floor and not so sure if he’s gay. Should I talk to him? How?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My initial reaction was to tell you to absolutely make some moves! Talking to someone you’re attracted to whether physically or intellectually is intimidating amongst other feelings of anxiety, but that interaction can do a lot for you. You could quickly find out this person isn’t someone you want to be involved with, or you could end up becoming close friends with them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then I started to question my own advice. All of my thoughts have been based on my own experiences, and I think it would be heteronormative of me to assume that you would be in the same position as I would be in trying to talk to someone romantically.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This question actually really got me thinking about sexuality and romantic interactions. As someone who is cishet, I have to admit I haven’t spent enough time thinking about queer sexual experiences, and concerning this question specifically, I haven’t thought about how navigating relationships would be different.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think about talking to someone I’m interested in, I assume they’re hetero, and from my experience when I’ve been wrong I have been faced with nothing but kindness. For some reason – **<em>cough cough heteronormativity and toxic masculinity</em>** – if you were to assume someone was queer, there’s a chance that their response could be extremely negative – god forbid a straight, cis-gendered, testosterone-filled man is thought to be gay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an ideal world, if this guy turns out to be hetero he would just tell you he wasn’t interested, but there is part of me that fears that he could treat you terribly. That being said I wish you resilience, I wish you love and I wish you the kindness that everyone deserves.

How do I get over it? </b><b><i>-Seeking Casper</i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of how a relationship ended, it is always difficult to get over someone you have been intimately involved with. That being said, moving on will take time; however, I think the most important thing for you to know is that when someone ghosts they are being careless and actively choosing to disregard your emotions. People who ghost are normally trying to avoid their own emotional discomfort, but in doing so they have selfishly neglected to think about the other person involved. Unless you have very explicitly given them some reason to stop all forms of communication with you, there is no justification for ghosting. Keep in mind that you deserve better, and someone who does care about you (someone worth being with) will communicate their feelings to you regardless of what they are.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">♥</span></p>\n<p><b>I’m unhappy in my current relationship, and I know it needs to end, but Valentine’s Day is coming up. Is it better to break up before or after? </b><b><i>-V Stressed for V-Day</i></b><b>  </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think if you are certain you want to break up with your significant other, it’s better to have the conversation earlier. Breakups are usually never without hurt, but spending Valentine’s Day together as if you were happy and then breaking up immediately following Valentine’s Day is confusing and could potentially lead to more pain in the end. On the other hand, if you are still considering breaking up with your S.O. but you’re not certain, I would say wait until after Valentine’s Day to express how you’ve been feeling and give your partner the opportunity to have a conversation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember — there are healthy, respectful, caring ways to go through a breakup with a partner, but it does require some active thinking.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">♥</span></p>\n<p><b>I accidentally hooked up with the same person as my friend … How do I navigate this situation? </b><b><i>-Copycat Catie</i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should probably take advantage of this pristine opportunity to have a threesome. However, if that’s not your style at the moment, you should first try to evaluate the situation: Is your friend still hooking up with this person? Are you planning on hooking up with this person again? What is the status of the relationship between your friend and the other person? I have always found that the best way to avoid conflict is to be transparent; be honest about how you feel and ask questions when you’re unsure. While there are many aspects of relationships that are out of your control, you can choose to create a space for you, your friends and your lovers where you are free to talk about anything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve thought through what you want from the relationship with the person you hooked up with, it should be easier to start a conversation with your friend. Regardless of whether or not it was a one-time thing or you plan to marry this person, you should tell your friend. If you’re not convinced, think about how your friend would feel if they had to find out from someone else. At that point it could seem like you’re trying to hide it, and we all know that is a difficult hole to dig yourself out of. Think about what you want, and talk to your friend!</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">♥</span></p>\n<p><b>I have a crush on my friend in my same organization. Is it worth risking our friendship and the structure of our org to tell them how I feel? </b><b><i>-Org-y</i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of things to be said about hooking up with or pursuing a romantic relationship with someone from your friend group or organization. It is important to KNOW THYSELF, or at least (since everyone believes they are the one human exempt from their own biases and tendencies) know the person you’re interested in. Not all people are able to handle the very possible uncomfortable outcomes of org-cest, and that is okay. Navigating a relationship with someone from the friend group and especially with someone from within an organization takes open communication and maturity. Before you decide whether or not to make those moves, decide whether or not you are willing to commit to the amount of communication it takes to preserve enough of a relationship to stay friends or work together. I would encourage you to talk to the other person about boundaries and whether or not they are willing to talk to you even if things don’t work out. Just saying you will be “friends no matter what” isn’t enough </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually talk through the possibilities.
