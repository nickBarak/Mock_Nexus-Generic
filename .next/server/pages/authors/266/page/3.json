While watching the fire, the officers observed an unidentified male approach and kick the frame, causing half of it to fall away from the fire and continue smoking.</p>\n<p>The officers then observed a 24-year-old male walk up, lift up part of the frame and throw it back onto the fire. The officers contacted the suspect and placed him under arrest for fueling a fire.</p>\n<p>While returning to the IVFP station, the suspect apologized for fueling the fire and told the officers, “This was a stupid thing to do,” and “I was trying to impress a girl.” When the officers told the suspect they were going to be completely honest with him, he said, “Since you are being honest with me, I want to be honest with you; I have some marijuana in my jacket pocket.”</p>\n<p>Upon arrival at the IVFP station, the officers recovered a clear plastic baggie of marijuana from the suspect’s left-side jacket pocket.</p>\n<p>The suspect was issued a citation for fueling a fire and possession of less than one ounce of marijuana. He was cited and released; the marijuana was taken as evidence.</p>\n<p><b>Close Only Counts in Horseshoes and Hand Grenades</b><br>\nAt approximately 12:05 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 17, IVFP officers patrolling the intersection of Camino del Sur and Sabado Tarde Road observed a 19-year-old male staggering westbound on Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP reports, as the suspect was walking, he picked up a plastic cup in the roadway and threw it at the vehicle driving on Camino del Sur, just missing it. When the officers contacted the suspect, they noticed he had red watery eyes, an unsteady gait and a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his person.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Goodness Gracious, Great Ball of Fire</b><br>\nAt approximately 1:50 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 18, IVFP officers patrolling the 6500 block of Pardall Road observed a ball 8 inches in diameter, made of a metal frame covered in cloth, on fire in the middle of the road.</p>\n<p>Reports state the officers saw a 21-year-old male walk up to the ball, grab it, spin it in a circle several times and throw it, causing flaming cloth and debris to be flung into the street.</p>\n<p>When confronted by the officers, the suspect said, “I was just moving it out of the street.” The ball was still in the middle of the street and was no closer to being out of the road.</p>\n<p>The fire department responded and put out the fire. When the officers asked the suspect why, if he wanted to help, he did not call the fire department, the suspect said, “I’m not obligated to.” The suspect had red watery eyes, and was confused when given simple instructions.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><i>– Compiled from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Reports by Jennifer B.
