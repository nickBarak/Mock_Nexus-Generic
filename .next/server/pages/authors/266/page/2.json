Not surprisingly, the 19-year-old possessed many of the symptoms of heavy intoxication.</p>\n<p>The deputy, relatively unscathed from his run-in with the bike, immediately told the reckless rider to park it on the curb, but the young man would not. After several attempts at ordering him to sit down, the officer had to physically assist him to the curb.</p>\n<p>After finally succeeding in seating the BMX bomber, the deputy was able to assess the situation. He first noticed that the young man was not wearing a shoe on his right foot, a sign of having too much to drink.</p>\n<p>The young man told the officer he had taken three shots earlier in the night, but after failing to complete his ABC’s, he was arrested for public intoxication. In response, the recently arrested cyclist repeatedly told the deputy that he had just been trying to get home and that everything was an “accident.”</p>\n<p>Accident or not, crashing into a police officer while riding a bike is never going to turn out well, and in this case the young man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Where Did You Sleep Last Night?<br>\nSun., Sept. 7, 6:47 a.m.-Deputies working the morning shift received a call concerning a young man passed out on a sidewalk near the intersection of Camino Pescadero and El Greco roads.</p>\n<p>Two officers responded to the call and immediately found the 18-year-old sleeping peacefully on the concrete. He was fully dressed, but the fresh morning light revealed that his t-shirt was covered in what appeared to be his own vomit.</p>\n<p>One of the deputies walked up to the sidewalk sleeper and said, “Police, wake up,” in a low, police-like voice, but the sleeping beauty did not rouse. However, after a little shaking, the young man eventually sat up.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the severely confused man if he knew where he was, but he simply looked up at the deputy with a blank stare on his face.</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked if he knew where he lived, and he responded by saying he lived on “DP.” When asked where on Del Playa, he just shrugged his shoulders and did not respond.</p>\n<p>The SBCC student was then asked if he had too much to drink the night before and he, as anyone who wakes up on a sidewalk should, nodded his head in agreement.</p>\n<p>“Would you like to go to jail?” asked the deputy, and the young man once again nodded his head in agreement. Not wishing to disappoint, the officer arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Breaking and Entering (and Sleeping?)<br>\nMon., Sept. 15, 5:14 a.m.-A deputy was dispatched to 6661 Berkshire Terrace on a report of an intoxicated male trying to unlawfully gain entry into an apartment.</p>\n<p>When the officer arrived he contacted a resident of the apartment, who said that she had been sleeping on the living room couch when an unidentified male climbed through the front window and “passed out” on the floor. When asked if she knew the squatter, she said “no” and that she wanted him gone.</p>\n<p>The deputy walked into the apartment and saw the 21-year-old UCSB student fast asleep on the living room floor. He had on a collared shirt, a pair of underwear and nothing else. His pants were soaking wet with what no doubt was his own urine, and his shoes were laying haphazardly on the kitchen floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy shook the young man awake, but he was too disoriented to cooperate. He did not know where he was, or where he lived. When he tried to stand, he nearly fell over.</p>\n<p>The officer told the floor moocher that he was not welcome there, and the confused man walked to his pants and attempted to put the urine soaked denim back on, but was unable to and instead placed them back down on the floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy again told him that he was not wanted, but the piss-soaked sleeper mumbled something incoherent and continued to walk aimlessly around the living room.</p>\n<p>Clearly incapable of taking care of himself, he was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>-Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/","id":3886,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3885,3884,3883],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-08-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Loitering in the Streets with Demons Sun., Aug. 2, 2:47 a.m. — Officers working the late shift received a call concerning a man loitering at the 7-Eleven convenience store on Hollister Avenue.

The man was quick to answer: “God,” he told the officer.</p>\n<p>Unfazed, the officer asked what the man was doing. “Purples fives in my eyes,” he replied.</p>\n<p>The psychedelic poet continued, uttering more strange answers when questioned. When asked his address, he mentioned a “Thermo Nuclear Device” and at one point began speaking in numbers.</p>\n<p>And when he wasn’t articulating the outlandish and bizarre, he would stand with his eyes closed and refuse to answer any questions.</p>\n<p>The officer could not detect the presence of alcohol, but judging from his weird behavior, arrested the 35-year old man for public intoxication of a controlled substance and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Angels in the Bike Rack</b><br>\n<i>Tues., July 29, 9:44 a.m. —</i> Officers on a patrol down Embarcadero Del Norte came across a young woman passed out between a pair of bikes parked in front of Freebirds.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the sidewalk sleeper and observed that she had soiled her pants and had what appeared to be dried spit and leftover food on her chin.</p>\n<p>When the officers awoke the weeknight reveler, she was extremely disoriented. She could not remember her own name and told the deputies she was at her home in Agoura Hills, Calif., some 70 miles from Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the officer was skeptical of her story, she added that she was “walking home” to Agoura Hills with her friend. When asked what friend she was walking with, the 23-year-old woman pointed towards the sky and said “him.”</p>\n<p>However, the deputy knew that not even holy providence could have steered the drunk woman home that night. Instead, he arrested and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Doggie Heaven or Just the Dog House?</b><br>\n<i>Sun., July 20, 2:43 a.m. —</i> Residents of 6744 Sabado Tarde Rd. contacted the Isla Vista Foot Patrol to report an unknown female wandering around their front yard, barefoot.</p>\n<p>When the deputies contacted the 22-year-old woman, she was unable to speak coherently or provide answers to simple questions such as her name or address.</p>\n<p>Additionally, her face was covered in what appeared to be mud, and when the officers stood a little closer, they were overwhelmed by the familiar smell of vomit and alcohol.</p>\n<p>When asked why she was in a stranger’s yard, she informed the deputies that she was trying to locate her missing dog. There was one slight problem with her story, however: Her dog lived with her parents in the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>The officer decided to let the dog story slide, and again asked the young woman where she lived. She began uttering numbers, but the deputy eventually discovered she was simply reciting a phone number.</p>\n<p>Hoping for at least one legitimate answer, the officer then asked the barefoot, mud-covered, vomit-reeking loiterer for her phone number, but she replied by repeatedly saying her last name.</p>\n<p>Clearly unable to care for herself, the officer arrested the severely confused woman, and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/","id":3885,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3884,3883,3882],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Blazing Saddles Mon., May 26, 12:03 a.m. – Deputies in a marked police car came across a truck parked in a fire lane on Seville Road.

Unable to conduct a stop due to traffic, the deputies followed the vehicle, which eventually made a right onto El Colegio Road and then a left onto Stadium Road.</p>\n<p>As the truck turned onto Stadium Road, the driver crossed the double yellow lines, prompting the deputies to pull him over.</p>\n<p>While standing at the driver’s side window, the officer immediately detected the pungent odor of burnt marijuana emanating from within the truck. The deputy asked if there was any pot in the car and the driver admitted that he and his passengers had hot-boxed the truck earlier that evening. He then assured the officer there wasn’t anymore weed – or at least he couldn’t remember there being anymore.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old male then produced a brightly colored pipe, complete with burnt residue. The driver told the deputies the piece belonged to his passenger, however the man riding shotgun was unable to produce a valid medical marijuana card.</p>\n<p>The driver was then asked to step out of the truck while an officer checked the vehicle for any hidden drugs. Unfortunately for this stoner, the floor beneath the passenger seat just wasn’t a good hiding spot and, after a short search, the deputy produced a small baggie containing less than an ounce of weed.</p>\n<p>The red-eyed Rasta was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of a controlled substance and was required to pee into a cup. He was later released into the care of his sober passenger, pending a later court date.</p>\n<p>Brown-Bagging It<br>\nTues., May 27, 4:28 p.m. – Officers on an afternoon patrol received a complaint of an intoxicated subject disturbing pedestrians in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, deputies spotted a 47-year-old male staggering about the park, yelling at an innocent bystander. As if his actions – and his breath – weren’t tips enough, the belligerent day-drinker was also toting a 40-shaped brown paper bag.</p>\n<p>The officer told the man to take a seat, but before obliging, the drunkard poured out his beer and tossed the bottle behind him. Dutifully, the deputy went to fetch the litter.</p>\n<p>The officer placed the bottle back in front of the elderly drunk, only to have him pick it up and throw it once more.</p>\n<p>Deciding it was best to just leave the bottle as is, the deputy asked the man – whose eyes were bloodshot and watering – how much alcohol he had consumed. The man yelled back, “I don’t care. Take me to jail.”</p>\n<p>The deputy didn’t have to be told twice. He arrested the man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/","id":3872,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3871,3870,3869],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Trail Needs Dusting: A Nexus Goodbye","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I've learned a lot of things in the past four years and many of them I learned while working at one of the best damned college papers in the state.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I’ve learned a lot of things in the past four years and many of them I learned while working at one of the best damned college papers in the state. So, rather than boring you with my philosophies on life and journalism, I’ve decided to share with you all at least a few of those things:</p>\n<p>1) Parents of incoming freshmen are really, really nervous. Oh, and sex columns scare the crap out of them.<br>\n2) Albino raccoons are invading Isla Vista. When good ol’ Albert Raccoon bit the dust last year, we thought we had seen the last of El Blanco, but we were wrong. Dead wrong. Okay, not dead wrong. At any rate, I’m taking credit for naming the celebrated I.V. mascot since I dubbed him Albert in our April Fool’s issue many moons ago. Deal with it, Facebook.<br>\n3) Associated Students elections are fierce and scary. Sometimes when I log on GOLD at night, I can still hear the screaming…<br>\n4) The Daily Nexus is the best place to work on campus.</p>\n<p>We’ve had quite the year, gang. The Daily Nexus got a front-page makeover, feature stories and a science page; our Web site got ads, videos and comment boards; UCTV made a documentary about us; we had some amazing news coverage – hello, does Hillary Clinton ring a bell? – and we took home several awards, including the honor of being named one of the top three college newspapers in the state. Oh yeah, and we stopped two subpoenas.

Both of you have really pulled through this year and I thank you kindly. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Aria Miran: I can’t believe you are hanging around I.V. for another year. I’m warning freshmen parents about you. Seriously, though, you have led your news desk to glory this year and we’ve had some awesome times together. I have no regrets.</p>\n<p>Jessica Mullen and Mackenzie Weinger: You write some amazing and well-researched stories and it’s always fun to watch you get excited. I am so very proud of you two and I will miss you both. Give ’em hell.</p>\n<p>Erin Currie: I thought we fired you! Ok, ok. You can keep your job. Erin, I think it’s fair to say that you are one of the nicest and most humble persons in this office. Please, don’t change!</p>\n<p>Patty Bobek and C.K. Hickey : You always come into work with a smile on your faces and you’ve handled some difficult situations with the opinion page this past year. Patty, you’ve truly encouraged me to always do more and, C.K., I suspect you are Superman, but I guess I’ll never know … I put Kryptonite in your hookah.</p>\n<p>Chris Hoffman and Alex Pavlovic: If there’s anything I’ll remember, it’s Chris’s mischievous grin and Alex’s sly-guy wit. You have rocked the world of sports this year and your columns kick ass. Call me when you make it to ESPN.</p>\n<p>Mollie Vandor and Tyler Vickers: The woman who takes shit from no one and the nicest guy in the office. You two are truly a force to be reckoned with. You guys know what you want and you take it.</p>\n<p>Erin Saldana and Rickey Mizuno: Where’s Erin? I can’t find Erin? Oh, there she is. As our pint-sized photographer you took some beautiful shots this year, and Rickey, you were always there for us when we needed you. You also make a damn fine drink. With that, I leave you with Erin’s favorite word: Chupacabra.</p>\n<p>Simon Estrada and Rick Martinez: You are so damned talented. Every time I find a piece of art I like in the paper, it usually tends to be yours, and I like the way you push your artists to excel. I see great things in your future.</p>\n<p>Valerie Tidwell, Melissa Davis, Noel Woodward, Rachel Lorencz, Virginia Yapp, and the rest of Copy: I regret that I do not have enough space to give thanks to each and every one of you. Please know that your willingness to endure some of those late nights has always left me in awe of you all.</p>\n<p>Kelly O’Halloran and Kera Zacuto: You guys made On the Menu the best section it could possibly be. Never has this section looked so beautiful. I thank you very much for you hard work.</p>\n<p>Nicki Arnold: You are too cool and I was lucky to have you by my side when I was opinion editor. I’m so glad you came back this year. You are the little sister I always wish I had.</p>\n<p>Nikki Moore, Craig Calkins and Dana Olsen: You guys may have left your desks a little early, but you never left my mind. It’s been fun growing up with you at the Nexus and I hope to run into you again post-graduation.</p>\n<p>Dan Gruen, Ryan Moll, Steve Placial: Video guys! You have helped make our vision a reality. You have formed the basis of what will likely become an integral part of the Web site. Thank you so much!</p>\n<p>Barb MacLean and J.E. Anderson: You have been my guiding lights over the past four years and you have contributed to this paper far more than you can imagine. You two are the hardest-working people we have.</p>\n<p>Jerry Roberts, Linda Meyer and Carol Dermer: I don’t know how you do it, but you do it with style. Thanks for balancing our books and selling those ads. I have a feeling the future looks very bright for the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, David Ferry: You have a lot of potential, my friend. If you stay focused, you’ll more than likely outdo your predecessors as editor in chief, and I expect that you will. Thus, I leave you with the words that I was given upon taking the paper’s top spot: A year from now, this will all seem funny.</p>\n<p>Adios, amigos!</p>\n<p>–Nick Dürnhöfer<br>\n–Daily Nexus<br>\n–Editor in Chief 2007-2008</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16869\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16869\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/","id":3570,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3569,3568,3567],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Mon., May 5, 1:51 a.m. - Deputies on uniformed patrol were dispatched to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road to apprehend a man who was reported thrice that night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Three Strikes You’re Out<br>\nMon., May 5, 1:51 a.m. – Deputies on uniformed patrol were dispatched to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road to apprehend a man who was reported thrice that night.</p>\n<p>The officers were told that the man in question was incessantly banging on the door of his friend’s apartment, asking to speak with the friend about his own girlfriend.</p>\n<p>This was, however, not the first time the police were called with regards to the suspect’s obsessive desire to talk with or about his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>The 21-year-old’s friend had first called the police after the seemingly drunk man had scaled a wooden fence and started pounding on the sliding glass door of the apartment. By the time the officers had arrived, he had disappeared.</p>\n<p>The friend told the deputies he had allowed the man inside the apartment but that, once inside, his drunken friend started to verbally abuse his girlfriend and needed to be kicked out. It was at this point that he jumped the fence and started his assault on the sliding glass door.</p>\n<p>After avoiding the police, the man resumed his quest at the front door, prompting his friend to call the police a second time. When the deputies arrived, they heard the desperate man shouting, “Come on, man. I’m going to jail. Let me in!”</p>\n<p>The officers told the man to wait until he was sober to talk to his girlfriend and that he should go straight home, lest he be arrested for public intoxication. He agreed, telling the deputies that he would not be a problem anymore.</p>\n<p>Thinking he had given the Isla Vista Foot Patrol the slip, he returned a few minutes later to bang on the door a third time. The police met up with him in the parking lot behind the apartment and arrested him – ending his marathon of obnoxious knocking.</p>\n<p>He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Rambling Man<br>\nSat., May 3, 11:25 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive observed a man struggling to walk the line.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the 18-year-old male wove back and forth across the street, clearly intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The man then lost his balance and veered sidelong into a parked car. Unabashed, he continued on, but soon lost his balance again and fell into the next available parked car.</p>\n<p>The officers stopped the unsteady stroller, who could barely stand still without completely losing his poise.</p>\n<p>The deputies began to question him, but soon realized that along with his balance, the man had lost his ability to comprehend what was happening. He stood there with a blank expression on his face and was unable to focus on the deputy when addressed.</p>\n<p>The officer asked oblivious man where he had been headed, but when he tried to answer, his speech was nothing but a stream of incoherent ramblings. His words were horribly slurred and he could barely put together a sentence.</p>\n<p>The officers, convinced the confused wanderer was unable to get home safely, arrested him. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Marathon<br>\nSun., May 4, 2:20 p.m. – Officers taking a break in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Station on Pardall Road were interrupted by the loud remarks of two passersby.</p>\n<p>A 19-year old male and his friend walking eastbound down Pardall Road decided to tempt fate by loudly making snide remarks about Isla Vista’s finest as they passed the open door of the police station. Only, this pair of day drinkers made one glaringly obvious mistake: One of them had decided to drunkenly taunt the police with a red cup in his hand.</p>\n<p>The deputies, however, opted not to stop the pair and let them continue on their way, red cup and all.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for them, these two Sunday partiers apparently hadn’t gotten enough thrills on their first pass, because 20 minutes later they returned walking in the opposite direction – the red cup still firmly in hand.</p>\n<p>If the deputies still had reservations about stopping the two, they were wiped away when they heard their now incoherent remarks drift in through the open door.</p>\n<p>An officer stopped the cup-wielding man and asked him what it contained. The defeated daredevil confessed that he was carrying vodka and that he was only 19 years of age.</p>\n<p>When asked when he had begun his daytime drinking, the man proudly stated that he had been continuously drinking since the night before.</p>\n<p>Apparently unimpressed, the deputy arrested the man and had him transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/","id":3874,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3873,3872,3871],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Steak, Guacamole and a Deadly Weapon, Please Saturday, Feb. 23, 4:33 a.m. — Officers stationed at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office received an early-morning call concerning a man “passed ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Steak, Guacamole and a Deadly Weapon, Please<br>\nSaturday, Feb. 23, 4:33 a.m. — Officers stationed at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office received an early-morning call concerning a man “passed out drunk” in front of Freebirds.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived minutes later, the 19-year-old man was laying on the sidewalk in front of the door, vomiting.</p>\n<p>Apparently unable to keep down his drunchies, the man was also unable to tell his story.</p>\n<p>According to a witness, the man laying in a pool of his previous meal — queso-nacho-rito, anyone? — had walked into the popular burrito joint earlier carrying an open pocket knife.</p>\n<p>The man with the munchies did not threaten anyone with the knife — perhaps plastic knives just weren’t good enough for him — but, nonetheless, the witness had quickly taken the knife from the drunk.</p>\n<p>The deputies, determining that the man was too drunk even for Freebirds, called the paramedics, who transported the man to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Cross-fading the Night Away<br>\nSaturday, Feb. 23, 1:40 a.m. — Deputies patrolling the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road noticed a man having some difficulty putting one foot in front of the other sauntering down the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Officers continued to watch the man as he staggered from side to side. Judging from his apparent lack of balance, the deputies suspected the man was under the influence of a solid amount of alcohol. The fact that he was yelling at innocent passersby also helped the officers in the deduction.</p>\n<p>However, the 18-year-old man was not satisfied with his simple inebriation. Seemingly unaware of the deputies standing just paces away, the man asked aloud, “Do you know where I could score some weed?”</p>\n<p>Before he could ever get his answer, the pot-seeking soon-to-be-prisoner crossed paths with the police.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this drunken reveler did not spend the night blissfully forgetting where he put his belongings — deputies working the night shift at the Santa Barbara County Jail took care of that for him.</p>\n<p>My Name Is…<br>\nSunday, Feb. 24, 12:18 a.m. — Two males leaning against each other for support caught the attention of deputies patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>Officers spotted the 23-year-old man leaning head first against the outstretched arm of his comrade. The two, like drunken statues backlit by I.V.’s relentless debauchery, held this graceful posture for some time.</p>\n<p>But beauty is not meant to last and the two broke away and headed directly toward the officers, at which point the true extent of their intoxication came into clear focus.</p>\n<p>The deputies determined that the 23-year-old male was unable to care for himself and asked the man his name. He answered with his first name, but gave no hint of his surname.</p>\n<p>The deputies asked again several times, but the man simply smiled and shook his head, offering no answers. The officers asked him his date of birth and if he knew where he was, but with smiles abounding, he gave no answer.</p>\n<p>The deputies then asked if the man had his driver license, at which point he reached into his back pocket and produced his wallet.</p>\n<p>Yet, with his wallet out, the happy drunk was unable to find his license, even though it was clearly visible. The officer generously pointed it out to him, yet he was still unable to retrieve it.</p>\n<p>A smile goes a long way, however, and the deputies were kind enough to help the man out and retrieved his license for him.</p>\n<p>With the government-issued cheat sheet in hand, the severely confused man was still unable to provide officers with neither his last name nor his date of birth.</p>\n<p>The man was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending remembrance of his name.<br>\n— Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15994\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15994\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/","id":3875,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3874,3873,3872],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A-B-C, Easy as 1-2-3?\nSaturday, Jan. 12, 12:29 a.m. - On Embarcadero del Norte, a group of men yelling at each other attracted the attention of a large crowd, and, eventually, the Isla Vista Foot Patr...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A-B-C, Easy as 1-2-3?<br>\nSaturday, Jan. 12, 12:29 a.m. – On Embarcadero del Norte, a group of men yelling at each other attracted the attention of a large crowd, and, eventually, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>The officers spotted a 23-year-old man who had actually had a run-in with I.V.’s finest earlier that night. The reason: an inappropriate tirade of deafening insults.</p>\n<p>The man – who seemed to have his vocal dial turned up to 11 – told the deputies that he just wanted to go home, all the while trying to dip, duck and dodge the questions thrown his way.</p>\n<p>He managed to count how many shots he’d had that night – eight- but could not seem to remember his alphabet for the officers.</p>\n<p>After several earnest attempts, trying such letter combinations as the commonly mistaken “K-I-Z” and the just barely incorrect “U-P,” he admitted to the officers, “No, I cannot say my ABCs.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication, and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending successful completion of his 1-2-3s.</p>\n<p>She’s a Lady<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 1:21 a.m. – After receiving a call from residents on Camino del Sur that a woman was face down on the grass throwing up, an IVFP officer found the19-year-old.</p>\n<p>When the deputy approached the woman, she managed to compose herself enough to speak, and, as the officer noted, was exceedingly polite.</p>\n<p>Despite her good manners, the woman proved a bit untrustworthy. She told the officer that she had gone to a party with her friends, but that like all underage students at UCSB, she only drank water.</p>\n<p>The woman, who had soiled her jeans, repeatedly denied drinking any alcohol. Her story, however, proved about as watertight as a pasta strainer when a test administrated by the deputies showed her blood alcohol content level at .212.</p>\n<p>Once the woman realized she was caught in a lie, she apologized profusely for causing trouble and gracefully faced her night in jail, wet pants and all.</p>\n<p>Close Encounters of the Leafy Kind<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 12:52 a.m. – Officers patrolling Sabado Tarde Road saw a woman stumble down the street, lose her balance and run straight into a bush.</p>\n<p>Refusing to let a mere shrub get the best of her, the 19-year-old woman recovered, brushed away the stray twigs from her hair, and continued down the street.</p>\n<p>When confronted by the deputies, the woman said she was coming from a party on Sueno Road and that all she had to drink was a beer and a shot.</p>\n<p>The officer questioned the validity of her alcohol consumption, and asked the woman if she had any more to drink. She told him, “No, I really did not. I am just a lightweight.”</p>\n<p>When informed of her encounter with the foliage, the woman said she did not remember running into the bush, but reassured the officers that she had talked to many people that night.</p>\n<p>The officers – still on Sabado – asked the woman if she was aware of her surroundings. The woman told the deputies she was on El Nido Lane coming from Cordoba Road – negating both reality and what she had earlier told the officers.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and taken to the IVFP station. While in the interview room, she grew tired and fell asleep beneath the table.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15484\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-17/police-blotter-22/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15484\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-17/police-blotter-22/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-17/police-blotter-22/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-17/police-blotter-22/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-17/police-blotter-22/","id":3873,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3872,3871,3870],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sunday, Dec. 30, 9:00 p.m. - An officer performing a routine traffic stop at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar was rudely interrupted when a woman drunkenly stumbled between his...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Truth Will Set You Free-ish.<br>\nSunday, Dec. 30, 9:00 p.m. – An officer performing a routine traffic stop at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar was rudely interrupted when a woman drunkenly stumbled between his patrol vehicle and the other subject.</p>\n<p>The 26-year-old woman approached the officer – already busy protecting and serving – and began to spit out incomprehensible slurs.</p>\n<p>The officer put his former engagement on hold momentarily and turned to face the sloshed siren.

The officer kindly asked the woman to sit on the curb until he finished his prior engagement with the unfortunate driver.</p>\n<p>Having let the vehicle go, he turned to the woman and asked what she needed. The woman, apparently following George Washington’s famed maxim, replied, “I’m drunk, I’m not going to lie.” When asked just how much she had drunk, the woman continued to show her truthful side, confessing, “[A] lot.”</p>\n<p>“I drink too much,” she added.</p>\n<p>When asked to stand up, her bare feet were unable to provide the necessary balance and the officer decided to arrest her.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>See Spot Drink…</p>\n<p>Saturday, Dec. 29, 2:00 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 700 block of Camino del Sur happened across a woman screaming and waving her arm in the air with a man behind her holding on to her shoulder.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached in their patrol car, the male subject left the agitated woman behind and proceeded to walk in the opposite direction at a brisk pace, looking back once to check out the situation.</p>\n<p>The officer, fearing the man would flee, sprung to action, jumping out of the car while yelling at him to come back. He did, albeit not as briskly as before.</p>\n<p>The officer started slapping handcuffs onto the subject, suspecting a possible assault. Suddenly the officer noticed that the man’s arrest was angering the woman. “You’re fucking arresting him?” she screamed out in a slurred and incoherent voice.</p>\n<p>The officer turned his attention to the 19-year-old woman, who he quickly determined was heavily intoxicated. Further questioning revealed the underling reason for her highly agitated state. Ignoring all the officer’s questions, the woman instead asked him, “Is my dog hurt?”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the drunken canine lover’s responses continued to involve her dog, despite the absence of any furry friends within the area.</p>\n<p>Further inquiry into the subject revealed that the 21-year-old man was a co-worker of hers who had simply offered to walk his friend home. The alcohol, however, had apparently blacked out any concrete memory of where she lived and the two wandered up and down the entire length of Camino del Sur for nearly an hour before they stumbled upon Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she spent the night in the doghouse, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Transporter<br>\nTuesday, Jan. 1, 12:35 a.m. – Choosing to roost between a hard place and a bush, a 20-year-old female woke up for the first time in 2008 to the glare of a Foot Patrol flashlight.</p>\n<p>Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive came across a woman wedged between a tall bush and a parked truck, seemingly asleep yet still standing. Her belt was half off and she seemed to have lost her shoes.</p>\n<p>When approached by deputies, the motionless woman mumbled, “I’m not driving them home.” When asked what she was doing, she repeated, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>Officers informed her that her sleep aid – the truck next to her – was empty, and no one else was present. The distinct lack of anyone to drive did not quell her concern, however. When asked why her belt was half off, she announced, much to officers’ surprise, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the woman to step out from between the truck and the bush and onto the sidewalk. Balance, however, was not the would-be-driver’s forte, and she stumbled and fell into the officer’s arms.</p>\n<p>The sleepy souse had a few fresh scratches on her arm, but was unable to explain their presence to the officer, apparently forgetting her recent stint in a bush.</p>\n<p>The women was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/","id":3871,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3870,3869,3868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Maybe He Should Go Back to Sesame Street\nSunday, Oct. 7, 12:29 a.m. - Two deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw a man walking around the corner of an apartment complex while a seco...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Maybe He Should Go Back to Sesame Street<br>\nSunday, Oct. 7, 12:29 a.m. – Two deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw a man walking around the corner of an apartment complex while a second man played lookout so his companion could urinate.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached, the guard sounded the alarm, yelling repeatedly for his friend to stop peeing and zip up his pants.</p>\n<p>The word came too late and a deputy got to the pissing perpetrator before he even finished the task at hand.</p>\n<p>After the 19-year-old man finished, the officers took him to the curb, noticed a strong odor of alcohol and began questioning.</p>\n<p>The man told the officers that he was a student at Santa Barbara City College. The deputy told him that he himself was “a proud graduate of SBCC” and then asked the subject to repeat his ABC’s.</p>\n<p>The man did not seem to know the alphabet but happily repeated, “I’m from SBCC. I am a proud graduate.”</p>\n<p>He then told officers he lived at “R690” on “I.V. Cascadero. … Cascadero Estibero.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>14 Tequila, 15 Tequila, 16 Tequila… Sidewalk<br>\nThursday, Oct. 11, 10:52 a.m. – A deputy observed a 21-year-old man wobbling down Sabado Tarde Road when he stumbled on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>When he fell to the ground, a large half-empty bottle of Jose Cuervo flew out of his arms. Thankfully, it remained unbroken.</p>\n<p>The man’s lucky streak ended there, though, as the officer picked up and dumped out the tequila.</p>\n<p>The subject explained to the officer, “It’s okay for me to be drunk. I’m over 21.”</p>\n<p>Despite his age, the man was breaking two laws – possession of an open container of alcohol and obvious public intoxication – so the officer arrested him.</p>\n<p>While at the IVFP station waiting for transfer to jail, the man alternated between lying on the floor and sitting in the chair, apparently trying to find the most comfortable position.</p>\n<p>Soon the man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>I Would Walk 500 Miles… But Not with Her<br>\nThursday, Oct. 11, 12:40 a.m. – Officers standing on Camino del Sur observed a woman staggering northbound down the road, stumbling and walking into parked vehicles.</p>\n<p>An officer attempted to contact the 20-year-old woman, but she turned and ran away, but only for a brief moment. The fleeing fugitive managed to get less than half a block before the deputy detained her and placed her on the curb.</p>\n<p>During an intoxicating interrogation, the woman said she did not know where she lived and slurred out several incorrect addresses as she tried to identify her current location.</p>\n<p>While the woman said she had “nothing” to drink, she was uncooperative and combatant, and the deputy had to place her face down and cuff her.</p>\n<p>During the arrest, an unknown man, who was apparently a victim of the directionally challenged woman, thanked the officer for taking the loaded lady off his hands, saying, “We’ve been walking in circles for hours.”</p>\n<p>At the Isla Vista Foot Patrol station, an officer had to remove chairs from the booking room to keep her from climbing and stumbling over them.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Tourist Trap<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 13, 3:21 p.m. – A 20-year-old man was staggering around the 6500 block of DP, looking for Freebirds, when a deputy contacted him.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the man where he was going, to which the man replied, “I’m from San Diego, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>He then appeared as if he were about to topple over, so the deputy grabbed his arm to keep him on his feet.</p>\n<p>The man then told the officer that he had no friends in “I.P.” and had had eight beers that afternoon.</p>\n<p>For the man’s safety, he was arrested for public intoxication. He was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/","id":3862,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3861,3860,3859],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, My Friends","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Yes.

And what a year. Excuse me for taunting you with my superiority complex and self-fellating egoism, but this is the column to do it in. My goodbye column. My au revoir to the Daily Nexus. My exit stage left.</p>\n<p>We got some redesigns, plumped up our columnists to opinion page ratio, hired the best staff this side of the Goleta Slough, broke top news, saved the Nexus from government ineptitude with the cunning use of middle-fingering, and hey, along with the Daily Sound, we’re the only daily newspaper left in this city. Cheers!</p>\n<p>Yep, to answer your next question, I am pretty hot shit.</p>\n<p>And I owe it all to you. No, not you, the average reader, reading this. I mean the people below in the staff box, and all those who came before and all those yet to come. Thank you, Brendan Buhler, Jason La (I learned the most from you), Daniel Haier, Matt Dozier. My hat’s off to Kristen Richer. Thanks for the memories; hope y’all join me in Nexus Valhalla for a few drinks.</p>\n<p>Where would I be without my loyal staff this year? It’s rare to work with people you love, and even rarer to work with people you respect and trust to do the job well.</p>\n<p>My friends, I wish I had the words, I often do, but they say to write from your heart and since you have half of mine, this message will be a slice of what it could have been.</p>\n<p>To Devon Claire Flannery, for being my first lieutenant and second set of eyes, particularly for catching all those potentially ugly mistakes (as well as the ones that got through). You not only polished the paper, you made it sparkle. You also kept us out of a lot of trouble, while managing to raise hell. If I weren’t such a stickler, I give you a smiley emoticon right now.</p>\n<p>Police Blotter extraordinaire Nikki Moore – barrel of monkeys level of fun and Southern Comfort level of intoxicating. You steered a big ship at county desk, and brought in too many catches to count. Here’s to your passion; it made it all the while.</p>\n<p>David Ferry. Stop whatever you’re doing. No, put it down. Put Aria down. And yes, there is a Santa Claus. He’s bringing you pants without holes in them.</p>\n<p>Dana Olsen, you’ve got a big job ahead of you, one I know you’re ready for. Have fun covering county supervisors, court cases, drunken revelry and the occasional dead albino raccoon. You’ll do it with flare and maybe a “Legends of the Hidden Temple” shirt.</p>\n<p>Miss Lindsey Miller – you were a constant counselor, a wise peer and a good friend. You did a better job at university desk than I, and probably with a lot less yelling. I’m glad we grew up in the office together. The honor was all mine. (Comma splice!)</p>\n<p>Megan “I’m not 15” Snedden: I had you picked out from day one, kid. You’re going far. You deserve nothing less. When I own my own paper, I’ll let you cover Leg again, if you really want it.</p>\n<p>Aria Miran. You and Ferry need a timeout. But really, a few laughs and inappropriate jokes with you make the medicine go down. You definitely make it to my top eight MySpace friends list. Even as a fresh-faced reporter you stuck out as something more, like a fresh-faced university editor. Welcome to the desk; I wouldn’t want it left in any other hands.</p>\n<p>I’m really sorry, Sabrina Ricci, for all those times we accidentally called you “Christina Ricci” when you weren’t in news meeting. Now you know. And now I’m graduating, so you can’t get mad. You got heart and the fortunate job of “layout editor,” complete with all the sexual innuendos associated with “laying” stuff out.</p>\n<p>Aaron Wu and Matt O’Leary, y’all put up with some confused editors, last minute shots and spectacularly boring board meetings. Thank you for your endless patience. We would be spectacularly boring without you. And sans pretty pictures.</p>\n<p>To my most valuable player and fellow graduate Anna Oleson-Wheeler. What didn’t you do? AOW, with a flick of your wrist you had AP, reception and production under wraps, with a bit of nod to sports. Thanks for the memories and double thanks for the booze.</p>\n<p>To Barb Maclean, Linda Meyer and J.E. Anderson. Your devotion to us kids knows no bounds, and your guidance was irreplaceable. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope we made you proud.</p>\n<p>More with sports, we got Chris Hoffman, but my heart belongs to Monique Moyal and Jeff Gibson. Monique, we missed you. And Jeff, you need to stop stressing. You should try pot sometime.</p>\n<p>Those cool kids at Artsweek – Mollie Vandor, Sophia Kercher and my fellow Lasallian Cameron Smith – thanks for putting up with the changes, but also thanks for delivering the hipster to our pages. It’s nice not being lame through and through.</p>\n<p>Oh, Nicki Arnold. Way to hold the fort down in the opinion office, and thank you for being a great staff writer the year before. You are the bee’s knees, and have a contagious smile.</p>\n<p>Mark Batalla, my answer to your question is “Oh. Dear. God. Sigh. Fine, print it.” You were my happiest excuse never to censor, and I’m glad you trusted to ask me first. You dedicated more of your talent here than just about anyone, and it certainly didn’t go unnoticed. I’d mention each of your artists by name, but I’d rather someone write in angry about it so I could see more of their work. You all made the opinion page everyone’s first stop in the morning. It was a pleasure.</p>\n<p>Online Editor Craig Calkins, Jesus Christ you stepped it up. We’ll make it to that shining city of perfect websites one of these days. You were tenacious, talented and occasionally morally perverse, a contradiction wrapped in a certainty. I don’t even know what I just wrote, but you were awesome.</p>\n<p>But I’m eager to get on you, copy cats. Copy, you will always be loved, sometimes feared, with nothing but a comma and an adverb separating the two. Dianne Jobson, good luck in your new position. Just slow down on the caffeine pills. Kate Rushton, I’m glad to be graduating with you, though I’ll also be glad to see you at your new beginnings – you’ve got the right stuff. Valerie Tidwell, not only are you a worthy redhead, you’re also the sharpest knife in the drawer, capable of cutting anyone down to size. You were a miracle staff writer as well.</p>\n<p>Melissa Davis and Becky Gayle, you deserve a special place in my heart, and I will miss you. Melissa, McCarthy was a bad man. Becky, goddamn we missed you.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to name all of you, copy (par for the course, right?). Just know you had the hardest job and a hushed respect in the office. You made my nights a joy, and my newspaper the best I’ve seen. Thank you so much.</p>\n<p>How much happiness it brings me to end with you, Nick DŸrnhšfer. The wisest advice I received when I became editor I will now pass on to you: It doesn’t matter if you break the biggest story of the century, or take down some bad guys or win first place awards in every category. It matters that you take care of the Nexus so that one day, your successor can. You’ve learned all you can from me, and outpaced my creativity. I got a sneaking feeling you’re going to be that first-place-winning successor.</p>\n<p>Just remember that a year from now, all this will seem very funny. You have no idea what that means now.

As the man’s growing frustration got the better of him, he began to cry.</p>\n<p>Officers then arrested the man for public intoxication. While deputies transported him to jail, the man became very emotional and again started to cry.</p>\n<p>The subject confessed that his girlfriend had just broken up with him, and he had only wanted to give her a birthday card. The man admitted that he had made a mistake by drinking too much “cheap” vodka and apologized to officers for getting plastered.</p>\n<p>The man was booked at the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>A Flash of Brilliance Belligerence<br>\nFriday, Nov. 10, 5:20 a.m. – Officers walking by a bus stop on Camino del Sur observed a 21-year-old man lying on a bench.</p>\n<p>As a deputy approached the man, he saw that the subject’s pants were unzipped and his penis was exposed. The man was lying in a pool of urine, which streamed down the bench into a nearby gutter.</p>\n<p>The officer attempted to wake the leaky lawbreaker by shouting at the subject, but eventually had to administer a sternum rub to elicit a response.</p>\n<p>When the wiz kid woke up, he was extremely disoriented and repeatedly told officers that he lived on “Ryan Street.”</p>\n<p>Since that street does not exist anywhere near Isla Vista, the officer decided to arrest the filthy flasher for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed and left to mull over his own mess, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>All I Want to Do Is Bicycle!!!<br>\nSaturday, Nov. 25, 9:15 p.m. – Deputies were patrolling the 6700 block of El Colegio Road when they saw a 22-year-old man zoom past them on a bicycle.</p>\n<p>As the subject sped past the officers, he fell off the bike and flew through the air, before ultimately crashing on to the pavement. He stumbled for several yards before regaining his balance.</p>\n<p>In a rage, the man picked up his bike and threw it to the ground. He then flopped down on to the street, where he sat, pouting, until an officer approached him.</p>\n<p>The deputy detected a strong odor of alcohol and noticed that the surly cyclist’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy. When the officer began questioning the subject, the man attempted to answer -but only managed to say, “I live at 555… ah… I’m not sure.”</p>\n<p>Despite the commendable effort to remember where he lived, the man was completely oblivious to his surroundings and could not even stand up. To ensure the man’s own safety, the officer arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The subject was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

He began calling the deputies “motherfuckers” and started ranting incoherently about the movie “Super Troopers.”</p>\n<p>Taking a cue from the film, officers put the man in his place – jail – after arresting him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Sunday, Nov. 5, 1:43 a.m. – An officer patrolling the 6600 block of DP observed an 18-year-old man leaning on a vehicle in a driveway.</p>\n<p>The man was loudly announcing, “I love my parents.”</p>\n<p>The inebriated freshman – who was apparently a little more than homesick – could not maintain his balance without help, which led the deputy to conclude that the man was intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The subjects accompanying the delinquent told officers they did not know the tanked teen, and could not take him home to the Santa Rosa Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>For the man’s safety, the officer arrested him for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Friday, Oct. 27, 12:48 a.m. – Officers were alerted to a fight while standing at the intersection of DP and Camino Pescadero.</p>\n<p>The deputies found two women wrestling on the sidewalk, as a third woman attempted to break up the brouhaha.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as the two pulled the other’s hair and slap at each other before ending the scuffle.</p>\n<p>After checking the women for injuries, the deputies arrested the disorderly women for disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p>An officer began searching the subjects’ belongings, and was going through the 20-year-old woman’s purse when he found pot inside.</p>\n<p>When he showed the woman the illegal substance, the stoner bluntly said, “I wish I had some marijuana right now.”</p>\n<p>After hearing this, the officer arrested the woman for public intoxication, and dragged her into the patrol car where the subject’s smoldering temper got the best of her.</p>\n<p>As the fiending offender was transported to jail, she repeatedly kicked the plexiglass shield in the patrol car with her red, heeled shoes, causing over $200 in damage.</p>\n<p>The woman was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail, and housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-12508\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-12508\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/","id":3879,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3878,3877,3876],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/266"}},"__N_SSG":true}
