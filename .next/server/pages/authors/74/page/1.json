As one Walter Hartwell White might phrase it, Pete Carroll is in the empire business.</p>\n<p>After perhaps the most dominant Super Bowl performance in history, a feat he accomplished with one of the youngest and most salary-cap friendly teams in the league, Carroll sits at the helm of a budding dynasty.</p>\n<p>This isn’t new territory either. Carroll won back-to-back championships with the University of Southern California in 2003 and 2004, won six BCS bowl games in nine years and finished in the top four of the Associated Press Poll in seven consecutive seasons. Before the reign of the SEC in college football, Carroll’s Trojans were the dominant program in the entire nation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But the word on Carroll in previous years was that he was a college coach, and a college coach only. Before he went to Southern California, Carroll had unsuccessful tenures with the New York Jets and New England Patriots. A late season slide resulted in a 6-10 record with the Jets in 1994, leading to his firing after one season.</p>\n<p>Because of his success as a defensive backs coach and a defensive coordinator, he was given the chance to follow Bill Parcells in New England. The Patriots made the playoffs in Carroll’s first two seasons, but Carroll was again fired after a late season slide in 1999.</p>\n<p>Carroll had gained a reputation as a lame duck NFL head coach, but created a new legacy as an all-world recruiter and young spirit with his time at USC. He is the epitome of a player’s coach, and it translated to success in the NFL with this young Seahawks team. It’s not every day where a 62-year-old head coach connects with his players as equals, participating in full-contact drills one day and leading meditative yoga sessions the next.</p>\n<p>Carroll encourages his players to be themselves, on-and-off the field, which is part of the reason the attitude and sometimes overzealous confidence of the Legion of Boom is tolerated by fans in Seattle. Also, a Super Bowl ring helps.</p>\n<p>After becoming only the third coach in history to win a Super Bowl and a National Championship, Pete Carroll has established himself as one of the all-time greats, not just in college football. He is far and away the best football coach in the western United States (all due respect to Jim Harbaugh, but Pete has the hardware), and deserves to be included with names like Bill Belichick and Nick Saban in the conversation of best coach in America.</p>\n<p>There is also the strong possibility that we might be witnessing the next NFL dynasty evolving before our very eyes. Seattle has a 25-year-old franchise quarterback who has had more winning success in his first two years than any player in history, lethal weapons on offense in Marshawn Lynch and Percy Harvin, the best secondary in the last 20 years with all three of their all-world players returning, salary cap flexibility once they get rid of some overpriced inessential players and the best home-field advantage outside of Kansas City.</p>\n<p>A winning culture has been restored in Seattle, and Pete Carroll is leading the way. He was voted most popular coach in the league by players, and with his emphasis on relentless competition, no matter the situation, the loaded NFC can count on the road to the Super Bowl going through the 12th man.</p>\n<p>One would think Carroll has earned some rest and relaxation after such an epic journey. He’s having none of that though. The Seahawks victory parade is scheduled for Wednesday. Meetings to begin the 2014 season occurred yesterday. A champion’s work is never done. Always compete.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/","id":2058,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2057,2056,2055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Richard Sherman on Point, Crabtree a Sore Loser","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/richardsherman.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/richardsherman.png?resize=661%2C492&ssl=1","description":"Richard Sherman's trash talking is part of his game.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>First of all, let me begin by stating something that sometimes goes under the radar in the debate of Richard Sherman. Michael Crabtree started it. All season long, Crabtree has been talking about Sherman and about how overrated he is. He was never quite blatant about it, and most of his comments were said when few people were watching. He surely never said anything on the same stage that Sherman did. But he said it nonetheless, and it was a chip that Sherman carried on his shoulder all season long.</p>\n<p>Then after all that, Sherman still went to congratulate Crabtree on “a hell of a game”. After the final whistle, Sherman went to shake Crabtree’s hand, but his olive branch was met with a hand in the face. Crabtree might be more quiet and passive-aggressive about it, but the unsportsmanlike conduct went both ways and started with Crabtree’s “DeMarcus Cousins-esque” rejection of civility. Imagine what Crabtree would have said about Sherman if Crabtree wasn’t a loser this season.</p>\n<p>So after that, Sherman was a little fired up. He has just made the game-winning play, sending his beloved team to the Super Bowl. The adrenaline was still pumping, and Sherman’s eyes had a fierce, hungry look in them.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He had just proved all his critics wrong, yet, again, but there was still unfinished business to attend to. He wanted it to be perfectly clear to the whole world that his Seahawks were not the underdogs against anyone, including the red-hot 49ers and the mighty Denver Broncos.</p>\n<p>Sherman has had to defy the odds and make his statement through actions his entire career. Crabtree was a first-round draft pick, Sherman was a fifth-round pick. Crabtree is making top-ten-pick money, while Sherman is making the league minimum.</p>\n<p>Crabtree is being labeled as having the best-hands of all-time, a distinction that completely disrespects previous 49er legends such as Jerry Rice, while Sherman was still an unknown entity to NFL fans even this season. Yet Sherman has been to multiple Pro Bowls and leads the best defense in the NFL, while Crabtree is just a good player on an average offense.</p>\n<p>Even Crabtree’s after-the-fact retort was weak. After the game and the interview, Crabtree tweeted “Film don’t lie. Show me the tape where the guy is the best.” Well Mike, we could show you that tape of the final play of the game a thousand times, and you still won’t get the picture. The fact that there is no other tape besides that play is a testament to the extent of which your quarterback fears Sherman Island.</p>\n<p>Which begs the question: Who do you want on your team? Seattle fans and Sherman’s teammates alike adore their star cornerback. He has demonstrated loyalty, intensity and excellence ever since he came to Seattle, and his trash talking is funny and endearing to everyone who isn’t on the receiving end of it. Pete Carroll approves of Sherman’s aura and believes it inspires the rest of the Legion of Boom.</p>\n<p>Sherman backs up his trash talk on the field and is a well-spoken, respectful, interesting dude off the field. I don’t think any “thugs”, as Niner fans refer to Sherman, have graduated from Stanford with a GPA hovering around 4.0.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Sherman is the best cornerback in the game, and if his intensity and trash talking in the game are part of what makes him the best in the world, that’s just something fans must live with. The 12th man is behind Sherman every step of the way and love who he is on and off the field.</p>\n<p>While Sherman’s postgame interview might have been a little off-putting to some, it was an extreme and highly publicized moment. It was the culmination of years of adversity being overcome, expressed in the heat of the moment after a positive gesture was rejected. Crabtree needs to shut his mouth and hit the practice field if he wants to say anything about Sherman in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 29, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/","id":3250,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3249,3248,3247],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leaders for the Next Great Japanese Pitcher","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tanaka.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tanaka.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Masahiro Tanaka might be the next great Japanese pitcher to come to the MLB.

He went 24-0 with a 1.27 ERA on way to an MVP award and a Japan Series championship. The superstar from Hyogo started 30 consecutive games without recording a loss, a streak that lasted until his 160-pitch effort in game six of the Japan Series. Tanaka then bounced back to close out game seven and secure a championship for the Golden Eagles.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>From a scouting perspective, Tanaka has the makeup to match the numbers. He stands at 6’2” with a smooth, repeatable delivery that results in pinpoint control (183 strikeouts to 32 walks in 2013).</p>\n<p>Although he doesn’t have the overwhelming power fastball of the other Asian pitcher who came to America in recent memory with this much hype, 6’5” Texas Rangers pitcher Yu Darvish, Tanaka’s heater sits in the low 90’s and comes with a great horizontal slider to offset it. His out-pitch is a split-finger fastball that will instantly be among the best in baseball and bring back memories of Roger Clemens. Like Darvish, Tanaka utilizes a wide repertoire of pitch types to keep hitters off-balance, including off-speed pitches and a variety of cuts and sinking breaks on his fastball.</p>\n<p>In style and professional background, Tanaka resembles Hiroki Kuroda of the Yankees and Hisashi Iwakuma of the Mariners more than Darvish, but the level of success in Japan is more reminiscent of the latter. Given that all three pitchers are Cy Young contenders at their best, Tanaka faces high hopes and expectations. His predecessors established a blueprint for a successful Japan to U.S. transition, and while not every import is a success story (see: Daisuke Matsuzaka), Tanaka has shown the potential to be the greatest of them all.</p>\n<p>The question on everyone’s mind remains: Where will Tanaka sign? The courting process is coming to an end with teams making their pitches and final offers. According to the new international posting rules, Tanaka must sign by Friday, which means he will have to announce his decision by Wednesday in order to allow a couple days for the necessary physical examination.</p>\n<p>Five teams have been named as “finalists” for Tanaka’s services. The New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers are widely regarded as the favorites to sign him, for a variety of reasons. The Yankees are in desperate need of a new ace pitcher and are opening up the checkbook with no further regard for the luxury tax threshold. In previous years, what would have been a sure-thing signing for the Yankees is not so concrete today. They have the money and the need, but Tanaka is said to prefer the west coast. His wife is a pop star in Japan, and the bright lights of Hollywood might affect his decision. If Tanaka wants to play for a contender while also being the unquestioned staff ace, the Yankees might have the edge. If Tanaka wants to play for the best team on paper with no regard for his spot in the rotation, he might choose Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers under Stan Kasten are the new big spenders in baseball and have yet to make a big splash this offseason. Even after signing Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw to long-term contracts, money is still no object for Los Angeles, especially considering they will have the huge contracts of Josh Beckett, Chad Billingsley and Dan Haren off the books by 2015, clearing up over $40 million a year in payroll.</p>\n<p>Kasten worked for the Atlanta Braves during their 1990’s dynasty, when Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz dominated the National League East. He obviously has similar aspirations with this Dodger team, and a rotation of Kershaw, Greinke, Tanaka and Hyun-Jin Ryu would be really difficult to beat in a seven-game series.</p>\n<p>Three other teams, the Chicago Cubs, Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago White Sox, have also made offers to Tanaka. Arizona in particular plans to offer every penny they can scrounge up in an attempt to woo Tanaka. The D’Backs need to take their team to the next level to compete with the other juggernauts in the National League West, and getting a great pitcher for the next decade would be a good place to start.</p>\n<p>The Cubs are rebuilding under the guidance of Theo Epstein and would offer Tanaka the chance to slowly adjust to American baseball while comfortably being the face of the franchise when they finally start to contend in a couple years. The White Sox do not have a ton of appeal, but are making a strong push anyway. Consider Seattle and the Los Angeles Angels to be dark horses in the Tanaka sweepstakes.</p>\n<p>Whatever team wins the bidding for Tanaka, expect the deal to average around $20 million a year. Even though he has no MLB experience, $120 million over six years seems like a fair price to pay for a pitcher who is just entering his prime.</p>\n<p>Based on teams’ spending power, ability to contend, location, international marketing appeal and long-term track record, the Dodgers seem to have the slight edge on the Yankees for signing Tanaka. However, nobody will really know his priorities until a decision is made. Based on Tanaka’s Twitter post expressing his inability to reach a final decision, expect the race to come down to a photo finish at the end of the deadline.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of january 22, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/","id":3251,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3250,3249,3248],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"If It’s Broke, Should We Fix It?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Baseball-Hall-of-Fame.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Baseball-Hall-of-Fame.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The MLB Hall-of-Fame Voting System Is Seriously Flawed, and Players are Suffering For It","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The politics of the Hall of Fame voting have created a situation where obviously worthy candidates are being passed over. Baseball fans can blame this on a set of rules (or lack of rules) that makes the voting entirely subjective and seemingly random.</p>\n<p>For those readers who don’t know about the Hall of Fame voting system, here it is: The voting is open to hundreds of sports writers across the nation, most of whom are very familiar with Major League Baseball. Notice that is “MOST,” not ALL. Sports writers who know nothing about the game or its history are still included. Players need a 75 percent vote to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, and they have a 15-year window to be inducted, given that they receive at least the 5 percent needed to stay on the ballot. However, writers can only vote for 10 players on any given year, even if there are more than 10 worthy nominees.</p>\n<p>This is where I take issue with the Hall of Fame vote. Even though baseball is, by its nature, a competitive sport, there does not need to be any sort of competitive element to the Hall of Fame voting. Baseball has one winner and one loser. There is only one championship and players will take their at-bats for 30 innings or more to decide a game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, there is no limit on the number of players that can be inducted into the Hall and the standards of excellence have been established and have evolved for over 100 years. Upon retirement, players should not still be needlessly competing. Let the Hall of Fame stand to honor and immortalize the greatest players of all time, not create drama and debate based on some sports writers’ agendas.</p>\n<p>The weight that has tipped the scales toward the side of flaw is the issue of performance-enhancing drugs. Players who have been caught using steroids and other substances are still included on the ballot with their career numbers intact. They are not even approaching the numbers needed to be inducted, yet they stay on the ballot year after year, stealing votes away from clean players who might otherwise be inducted. While one could make an argument for steroid users being inducted in the Hall of Fame, one must agree that they are being evaluated differently.</p>\n<p>A player who hits 763 home runs should not be receiving 35 percent of the Hall of Fame vote. Intuitively, he should be receiving near 100 percent or 0 percent, depending on whether or not steroid users deserve induction into the Hall of Fame. Of course, everyone has a different opinion on this, which is why the voting numbers come up somewhere in between. But a debate such as this should not interfere with the voting process of clean players. Something is wrong with the system.</p>\n<p>Steroid issues aside, there are players who are obviously being excluded who need to be in, and if a change in the system is necessary, it should be implemented next year. Frank Thomas, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux were all locks and rightfully inducted in their first year of eligibility.</p>\n<p>But what about Craig Biggio? The Houston Astros legend recorded 3,000 hits in his career while playing Gold Glove defense and holding three of the most demanding positions in baseball: catcher, second base and centerfield. Those numbers, combined with his impeccable baseball character, make Biggio’s Hall credentials undoubtable, yet he fell two votes shy of induction. Common sense says he’ll make it next year, but what happens when another crop of bonafide legends (Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz, Gary Sheffield and Nomar Garciaparra) come up on the ballot? The steroid issue will surely not be resolved by next year, and the field will remain crowded.</p>\n<p>And that doesn’t even consider the other 2014 snubs. Mike Piazza of the Dodgers and Mets is the greatest offensive catcher of all-time, yet he fell 13 percent shy of induction this year. Piazza seems like a surefire Hall-of-Famer, yet he was excluded this year because certain baseball writers thought that even though he was worthy, he wasn’t “first-ballot” worthy. Politics like this have skewed the voting for far too long.</p>\n<p>Jeff Bagwell teamed up with Biggio in Houston for years and was one of the best first basemen ever, every bit the equal of his teammate. Curt Schilling of the Phillies, Diamondbacks and Red Sox has the numbers and career success, if not the popularity. Edgar Martinez of the Mariners revolutionized the designated hitter position and with Thomas’ induction this year, the anti-DH argument is now dead.</p>\n<p>Former Tigers pitcher Jack Morris has accumulated over 250 wins, nearly 2,500 strikeouts, all while keeping an ERA at 3.90. He is not a Hall of Fame lock by any means, but his candidacy is overshadowed due to the abundance of worthy nominees created by this logjam. In his last year of eligibility, his vote percentage actually fell 6 percent. If not for the issue of steroid users on the ballot, Morris likely would have been inducted years ago when he wasn’t going against such pitching locks as Maddux and Glavine.</p>\n<p>Lee Smith is one of the greatest closing pitchers of all-time and, after receiving 48 percent of the vote last year, saw his numbers fall below 30 percent this year. Granted, the “saves” statistic and the role of closers in general is controversial, but if a player was a pioneer of the role and is also one of the top five ever at their position, doesn’t that warrant a spot in the Hall?</p>\n<p>Poor Larry Walker of the Rockies and Cardinals is one of the greatest hitters of his generation, accumulating 383 home runs while maintaining a .313 career batting average and a .400 on-base percentage over his 17-year career. Oh yeah, he also garnered seven Gold Gloves and an MVP award. Considering he was never linked to performance-enhancing drugs in the era where they were rampant, at the surface he seems destined for Cooperstown. But Walker struggles to get 10 percent of the vote. Instead of having Hall of Fame goals, he is proud just to be on the ballot year after year.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t even consider worthy candidates with solid credentials like Tim Raines, Jeff Kent and Mike Mussina. These three have also fallen victim to the Hall of Fame problem, failing to get even 50 percent of the vote even though their numbers stack up with previous Hall of Fame players.</p>\n<p>The only reasonable solution is to eliminate the 10-vote limit. This would eliminate the issues of steroid-linked players on the ballot and allow players to be inducted purely based on their baseball merit. Voters who choose to include the likes of Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens can do so without excluding the likes of clean Hall-worthy players whose numbers aren’t quite as flashy.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it wouldn’t split the vote among worthy players, thereby eliminating the stalemate that has occurred in recent years. The vote would come down to, “Who is worthy of the Hall of Fame?” a must less subjective question than “Who is most worthy of the Hall of Fame?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53529\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53529\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/if-its-broke-should-we-fix-it/","id":3245,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3244,3243,3242],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Men’s Preview: Hawaii Men’s Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hawaii.gif?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hawaii.gif?resize=544%2C396&ssl=1","description":"Hawaii looks to be a legitimate contender after finishing with the best non-conference record in the Big West this season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its second season in the Big West, the Hawaii men’s basketball team sits in first place entering conference play with a record of 11-3, and is one of the front-runners to take the top seed in the Big West Tournament after placing fifth last year.</p>\n<p>Hawaii rode a five-game winning streak through the end of November and early December, following it up with a 2-1 record in the Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic.

The 6’ 8” senior from Munich, Germany transferred to Hawaii two years ago and has been their leading scorer ever since. So far in 2013-2014, Stanhardinger has averaged 17.8 points per game, good for second in the Big West behind only Alan Williams of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>In addition to his scoring prowess, he makes an impact on the defensive end with over a block and a steal every game to go with his 7.4 rebound average. Stanhardinger was First Team All-Conference last season and was also named to the preseason All-Conference team this season.</p>\n<p>Hawaii is not a one man show however, as they also bring two more scorers in the Big West’s top-12. Garrett Nevels, a 6’2” junior guard, is averaging 13.6 points per game to go with a 2.3 assist to turnover ratio, good for seventh in conference. Nevels can score in a variety of ways, but is a long-distance specialist with the second-best three point shooting percentage in the conference at 50.9 percent.</p>\n<p>After a great freshman season, 6’8” sophomore forward Isaac Fotu also returns to the Warriors. This season, he has averaged 13.5 points per game on 58.5 percent shooting, good for sixth in conference.</p>\n<p>Fotu is also seventh in the Big West in blocks, securing his status as a dominant defensive force in the paint. Last season, Fotu was named Big West Co-Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p>Brandon Spearman rounds out Hawaii’s big four. The 6’3” senior guard averaged 14.3 points per game in Hawaii’s big wins against Oregon State and Saint Mary’s, and put up 17 in a tough one-point loss to Boise State.</p>\n<p>Spearman can score from anywhere on the floor and is averaging 11.0 points per game, even after a shaky start to the season. He was named to the All-Tournament team in the Diamond Head Classic for which he also garnered Big West Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>If Hawaii can get all four of their stars rolling at any time, it will be tough for the rest of the Big West to dethrone them from the top spot in the standings.</p>\n<p>Hawaii begins Big West play tomorrow when the Warriors travel to San Luis Obispo to take on the Cal Poly Mustangs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in page 9 of January 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/","id":597,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[596,595,594],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One NBA Star on His Way Back, Another Out for the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Recovering Kobe Bryant Inks an Extension While Rose Goes Down Again After Just 11 Games","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Two huge stories broke yesterday that will dramatically alter the landscape of the NBA for at least the next two years.</p>\n<p>First, tragic news from Chicago validated Bulls fans’ worst nightmare: After missing all of the 2012-13 season with a torn ACL in his left knee, Derrick Rose’s comeback campaign was abruptly ended with news that he will miss all of 2013-14 with a torn meniscus in his right knee.</p>\n<p>Across the country, Laker fans got the first bit of good news on Kobe Bryant since he returned to practice.

A torn Achilles tendon can be a career-ender, especially for veterans like the 35-year-old Bryant.</p>\n<p>However, if there is any player that can do it, I’d bet my money on Kobe Bean Bryant. The man’s competitive drive and dedication to improvement is unmatched by any contemporary athlete not named Michael Jordan. He has played through broken fingers, tweaked wrists and ravaged knees. An injury to his foot is just the latest challenge to overcome, and Kobe has shown for years and years that he doesn’t mind taking some physical punishment.</p>\n<p>However, the basketball gods can be cruel. As an old man continues to defy the odds and return to prominence, a young man with all the talent in the world has his potential taken away with a simple buckle of his knee.</p>\n<p>Rose has the potential to be every bit as good of a player as Kobe is, if not better. Rose was better than Kobe at a younger age, and has a work ethic that compares. Unfortunately, NBA fans will have to wait another year to see if Rose is the same player he once was, and the question must be asked if we will ever get the pleasure of watching him dominate the game offensively again.</p>\n<p>If there is a silver lining for Bulls fans, it’s that the meniscus was salvaged and repaired via surgery, and Rose is expected to be able to make a full recovery. The results of the surgery show that the injury is not as severe as the torn ACL was, and Rose managed to come back from that in the best physical shape of his life. Rose never quite found his rhythm this year, but the athleticism was back.</p>\n<p>There is still hope that Rose can return next season and become the MVP-caliber player that he was before the injuries. He was a 22-year-old MVP and is only 25 today, still yet to reach his prime years. But to the average observer, playing like an MVP after two missed seasons in a row due to knee injuries is a hard scenario to imagine. If the Bulls’ locker room atmosphere is any indication, we could have just witnessed a Hall of Fame-worthy career deteriorate before our very eyes.</p>\n<p>But keep in mind, the last player to win an MVP award besides LeBron James was Derrick Rose. To doubt his return to greatness is to tempt the competitive spirit of a man who was seemingly born to be a champion. Rose has elite, athletic DNA, and his triumphant return would be a testament to his greatness and to the achievements of modern sports medicine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/one-nba-star-on-his-way-back-another-out-for-the-season/","id":3242,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3241,3240,3239],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jonathan Martin Wrong to Ditch His Teammates","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A look at the Miami Dolphins' bullying scandal.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Let me start by saying that the Miami Dolphins’ guard Richie Incognito should feel horribly guilty in his role regarding the pending-resignation of fellow offensive lineman and teammate Jonathan Martin. Evidence has come forward regarding Incognito’s harassment toward Martin, proving that the nine-year NFL veteran made vulgar, racist threats to the second-year pro. I don’t care what your line of work is; nobody deserves to put themselves in a hostile work environment where they feel their safety is in jeopardy. Racism and bigotry go beyond the boundaries of safety and are as open to condemnation as physical abuse and harassment. And of course nobody should be forced by others to attend “team meetings” at strip clubs and pay tabs that are not their own.</p>\n<p>But I propose that we put the most stock into the testimony of the teammates, and consider NFL locker room culture for what it is. Many of the most respected veterans on the Dolphins side with Incognito and want his suspension lifted. According to NFL Hall-of-Famer Cris Carter’s conversations with wide receiver Mike Wallace and center Mike Pouncey, Incognito is “loved” and “respected” by all his teammates. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill described Incognito as a “big brother” to Martin and “the best friend he had on the team.”</p>\n<p>And then one day, Martin cracked. After a lunchroom prank by Incognito, completely commonplace between teammates throughout the history of the NFL, Martin decided he no longer wanted to be the scrub and that he had enough. However, not once did he talk to Incognito or anyone else to express his frustration. He surprised his teammates, coaches and the league by quitting the team right before a big game and filing a formal complaint with the league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>By doing this, Martin committed multiple cardinal sins against his teammates, the ones who stand the most to lose from locker room dysfunction. He went to the media and exposed information regarding team chemistry without consulting any teammates. And HE QUIT AN NFL TEAM MID-SEASON, just because he got his feelings hurt. Abandoning your teammates for any reason within your control is far worse to a teammate than some expletive language and idle, empty threats. This behavior is despicable when acted out with sincerity and real malicious intent. But in the NFL, this kind of behavior between teammates is meant to build the mental toughness that is required in such a violent, crude, high-pressure and high-stakes job.</p>\n<p>An NFL field is a violent place by nature. Imagine 11 300-pound men trying their best to knock you out and injure you continuously for three hours. Then imagine every vile slur regarding you and your mother being spit at you while you try to counter this force. There is a reason that NFL rhetoric most resembles that of military personnel.</p>\n<p>I’m not proposing that Incognito had the right to do what he did. I’m proposing that Martin, as a fully-grown adult and an NFL player, should have a thick enough skin to stand up to Incognito and fight his battles himself. Martin is actually 10 pounds heavier than Incognito, so he has nothing to worry about as far as physical intimidation. Martin is also an educated man, a Stanford graduate who should be able to understand the context and disregard what would be considered bullying in any other line of work.</p>\n<p>Martin’s reaction could have been reflective of deeper-seeded issues. He has struggled on the field this year and lost his job as starting left tackle. If Martin has personal demons to battle before he is ready to play football again, he should take the time to sort those out and help himself get healthy. But he did not need to throw his best friend and teammate under the bus. Instead of being the bigger man and dealing with Incognito in a mature, adult manner, Martin left his team in shambles and now faces an uphill battle towards acceptance in any NFL locker room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 14, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus</p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of </em>The Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52923\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52923\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/jonathan-martin-wrong-to-ditch-his-teammates/","id":3240,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3239,3238,3237],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2013 MLB Season Recap: The Best of the Best","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cabrera-by-Amy-Chase.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cabrera-by-Amy-Chase.png?resize=504%2C504&ssl=1","description":"The best players in each position for the 2013 MLB Season","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The MLB season has come and gone.

A 16-9 record, 232 strikeouts in 236 innings, a 1.83 ERA, a 0.92 WHIP and a trip to the National League Championship Series (NLCS) should be more than enough good work to walk away with the NL Cy Young Award. The Phillies’ Cliff Lee and the Marlins’ Jose Fernandez had excellent seasons as well, but Kershaw is far and away the best pitcher in baseball, and looks to continue his reign for the next decade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Relief Pitcher: Craig Kimbrel, Atlanta Braves</p>\n<p>Kimbrel was unhittable as the closer for the Braves this year, posting a 3.3 Wins Above Replacement mark and a 1.21 ERA while registering 50 saves. In an age where Mariano Rivera is retired and elite relievers are considered a rare luxury, Kimbrel’s 101 mph fastball earns him the title of Franchise Closer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First Baseman: Chris Davis, Baltimore Orioles</p>\n<p>Baltimore faded down the stretch, but there was a time when it looked like the O’s were going to come away with the AL East crown. Davis’ historic home run streak was the heart and soul of Baltimore’s offense through the All-Star break, at which point he had 37 home runs. Davis finished the year with a .286/53/138/.370 line, enough for MVP consideration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Second Baseman: Dustin Pedroia, Boston Red Sox</p>\n<p>Dusty might not have the power numbers of rival second baseman Robinson Cano from the Yankees, but the leadership, clutch hitting, defense and intangibles that Pedroia brings to the Red Sox vault him into this spot. He is the most valuable player on the World Series Champions and would have won the award by default if not for David Ortiz having the greatest offensive series of all time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Shortstop: Andrelton Simmons, Atlanta Braves</p>\n<p>You might be surprised to see a player with a .248 batting average make this list. But even if Troy Tulowitzki and Hanley Ramirez had been healthy all season, I think the 24-year old rookie phenom still would have won this award. Simmons came up with some big hits this season and provides a little pop to the Braves offense, but his true value is as the best defensive player in baseball playing the most important defensive position. To put it in numbers, Simmons won 5.4 extra games for his team compared to the average player, just as a result of his defense. The next closest shortstop put up a 2.2 DWAR. To put it rhetorically, Simmons is the next Ozzie Smith.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Third Baseman: Miguel Cabrera, Detroit Tigers</p>\n<p>Stat nuts and Bay-Area folk might be disappointed to find Miggy here over A’s third baseman Josh Donaldson, who was fourth in baseball with an 8.0 WAR. But Cabrera’s deficiencies on defense are overshadowed by his impact on offense as the most dominant hitter of our generation. A .348/44/137/.442 line speaks for itself when this MVP caliber season is merely average considering the player’s recent history.</p>\n<p>Outfield: Mike Trout, Los Angeles Angels</p>\n<p>Trout got off to a slow start, but quietly bounced back to be the best player in baseball yet again (9.2 WAR). If not for the Josh Hamilton/Albert Pujols disaster, the Angels would have been in contention and trout would have taken home the MVP hardware he should have won last year. Instead, he will get snubbed for the second year in a row. Good thing the kid is only 22 years old and has another 15 years to dominate baseball.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Outfield: Andrew McCutchen, Pittsburg Pirates</p>\n<p>The Pirates never would have ended their playoff drought without the incredible performance of their superstar centerfielder. McCutchen is the epitome of a five tool player, the NL’s equivalent to Trout. As long as he’s in town, the Pirates should be able to show that they were no fluke.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Outfield: Carlos Gomez, Milwaukee Brewers</p>\n<p>Gomez enjoyed a renaissance 2013 season, which established him as the star many thought he would be years ago. Maybe it’s the water, maybe it’s the local beer, but whatever it is, Gomez needs to keep drinking it. A career sub-.250 hitter, the 27 year-old broke out not only in average (.284), but in power (24 homeruns) and defense (career high 4.6 DWAR). The 8.4 WAR he brought his team are as many as every previous season combined. The career journeyman should have a home in Miller Park for many years to come.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52826\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52826\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/2013-mlb-season-recap-the-best-of-the-best/","id":3239,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3238,3237,3236],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Projected Top Five Picks of the  NFL Draft: Jaguars Grab Teddy Bridgewater First","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Jaguars Grab Teddy Bridgewater First","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Jacksonville Jaguars — Teddy Bridgewater, QB, Louisville</p>\n<p>Jacksonville’s woes don’t figure to end at any point.

Instead, Freeman is now a benchwarmer for the Minnesota Vikings, leaving Vincent Jackson and Mike Glennon as the only notable players on a porous offense. The defense is actually alright, especially against the run. Clowney is far and away the best player in the draft, and the only way he doesn’t go to the Bucs here is via a trade. An elite pass rusher is the only missing ingredient from this defense and would be exactly what Tampa Bay needs to get back to their smash-mouth, physical style that took them to the Super Bowl over a decade ago.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings — Marcus Mariota, QB, Oregon</p>\n<p>The signing of Josh Freeman signifies the end of the Christian Ponder era in Minnesota. However, after Freeman’s cringe-worthy debut for the Purple People Eaters, it is clear that their franchise QB is not on this roster at the moment. Enter Mariota. The redshirt sophomore phenom is skyrocketing up draft boards and is now being ranked even higher than Teddy Bridgewater. Mariota’s 95.5 Total Quarterback Rating is tops in the nation and better than all of the last four Heisman-winning quarterbacks. He has elite athleticism comparable to Robert Griffin III, and this season he has added the ability to throw deep passes down the sidelines. Bridgewater is considered more of a sure thing, and thus more likely to go number one. But Mariota has the highest upside of any offensive player in the draft and has a chance to leapfrog into the number one spot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New York Giants — Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p>\n<p>Through the first six games of the season, New York was historically awful, even giving the Jaguars a run for their money as worst in the league. They seemed to have turned it around a bit, although their only two wins have come against a demoralized Vikings team and a beat-up Eagles team. Their point differential and unbalanced team composition are the makeup for a terrible team, and they need to add some great role players to contend next year. A franchise left tackle like Matthews would help protect Eli Manning, restore the capacity to utilize Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks and rejuvenate the worst running game in football. A playmaker on defense is also a possibility, but I expect NY to look to improve an offense that earlier in the season got shut out by the Carolina Panthers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Houston Texans — Sammy Watkins, WR, Clemson</p>\n<p>This would be the pick if the season ended today and no trades were made, but I don’t expect it to actually shape up this way. Houston needs a quarterback, but with Mariota and Bridgewater off the board, there is no player worthy of a top five pick. I expect Houston to trade down and go after someone like Brett Hundley, Tajh Boyd or Johnny Manziel. However, all this considered, Watkins would be a solid pick for the Texans here. An explosive playmaker on offense, Watkins has the potential of an elite number one to take the place of the slowing Andre Johnson. He does incredible things after the catch and is showing the technical ability to be a reliable, go-to threat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52660\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52660\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/","id":2086,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2085,2084,2083],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Can’t Miss Predictions Entering the NBA Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NBALogo.svg_.png?resize=197%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NBALogo.svg_.png?resize=197%2C447&ssl=1","description":"LeBron and co. are ready for a three-peat.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I must be honest.

Last season’s seventh place finish was a complete disaster, and the team has been blown up with no significant improvements in the offseason. Dwight Howard abandoned ship after failing to live up to the hype while recovering from surgery. Now the hopes of the Lakers rest in the hands of Canada’s founding father Steve Nash, a pair of seven-foot cavemen [age and facial hair considered] in Pau Gasol and Chris Kaman, and a trigger happy journeyman wing referred to as “Swaggy P.” Shooting guard Nick Young fills the void left by Kobe Bryant and figures to be the Lakers’ leading scorer as long as Kobe is rehabbing. Of course, Kobe is the toughest athlete in the nation and could surprise everyone with an early triumphant return, and Pau is aging gracefully as a still effective starter. But the stars are aligned for the team in red that plays at Staples Center this year.</p>\n<p><strong>The 76ers will “win” the “waste for Wiggins” race</strong></p>\n<p>With the balance of power in the NBA extremely top-heavy for the last decade, teams realize that being awful and throwing a season in the hopes of landing the top pick in the draft is more advisable than dwelling in mediocrity for years and years. Just ask the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors and Portland Trail Blazers, among others. The 76ers could be historically bad, with the Andrew Bynum experiment ending in failure and their best player Jrue Holiday being traded for a first round pick with a torn ACL. Nerlens Noel is out for the season, leaving Evan Turner as the only solid starter on the entire roster. Spencer Hawes has shown flashes of being a very productive player, but the team will still be awful even with those two playing their best basketball.</p>\n<p>We could see some great stories this season. The Cavaliers could return to contention, the Pacers will be better this year, and the return of Derrick Rose to the Bulls could give the Heat a run for their money. But at the top of the hierarchy, the song remains the same.

Matt Kemp is out for the season, Hanley Ramirez broke a rib after being hit by a 96 mph fastball and Andre Ethier looks as rusty as he’s ever been after missing extended time with an injury.</p>\n<p>To top things off, the Dodgers had just lost the advantage of their trump card. After losing games one and two in which Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw pitched, L.A.’s greatest strength was nullified. L.A. couldn’t get across the key run in game one, wasting valuable scoring opportunities and losing in extra innings. The Dodger bats got even colder in game two, with the team failing to score a run and losing a great Kershaw start on a sacrifice fly. Yasiel Puig was hitless through the first two games, and Ramirez never got the chance to hit in a key situation with the Cardinals constantly pitching around him.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, Carl Crawford has been enjoying a power surge, accounting for the only two runs in game one for the Dodgers. It just wasn’t enough to overcome a deep and fundamentally sound St. Louis team. Ethier missed a ball in centerfield that was enough to nullify Greinke’s excellence and send the game to extras, and the Redbird crowd was ridculously loud in extra innings. Despite seeing the potential that got Los Angeles to the NLCS in the first place, it was St. Louis that kept doing the little things necessary to win the close games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With Hyu-Jin Ryu going against St. Louis Cardinals’ ace Adam Wainwright, things were looking grim for the team that was favored to win the World Series weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear, Ryu is no slouch. The South Korean native finished the regular season with 14 wins and a 3.00 ERA — impressive numbers that warrant Rookie of the Year considerations. However, Ryu was less than stellar in his first career postseason start, allowing six hits and four runs in three innings. Whether it was nerves or another injury that plagued Ryu, he did not look like himself.</p>\n<p>After getting swept in the first phase of games in St. Louis, L.A. rebounded in a big way upon their return to Chavez Ravine. Ryu pitched like the master control specialist we all knew he could be. His changeup was on point, painting the corners of the strike zone for seven flawless innings, and the Dodgers won 3-0 on Puig, Gonzales and Ramirez’s RBIs. The Dodgers got their clutch hits when they mattered, and the defense backed up Ryu for the shutout.</p>\n<p>At press time, the Los Angeles Dodgers face a 3-1 deficit against the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series with revitalized hope. Ryu’s reemergence assures that the Dodgers will get one more shot to throw an ace on the table, with Greinke slated to go in game five. One win in two games at home will give the ball back to Kershaw for game six.</p>\n<p>After a tremendous performance that ultimately resulted in a loss, Kershaw has his eyes set on nothing short of a perfect game in his next start, should it come about. That might be aiming high for any other pitcher in baseball, but not Kershaw’s. The numbers speak for themselves. An ERA of 1.83 puts Kershaw’s name up among the ranks of Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Bob Gibson and the ‘first coming’ of Kershaw, an old Dodger named Sandy Koufax. He has allowed less than one baserunner an inning, and every start in which the Dodgers do not win when he’s on the mound is considered a failure.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers went 42-8 over a 50-game stretch that began in June when the team was in last place. It started with the return of Ramirez from injury and the 10,000-watt jumpstart known as Puig. And so was the story when L.A. won game three on Monday. The parallelism is eerily similar.</p>\n<p>Call me optimistic, but I’m expecting something special. The team can take notes and watch video of the different stretches in the season to see what they did right and what they did wrong. And manager Don Mattingly will keep the atmosphere calm, collected and focused. The Dodgers are at their best when their hitters don’t try to do too much, get on base instead of swing for the fences and trust their teammates.</p>\n<p>Ricky Nolasco couldn’t hold his own on Tuesday night against Lance Lynn, but the Dodgers will be in prime position to pull off a three game upset with Greinke going at home in game five and Kershaw in a position to potentially pull even the series back in St. Louis.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is entirely skeptical. The Dodgers are still down and need to continue to figure out ways to win. In the first two games of the series, L.A. made mistakes and did not capitalize with runners in scoring position. But St. Louis made fielding mistakes in game three that prove they aren’t perfect. Make no mistake about it; the Dodgers will go as far as their pitching takes them. The offense is hit or miss, no pun intended, with all the injuries up and down the lineup.</p>\n<p>But L.A. has been in this position before. The situation following game two is too similar to where the team saw themselves in June. They overcame injuries and missed opportunities before, and now they know exactly how to do it again. The Cardinals are known to play mistake-free baseball, so the Dodgers will have to capitalize on their superior talent by matching them play for play. After overcoming St. Louis’ ace and getting back in this series, L.A. is buzzing for baseball once more.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of October 16, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>Art by Emily Zhang of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52490\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52490\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/dodgers-trying-to-stay-alive-in-the-postseason/","id":3235,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3234,3233,3232],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 6 Gauchos Face the Top Teams in the Nation at the SoCal Tournament, Play No. 11 Concordia Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_MWaterpolo_100712-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_MWaterpolo_100712-1.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB men's water polo heads to SoCal Tournament","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo sits at 11-2 on the season, and will compete in the SoCal Tournament this weekend hosted by UC Irvine.

Santa Clara is also in the same bracket as UCSB.</p>\n<p>“You always are aware of the teams in front of you, especially when there’s a likely matchup soon,” Shoemaker said. “However, all of our focus in on game one against Concordia who could definitely play a tough game with us if we aren’t mentally prepared.”</p>\n<p>The tournament is composed of 16 teams, all nine MPSF teams and includes the top 10 teams in the nation, including No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 USC, No. 3 Pacific, No. 4 Stanford and No. 5 California.</p>\n<p>The game begins at 12:15 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52409\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/no-6-gauchos-face-the-top-teams-in-the-nation-at-the-socal-tournament-play-no-11-concordia-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52409\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/no-6-gauchos-face-the-top-teams-in-the-nation-at-the-socal-tournament-play-no-11-concordia-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/no-6-gauchos-face-the-top-teams-in-the-nation-at-the-socal-tournament-play-no-11-concordia-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/no-6-gauchos-face-the-top-teams-in-the-nation-at-the-socal-tournament-play-no-11-concordia-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/no-6-gauchos-face-the-top-teams-in-the-nation-at-the-socal-tournament-play-no-11-concordia-saturday/","id":5107,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[5106,5105,5104],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"He Said, He Said: Broncos Have a Chance to Go Undefeated","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Manning.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Manning.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Are the Denver Broncos one of the best teams ever?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The 2013 Denver Broncos have as good a chance to go undefeated as any team in recent memory. After a 51-48 comeback win against Dallas last Sunday, the team has shown that they have what it takes to win in the clutch after coasting to easy wins in weeks one through four. Granted, Tony “Choke-O” played his usual game of three brilliant quarters and an epic implosion, but it ultimately came down to an aging quarterback showing he still has a few tricks up his sleeve.</p>\n<p>At age 37, Peyton Manning continues to make jaws drop across the nation with his record-breaking passing numbers and game-to-game dominance. Two years removed from career-threatening neck surgery, Peyton is on track for about 6,000 yards and 60 touchdowns this season alone, putting him in contention for the most coveted title in sports, “Greatest Quarterback of All Time.”</p>\n<p>In the game against the Cowboys, Peyton recorded his 20th TD of the year and threw his first interception. He even ran for a touchdown on an improvised bootleg that he declined to tell his teammates and coaches about.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Broncos aren’t just about Manning though. Demaryius Thomas is playing as well as any wide receiver in football right now, and would have even gaudier numbers if not for Wes Welker and Eric Decker sharing targets. Consider first-year starter Julius Thomas emerging as the best tight end in football not named Jimmy Graham, and Denver has the best four pass-catchers that we’ve seen in recent memory … maybe ever.</p>\n<p>The three-headed mini-monster of Knowshon Moreno, Montee Ball and Ronnie Hillman are more than serviceable in a pass-heavy NFL, considering the New Orleans Saints, Green Bay Packers and New York Giants all won the Super Bowl in the last five years with less firepower out of the backfield. They each provide something unique and valuable to the team, with Moreno being the workhorse and pass-blocker, Ball being the goal-line threat and power back and Hillman providing quickness and an explosive playmaking element. Moreno in particular is having the career-year everyone has been waiting for, averaging over five yards per carry with defenses sagging off to protect against the dangerous pass attack.</p>\n<p>Granted, the defense gives up a ton of passing yards, but this is only because opponents are usually down by multiple touchdowns in the first quarter and throw like mad in an attempt to play catch-up. When it comes down to it, cornerbacks Champ Bailey and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie are talented enough to make big plays in the outside, and the return of linebacker Von Miller gives Denver a much-needed playmaking pass-rusher.</p>\n<p>Statistically, Denver is first in the NFL in yards allowed against the run, although, on paper, their interior defensive line and linebackers might be considered a weakness. Their dynamic passing offense covers up this chink in the armor, as the numbers show.</p>\n<p>The last team to make an honest attempt at going undefeated was the 2009 Indianapolis Colts. They won the first 14 games of the regular season and might have gone undefeated if not for resting their starters in the final two games. The quarterback of that historic team: Peyton Manning. Now, in the last few years of his career, maybe Peyton will decide to go out, play 16 weeks of world-class football and make a run at history.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52376\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52376\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-broncos-have-a-chance-to-go-undefeated/","id":3228,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3227,3226,3225],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Look at the MLB Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-forcivilminds.org_.jpg?resize=259%2C194&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-forcivilminds.org_.jpg?resize=259%2C194&ssl=1","description":"MLB column","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The MLB regular season is a grueling six-month struggle to stay healthy, fight through injuries and constantly convince yourself that every game matters, even though an August matchup with San Diego may seem trivial and pointless in the long, hot dog days of summer. Through these trials, favorites emerge and division dynasties are formed. Teams like the Yankees, Braves, Cardinals, Phillies and Rangers are used to looking forward to October as the time when their games really matter.</p>\n<p>However, when that time comes, anything can happen. One injury, one hot streak, one fluky month can change the entire complexion of the MLB postseason. Nine different teams have won the World Series in the last 12 years.  Ten different teams have lost the World Series in that time. The Dodgers, A’s and Indians are in a position to inflate those numbers. And this year, the Pittsburg Pirates are in the playoffs for the first time in my lifetime. The best part: They’re legit.</p>\n<p>In a wild baseball year when there are three single-game elimination rounds before the Division Series even begin, the 2013 World Series title is as open as ever. However, there is a formula for success that can be traced back over the last decade. Pitching wins championships, and this year, a few teams are loaded.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>According to the numbers, the Dodgers have two of the top five pitchers in baseball. In addition to Co-Aces Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke, L.A. sports two solid number threes in Hyun-jin Ryu and Ricky Nolasco. But the Dodgers are dealing with injuries to star outfielders Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier, causing them to sputter down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Whether L.A. faltered due to injuries, resting their starters or losing their momentum, they better hope their pitchers rebound to the elite level that they were at during the Dodgers’ historic hot streak. If not, St. Louis, Atlanta and Pittsburg are waiting in the wings.</p>\n<p>The Pirates can match the Dodgers’ pitching on any given day, even if they don’t have the payroll and the star power. AJ Burnett is looking like a revelation after being an injured shell of his former self in recent years. Francisco Liriano had the Cy Young season that people have been predicting since he was co-lead of a Minnesota Twins rotation with Johan Santana.</p>\n<p>While they haven’t had the headlines this season, the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves continue their persistent excellence by way of the “next-man-up” philosophy. Longtime Atlanta number one Tim Hudson went down with an injury, but next up is Kris Medlen who takes over the ace mantle after a September in which he went 4-0 with a 1.00 ERA. In year 2 PA [post-Albert], the Cardinals feature two first basemen with .300 averages in Allen Craig and Matt Adams.</p>\n<p>The National League is stacked, but on the American League side of things, the Red Sox, A’s and Rays are playing to prove that they’re for real, again. All three teams have enjoyed sustained success, but the lack of star power causes critics to doubt their legitimacy.</p>\n<p>The Red Sox, who scored more runs than anyone in the game, just won the toughest division in baseball on way to the best record of all 30 teams. Yet they’re not even considered the favorites in the American League, a distinction that belongs to the Tigers, led by Miguel Cabrera. I guess people can’t believe that the Red Sox are for real after trading Adrian Gonzalez and blowing up their team last year. But with Mike Napoli filling the void admirably, David Ortiz having a career year, and the rest of the lineup getting on base and hitting with runners in scoring position, the Red Sox could surprise everyone. Well, everyone who didn’t pay attention to the numbers.</p>\n<p>And for the second year in a row, Oakland surprised everyone and took the AL West. The legend of Josh Donaldson continues in the bay to ease the pain of the Giants fall from grace, and it seems like they have about a dozen quality pitchers waiting in the wings. If Oakland can turn Bartolo Colon into an ace at age 75 and Coco Crisp into a power hitter, I’m sold that the A’s have something supernatural going on.</p>\n<p>But the question remains: can these teams compete with the Tigers? Max Scherzer should win the Cy Young, Miguel Cabrera should be awarded “Best Hitter Of A Generation” distinctions, and Justin Verlander can still throw 101 MPH in the 9th inning of a game in October.</p>\n<p>Underdogs can heat up at any given moment as well. Just ask the Giants. San Francisco will testify that in can happen two out of three years in fact. It all comes down to health, nerves and preparation. A star-studded team like the Dodgers can choke after a cold streak down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Or they could blanket the Cardinals with dominant starting pitching that allows the bullpen to rest until the NLCS. Miguel Cabrera could hit .700 with half a dozen home runs in three games to bomb the Tigers over the A’s. Hell, he could hit like that but the rest of the lineup could freeze in the face of no-name Oakland pitchers who find their groove and hit their spots. And Josh Donaldson might hit .800 and will his team to victory.</p>\n<p>Ok that last one might be a bit of a stretch, but with the parity in baseball this year, we should be in for a postseason for the ages.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of forcivilminds.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52306\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52306\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/a-look-at-the-mlb-postseason/","id":3224,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3223,3222,3221],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 6 Gauchos go 4-0, Sweep Opposition","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_WPolo_Gauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_WPolo_Gauthier.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo team traveled south to play four games over the weekend, capturing four impressive victories in the process and improving the Gauchos’ record to 11-2 on the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo team traveled south to play four games over the weekend, capturing four impressive victories in the process and improving the Gauchos’ record to 11-2 on the season.</p>\n<p>This is following a sixth-place finish in the Nor Cal Tournament last weekend, where UCSB went 2-2.</p>\n<p>In the first game against Cal Lutheran, UCSB got off to a fast start.

As a team, UCSB locked it down, limiting Cal Lutheran to 15 shots and no goals in the game. In the end, Santa Barbara came away with a dominant 17-0 victory.</p>\n<p>After the Cal Lutheran matchup, UCSB traveled from Thousand Oaks to El Toro High School in Orange County to take on No. 11 Concordia. Things got a little dicey towards the end, but UCSB was able to come away with a close 12-7 victory.</p>\n<p>“They put the pressure on us, but we adjusted and scored three straight to end the game,” junior Derek Shoemaker said. “It wasn’t our best game of the year, but we pulled off a win against a strong team.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s doubleheader victory gave the Gauchos some momentum as they headed into the conclusion of the weekend’s contests. Saturday featured two more matches in San Diego before UCSB headed home.</p>\n<p>UCSD was first up on Saturday, and the Gauchos wasted no time getting ahead. In the first two minutes, UCSB scored two goals from Shoemaker and sophomore Nicholas Jordan.</p>\n<p>It was a high-scoring first quarter, with the Gauchos maintaining their edge at 5-4. Whitelegge again stepped up on the defensive end, leading UCSB with 10 saves and willing the Gauchos to an 11-7 victory.</p>\n<p>The victory over UCSD was the second of the season for the Gauchos, previously defeating the Tritons 16-7 back on Sept. 21 in the first game of the Nor Cal Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We traveled to San Diego and played UCSD in their home pool and put together another solid game,” Shoemaker said. “Chris played a very good game in the cage and we had many guys step up on offense.”</p>\n<p>In the final game of the weekend, UCSB stayed in San Diego to play Navy. The match was close early, with the two teams battling to a 3-3 tie at the end of the first quarter. The Gauchos created some separation in the second quarter thanks to their keeper, who shut down the Tritons to give UCSB a 6-3 advantage.</p>\n<p>The offense took off in the second half, putting up seven goals in the third quarter. UCSB maintained control for the rest of the game, finishing with a 16-7 win. Senior Matt Gronow led the way with four goals for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Navy was the first team Santa Barbara has faced this season that hails from outside California.</p>\n<p>After finishing the week 4-0, the season continues for UCSB on Oct. 12 with the SoCal Tournament in Irvine, California.</p>\n<p>UCSB will next host an Alumni Game on Saturday, Oct. 5 at 1 p.m. in Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52229\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52229\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/no-6-gauchos-go-4-0-sweep-opposition/","id":5105,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[5104,5103,5102],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/74"}},"__N_SSG":true}
