Developments over the last several months seem to have vindicated the campus free speech cause. I’m somewhat bothered by the prospect of banning chalk political statements or the constant interruption and shouting down of conservative speakers across this country.</p>\n<p>When Black Lives Matter protestors stormed the stage at DePaul University to prevent Breitbart commentator Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking, it seemed as if the claims about left-wing college students were proven true: They don’t want to hear any opinions other than their own and will actively try to stop them from even being voiced. Suffice to say that as a politically incorrect, libertarian-leaning, diehard free speech proponent, I was ready to hear what speaker Milo Yiannopoulos had to say, even if I disagreed with some of it.</p>\n<p>I walked out of the event with a profound contempt for the Young Americans for Liberty and for anyone who believes what Milo Yiannopoulos has to say is valuable. Over the course of the evening, Yiannopoulos called the UCSB gender studies professors along with all gender studies professors carpet munchers and dykes. He repeatedly returned to the right-wing mainstays that all feminists are fat and ugly. He referred to the anger of black female protestors at DePaul, saying “maybe it’s ’cause I fucked all their brothers.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>Personally, I’m the type of person inclined to make light fun of gender studies, but saying “they’re all fucking dykes” about professors at our university is a fairly revolting statement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Milo Yiannopoulos is gay, you see, and he loves to remind everyone that he likes to fuck black guys. I couldn’t help but think that it had to be uncomfortable for the small handful of black people I saw in the audience to hear the largely white group laugh at all the black dick jokes in a generally mean-spirited way.</p>\n<p>Personally, I’m the type of person inclined to make light fun of gender studies, but saying “they’re all fucking dykes” about professors at our university is a fairly revolting statement. When Milo Yiannopoulos “jokes” and his audience laughs, it’s clearly an attempt to hurt people (when they do laugh, even this crowd treats some of his forced quips with awkward silences). I’d like to ask the attendees if they wouldn’t be at least a little ashamed if they were to come face-to-face with the feminist studies professors at this school. Yiannopoulos certainly isn’t. When a feminist studies lecturer questions him, he tells her she’s been “gobbling” too much and that lesbianism isn’t real.</p>\n<p>Along with his torrent of bile, Milo Yiannopoulos did articulate a few salient points which might have otherwise been persuasive. The idea that sexual assault statistics have been fraudulently or deceptively presented, or that the gender wage gap is founded off of deceptively presented research, have merit. But the content of Yiannopoulos’s arguments isn’t remotely the point of his speech.</p>\n<p>The arguments he present become so obscured by how fundamentally caustic he is, you come to realize the point is to provoke people. Yiannopoulos injected his speech with claims like “nobody wants to fuck Amy Schumer,” which should tell you how interested he is in persuading anyone. Up until now, he has been fueled by the rowdy protests attempting to shut him down, making him look like an unfairly persecuted dissenter.</p>\n<p>Yiannopoulos praised the UCSB audience for its civility, but you could tell he was a little put out by not having a disruption. And when he gets the chance to speak uninterrupted, he’s so vile I think even his supporters catch on a little. Joking that “if American campuses really were such hotbeds of rape, I’d spend even more time on them,” he elicited groans from the audience.</p>\n<p>During the question-and-answer section, I spoke with Yiannopoulos. He and his supporters always reply to interruptions by saying that you can have a chance to speak with a question. This is part of the Young Americans for Liberty narrative about just wanting to start a discussion.</p>\n<p>What they don’t say but what should have been made evident is that this portion is the opportunity for him to belittle anyone who disagrees with them. One individual, speaking politely, questioned if the constant insults undermine Yiannopoulos’s message. Audience members responded by heckling him, shouting out “triggered” (the reference to “trigger warnings” is a favorite pejorative of this crowd).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yiannopoulos loves to peddle the stereotype of feminists as fat, ugly dykes. I wanted to see what would happen if confronted with the stereotype of his supporters: that they’re schlubby guys who can’t get laid.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My own question referred to the fact that Yiannopoulos likes to mock people based on their appearance, but meanwhile a frequent derision of his supporters is that they’re a bunch of virgins. There’s a large contingent of Yiannopoulos’s opponents who contend that his supporters hate women because they’re insecure about their sexuality. If you look at the “Feminism is Cancer” Facebook page you’ll see a barrage of insults alleging the sexual inexperience of the attendees.</p>\n<p>Yiannopoulos loves to peddle the stereotype of feminists as fat, ugly dykes. I wanted to see what would happen if confronted with the stereotype of his supporters: that they’re schlubby guys who can’t get laid. I think it bears mentioning at this point that I had to shout the second half of my question, as audience members had begun to drown me out with boos and shouts. By then, I wasn’t surprised that many of the people in the audience didn’t really believe that you shouldn’t shout people down or interrupt them. They only believed it for people who agreed with them.</p>\n<p>Yiannopoulos’s response was telling, though. He started off by saying that feminists actually are fat, but his supporters aren’t the losers they’re made out to be. He claimed this mockery was “evidence-based.”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes young men can’t, and as a Christian, I believe it’s important for the strong to protect the weak, and in many cases the young men you’re describing do have problems. They sometimes aren’t the most socially fluent. They sometimes aren’t the most sexually fluent. Fuck you for putting those people down,” he said.</p>\n<p>What Yiannopoulos appeared to be insinuating is that it’s petty and cruel to mock people based off of superficial characteristics. He even called the premise of my question an “ugly, nasty, cruel generalization.” He’s probably right, but when someone who fairly breezily labels his opponents as cunts and dykes at an event that itself should be called “ugly, nasty, cruel generalizations,” takes the moral high ground with you and sanctimoniously shames you for mirroring their invective, it makes you reel with the sheer cognitive dissonance.</p>\n<p>When someone like Yiannopoulos — who places at least as much emphasis on making fun of overweight girls as he does his actual points — says that he believes the strong should protect the weak, you really don’t know whether to laugh or cry or vomit.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yiannopoulos is a cancer on the discourse. Contrary to the organization’s claim, he doesn’t generate productive reactions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Under what justification did the Young Americans for Liberty bring these dick jokes and lesbian slurs to our campus? The president of the UCSB YAL chapter, Dominick DiCesare, convened the talk with a spurious disclaimer.</p>\n<p>“Students deserve the opportunity to discuss issues on this campus without fear of being silenced or shouted down. It is for this reason we bring a provocative man like Milo Yiannopoulos to this campus. It is important to note that YAL does not endorse what Milo says necessarily […] what we do endorse is his right to speak freely on all issues.”</p>\n<p>That sounds reasonable enough. Too bad it’s not true. Not hosting certain speakers, canceling certain speakers, even interrupting speakers may very well be juvenile, but they’re not censorship issues. Hundreds of millions of Americans are not and will never be invited to speak on a college campus. Their free speech isn’t being violated. The first amendment does not guarantee you an unlimited forum for your views at all times at all places. YAL knows this, as during the question-and-answer section they restricted the ability of individuals to expand and reply.</p>\n<p>That policy is their right; the talk is their event, just like colleges have the right to deny speakers or cancel speakers due to student protest. The first amendment does not oblige other people to give you a microphone and auditorium.</p>\n<p>YAL’s other claim, that having someone like Yiannopoulos makes for healthy discourse, is equally disingenuous. Yiannopoulos is a cancer on the discourse. Contrary to the organization’s claim, he doesn’t generate productive reactions. He transforms the discourse into a game of goading, insults and pettiness. When your speaker calls the people who disagree with you fat, ugly dykes, how can you be surprised when they call you losers that can’t get laid?</p>\n<p>YAL isn’t serious about opening up a forum for discussion, though. If they were then they’d have condemned Yiannopoulos. “Feminism is Cancer” made clear that they’re interested in the exact same insular and self-confirming echo chamber that they claim their opponents are.</p>\n<p>Inviting conservative and libertarian and anyone with a rarer point of view to speak on our campus is a noble objective. So is debating and disputing the statistics about sexual assault and the gender wage gap. But what I’ll say to the Young Americans for Liberty is that you really don’t want what Yiannopoulos espoused: for life to be more like an internet comments section.</p>\n<p>Because people could criticize how your event was a total sausage-fest. They could mock you about the creepy, middle-age guys who showed up. They could use the fact that there is possibly a higher proportion of guys in YAL who are shy or awkward around girls as a weapon against you, just like you used the fact that there might be a higher proportion of girls who are heavier or have dyed hair in left-wing circles against your opponents.</p>\n<p>When the spirit of your event appears to be such emotionally motivated petty insults, concluding that the motive is an underlying insecurity seems compelling. You can repeat that you’re trying to start a discussion as much as you want, but no one will believe you when you spend all your time instigating a shouting match.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Architecture Museum on campus before Sunday the 29, you will find an array of paintings, sculptures and multi-media fixtures that fall decidedly in the category of abstract. Beginning on May 14, six art MFA graduate students at UCSB — Emily Baker, Vanesa Gingold, Morgan McAllister, Tom Pazderka, George Sanders and Shannon Willis — debuted their theses in an exhibition at the AD&amp;A museum, which held a reception on Friday May 20. You can go and see the exhibits Wednesday through Sunday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. (8 p.m. on Thursday). If you’re worried about “not getting” any of it don’t worry, there’s a lot of variety and plenty of the art is just plain cool to look at.</p>\n<p>The installations each entail several separate pieces, usually around five to seven per artist. They run the gamut with regard to subject and medium. Pazderka focuses chiefly on wood sculptures, found objects and charcoal drawings on tar paper. Pazerka’s exhibit revolves around famous (and infamous) individuals who spent time living in cabins in isolation. His subjects, each given a charcoal portrait in his piece “Freedom Club” range from the violent to the visionary. In “The Freedom Club Cabinet of Ted and Henry,” terrorist Ted Kaczynski (aka the Unabomber) shares a wooden fixture with transcendentalist author Henry David Thoreau. The piece, and the whole installation, suggests that madness and genius are linked. When asked about the message of his piece, Pazderka explained that he shied away from messages.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71235\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1467350012\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71474\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71235\" data-attachment-id=\"71235\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/mfa-exhibition-5-20-by-christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MFA Exhibition 5-20\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-71235\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71235\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“As far as a message goes, to me it seems like this distillation of an idea that is way more complex” Pazderka said. “That’s in a way how propaganda works — you take something that is way more complex, and you just keep distilling and keep distilling and then there’s this basic idea which then turns into ideology.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Books like <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism </em>and <em>Radovan Karadžić: The Architect of the Bosnian Genocide </em>litter the wooden frames and cabinets of the fabricated cabin fragments Pazderka uses. And the artist’s aversion to propaganda becomes ironic considering one of the Freedom Club members is Leni Riefensctahl, the infamous Nazi propagandist director (even more so given that her most noted work is <em>Triumph of the Will</em>, regarded as a masterpiece of both propaganda and art).</p>\n<p>Sanders’ exhibit features mainly sculptures, composed mostly of a few skeletal, architectural frames. There’s a clear emphasis on the line quality of the structures and the workmanship behind the materials. The constructions are made mostly of wood and rope, and demonstrate a contrast between the utility of these materials and the pure, non-functional aestheticism of the final art pieces. Sanders comes from a painting background, and several paintings accompany the sculptures. These images also depict the geometric gridlines that comprise the bulk of Sanders’ exhibit.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum from this extensive sculpture-work is McAllister. McAllister has several paintings on the back wall of the gallery in addition to a few wall-mounted, three-dimensional pieces. The paintings encompass large swaths of wall space; dubbed “Eleutheromania,” they are fairly conventional abstract images, boasting mainly hues and splotches of white, pink and red.</p>\n<p>Sharing the largest and most open museum space with McAllister and Sanders is Gingold. Gingold’s exhibit includes again mostly sculpture-work. Her surrealist-inspired pieces draw heavily on both the human body and insectoid structures. The acrylic, pigment and wood of the pieces “Private Viewing” and “Egg Case” all resemble bone and skin, or even possibly exoskeleton. A large centerpiece evokes a cocoon. Much of the material for this installation is abaca paper; the process of readying the abaca paper involves wetting it, beating it repeatedly and allowing it to dry and crack. The more severe the beating, the stronger and more translucent the material becomes. While Gingold’s pieces are abstract, they remain accessible. In some sense they’re delightful — all in shades of light pink and resembling mobiles you might put above a crib — in another way they manifest body horror straight out of David Cronenberg’s films, even evocative of Lovecraftian images.</p>\n<p>Diverging from the fixed pieces of her peers, Willis’ installation contains mainly video feed, played on either flat-screen TV’s or projected onto the wall. The bulk of her exhibit takes place in a dark room in a piece called “Falling in Love While Drowning.” The installation focuses more on mood than it does physical aesthetics. The video screens project images of a distressed Willis along with a young girl playing. The feeds imply some sort of tragedy, and largely suggest symbolism of time and progression.</p>\n<p>The final exhibit (although likely the first in sight upon entering the museum) entails both a sculptural and a performative element. Baker’s work is a tribute to movement and the human form. The centerpiece of the exhibit are the paint streaks on the wall that she left when she climbed up a gym rope covered in paint. The prints that her body left appear like large-lettered calligraphy in dark pigment in “The Ascent.” Surrounding the gym rope in the middle of the room are hip and knee replacements that Baker cast in bronze herself. Also prominent in the room is “Spinal Shift” a large, warped, yellow lattice-work made of latex, steel and bronze. Baker spoke to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> about the nature of risk in the performance (both physical and ego-wise).</p>\n<p>“As a competitive gymnast you’re constantly showing and trying to be better, and to be better you have to be vulnerable, you have to allow criticism, which you have to do in art as well” Baker said. “There’s a lot of similarities in the gym that there is in the metal shop. You feel confident but you also might seriously injure yourself.”</p>\n<p>She continues to perform (although, sadly, not the painted rope-climb) by hoisting herself upside-down on the pull-up bar in an impressive feat of athleticism in the piece “Quiet Practice.” She goes every day of the installation at 3:30 [[p.m.?]] If you go, she’ll converse with you — there’s no artificial “performance” style of non-interaction.</p>\n<p>The overall verdict of the six theses is that while not every piece of every exhibit is amazing, many of them certainly are. Using many different forms and methods to cohere into unifying themes and symbols and images also creates a unique and immersive art-viewing experience. If you’re by the University Center, or on campus at all for the last few days of the exhibition, you would be wise to experience some amazing artistic talent and drop by the museum.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Quantic’s unique blend of traditionally acoustic music styles (cumbia, salsa, jazz) with edgy, electronic experimentation creates the perfect ambience for cruising through L.A. at 2 a.m. Fortunately, it also makes for a rockin’ party. On Friday, April 1 the England-born, Columbia-taught, New York-based artist came to Santa Barbara to play at Velvet Jones.</p>\n<p>Opening first was Givers and Takers, a self-described “bliss-rock” band comprised of former Gauchos. Standing at the front of the stage, lead vocalist and keyboardist Zack Greenwald wore loose, colorful clothing and a blue-and-yellow scarf around his head. He looked as if someone had tie-dyed a Hare Krishna. Givers and Takers played a relatively smooth electronic set. Most of the time, the bliss-rock label was fitting, but the band often digressed into harder chords and vocals more representative of true rock than anything particularly indie or pop.</p>\n<p>Following Givers and Takers was Xenia Rubinos. Rubinos shares some of Quantic’s Caribbean influences, but blends these with soul, hip-hop and R&amp;B. She herself boasts a smoky, soulful voice that’s simultaneously playful, oddly reminiscent of Kate Nash. She also used the full extent of her physicality on stage. Rubinos extended her arms out, twining her fingers together. She beckoned the audience closer and gracefully twirled her arms. With her unique vocals and movement, the singer crafts a distinct and affecting stage presence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Finally, Quantic himself mounted the stage with his band. They all sported shirts with green and pink triangle patterns, the kind of design that would be at home on a dashiki. Quantic (aka Will Holland) maintained an unassuming stage presence. He never stood front and center, keeping slightly back and to the right, level with his drummer and saxophonist.</p>\n<p>All three members of the band pivoted between instruments. Quantic himself played guitar and accordion; percussionist Wilson Viveros played a drum set but also hopped out front at times to rapidly beat on a single drum; regular Quantic collaborator Sylvester Onyejiaka alternated between his sax, a keyboard and a flute that he piped notes out on. Together the band fuses Latin and Caribbean vibes with electronic twists. At some point Quantic pulled out his accordion and dove into cumbia, the dance-oriented, tropical-sounding genre popular in Latin America. Holding his accordion, Quantic bounced up and down on stage, smiling widely. Later, the band played a more melodic, melancholic song Quantic called “Time is the Enemy.” The lighting designer wisely chose to bathe the stage in dark blue light. Rather than lose the audience with this more somber tune, Quantic managed to captivate them. After quite a few minutes of this, the band reverted back to a lighter, more danceable tune.</p>\n<p>One fourth-year UCSB student, Tomek Buras, spoke with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> about what drew him to Quantic.</p>\n<p>“I love the blend between the Latin and the Caribbean vibes, and I love the electronic fusion,” said Buras.</p>\n<p>Quantic is known for his preference for sharing the stage, and Friday night was no exception. L.A.-based collaborator Jimetta Rose repeatedly returned to the stage to invigorate the show. Rose exuded a formidable and exuberant presence, calling to the audience and fiercely belting out spirited lyrics. Rose embodies soul — she howls her words. At one point she implored the audience, “Tell the person next to you ‘you’re beautiful.’ We all need to hear those words, every single day.” A guy next to me said “you’re beautiful” and held out his fist to bump. I repeated the words and bumped him, not sure if what happened was a sincere exchange of genuine human affection or just a laugh. Maybe the performers do have a mystical sway in instilling a sense of free love and community into the audience through groovy Latin vibes. Certainly one elderly hippie lady (55 plus years old) seemed to believe so as she mounted the stage and swayed about, clearly drugged-out. Velvet Jones security did not share this communal euphoria. Drummer Wilson Viveros thought it was hilarious.</p>\n<p>Viveros as a musician is remarkable. The older Columbian man maintained a perpetually bemused look on his face as he plunged into several drum solos throughout the show, all done with lightning speed and precision.</p>\n<p>Near the end of his performance, Quantic played music from his most forthcoming album. The beats emanating from the speaker exhibited a harsher techno, but remained highly danceable.</p>\n<p>As his performance concluded, the audience began a chant of “Uno mas!” After a moment, Quantic came back up and spoke. “I’m afraid I’m done, due to Santa Barbara zoning laws — they’re searching people for drugs.” A moment passed. “April Fools” he said, smiling, 45 minutes into April 2 before coming back up with his band to play several mas.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/","id":6775,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6774,6773,6772],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Zion I Brings the Beat to Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-17-zion-e1455776307158.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-17-zion-e1455776307158.jpg?resize=400%2C400&ssl=1","description":"An MC spits lightning-fast rhymes from onstage.

A few hippie-looking girls stand in the middle of the club, twirling around. One scraggily bearded and tie-dye adorned individual dances, spinning bolos with rainbow neon lights attached to the end. Throughout the night, Friday-night regulars — young people dressed for the club — would trickle in. But for now, the floor belongs to counterculture vagrant-ish looking people. The stage belongs to Brayell, the Southern Californian rapper opening the show.</p>\n<p>Clearly grounded in a tradition of west coast freestyle, he rattles off rhymes with the speed that makes you wonder if he needed to do diction exercises before stepping out on stage. Aside from his rapping, Brayell (born Brandon Kelly) boasts a variety of talents. He frontlines his own band. He produces many of his own beats and plays various instruments when he records those beats.</p>\n<p>After Brayell finishes, rapper James Kaye takes the stage. Kaye bounces around the stage frenetically. His physicality informs his show. The artist likes to jump around. At one point, Kaye leaps off the stage to mosh with audience members. In a night largely dominated by freestyling, this performance distinguishes itself with its underlying electronic-pop beats. The style culminates in the riotously fun, self-hype anthem “How Come,” the chorus of which goes “If I didn’t make it, how come everybody know my name?”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brayell’s and Kaye’s music is available on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>Finally Zion I mounts the stage. Rather than announcing themselves with the usual fanfare, MC Zumbi and rapping partner Deuce Eclipse simply stand up and begin their set. The duo’s song transitions are seamless, forgoing pauses to constantly inform the audience where they are. It almost feels like Zumbi and Eclipse go for an hour without pause. This feat is especially impressive considering MC Zumbi’s age. Zion I was formed in the mid-’90s and has been a significant force in the underground and alternative rap worlds since the early 2000s. Zumbi doesn’t have the same love of milking stage time that younger performers often have, but, to his credit, he never flags and pushes himself through a solid, hour-long set.</p>\n<p>MC Zumbi (or Baba Zumbi) spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> about the show and his upcoming projects. He spoke about the medley of musical styles that go into his beats.</p>\n<p>“Always like a fusion with the beats I like, it’s got a soulful vibe, melodic, but also has that pounding bass, too. We do it all, man. I mean, I’m a child of the culture,” Zumbi said.</p>\n<p>He also commented on what led to Zion I’s eclectic mix of music.</p>\n<p>“I was born in Philadelphia, I lived in Texas, I moved to the west coast, I went to school in Atlanta … I’ve experienced hip-hop in all these different places,” Zumbi said.</p>\n<p>The different influences are audible in the performance. Zumbi favors call-and-response audience interactions. He offers up a song, “Save a Soul,” from his upcoming album. The beat is electronic and bears the hallmarks of trip-hop sounds.</p>\n<p>Zion I also embodies comradery on stage. Besides their call-and-response and prompting of the audience to sing along, they also start a “peace, love and harmony” chant. They bring the openers, both Kaye and Brayell, back on stage to freestyle and jam with them. The performers clearly pride themselves on creating genuine connections to the audience. Rapper Deuce Eclipse also had a word with the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“I pride myself on that west coast freestyle, just off the dome, kinda in the moment. The more I feel the crowd, the more I’m able to express myself,” Eclipse said.</p>\n<p>Freestyling for these performers clearly involves sensing the rhythms of the audience.</p>\n<p>“The crowd out here is so hyped, and they just give you that energy so you just work with it, kinda close your eyes and just let yourself free” Eclipse elaborated.</p>\n<p>When Zion I finally gets to their hit single, “Coastin,” the audience cheers and sings along.

The house is packed. They have come to hear two of the most celebrated classical musicians in the world.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, Jan. 21st, the famous Grammy-winning performers Itzhak Perlman and Emanuel Ax arrived at the Granada Theater in downtown Santa Barbara. The pair came to the State Street institution as part of UCSB’s Arts &amp; Lectures series. Perlman, a famous violinist, feels like a relic of a more civilized era. The musician often plays for state dignitaries; the closest he’s come to “pop culture” is his work on the acclaimed theme for “Schindler’s List.” Ax, a famous pianist and longtime partner of Yo-Yo Ma (who will be coming to the Granada through Arts &amp; Lectures this March) carries a similar pedigree with him onstage.</p>\n<p>After they were announced, the performers entered the stage. Ax walks, Perlman zooms. Perlman suffers from Polio, a disease he contracted as a young child. He whizzes onstage on the type of scooter one would see on a late night infomercial.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Mozart’s Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 17 in C Major begins, without a word from the musicians. Ax appears physically restrained, though he is partially obscured by the seated Perlman. Perlman erupts into the furious focus of a violinist sawing at maximum velocity. The two are old friends and play off of each other expertly. One patron, Anita Baldwin, spoke with the <em>Nexus</em>. “They must know each other very well. They’re, like, breathing the same breath.”</p>\n<p>The sonata’s pacing varies; the second movement creates a gentler melody and the third ramps up the speed, becoming almost frenetic by the end. The crux of the performance is the musicians’ dependence on one another. The hosts inform the audience in the beginning that while most piano-violin sonatas could be played without the violin and not lose much, Mozart’s No. 17 in C Major relies heavily on the presence of both instruments.</p>\n<p>After Mozart the pair moves into Fauré’s Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 1 in A Major. The first movement begins with a more mournful tone, and throughout the song Ax’s piano often slows to a deliberate rhythm. The third movement diverges into a more whimsical tone. After Fauré comes an intermission.</p>\n<p>Another attendee, Walter Own, gave a word to the <em>Nexus</em>. “It’s amazing, the tradition and the culture that goes into this … presence,” he said. “They played that 200 years ago. They’re still playing it — there’s a reason, [because] they don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>The lights dim, signaling the end of the intermission. The last sonata the duo played is Strauss’s Sonata for Violin and Piano in E-flat Major. One particularly striking part of this performance was the way Perlman’s fingers snaked back-and-forth so rapidly across the neck of his violin. The rapid patterns of digit movement are a part of any string instrument performance. Seeing an instrumentalist without an orchestra or a rock band, however, really emphasizes how much energy and finesse goes into just those two hands, one sawing furiously and the other manipulating the strings.</p>\n<p>As the final scheduled songs conclude the audience leaps to their feet. Not that Ax and Perlman weren’t deserving, but the standing ovation feels routine at this point. I have never been to a performance of classical music where one wasn’t given. It almost feels as if rather than being moved by a performance, audiences dole out their standing ovations to beg for more music. If so, that’s alright, because it works. Ax strolled back out, followed by Perlman’s motorized transport. The two affably bantered about the different pieces they prefer to play. Perlman’s voice resounded with a booming, deep bass. His voice made his older, shrunken figure incredibly formidable, despite the fact that with his loose black clothing his closest visual analog is Noam Chomsky wearing a trash bag.</p>\n<p>David Fickes, a UCSB student and an anomalous under-40 patron, spoke to us about his experiences with Perlman and his music. As a teenager David played with a youth orchestra which hosted Perlman as a guest conductor.</p>\n<p>“They invited some local Vermont teens … I remember sitting about eight feet from this conductor,” he said. “It was the first time I heard music that brought me to tears.”</p>\n<p>The older patrons of the Granada seemed particularly happy to see younger audience members. I wondered if David got the same comments I did about how great it was to see people my age there. Many of the older attendees spoke about the necessity of maintaining culture and beautiful music. Some spoke about how art gets lost and these traditions have to continue. As far as new generations continuing the traditions of classical music, David described his experience as a teenager learning with Perlman for just a day or two.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the reasons I’m at UCSB as a performance major.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67739\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67739\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/tradition-and-culture-converge-with-itzhak-perlman-and-emanuel-ax/","id":6825,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6824,6823,6822],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mariachi Metal Group Metalachi Rocks Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/png-1-355x230.","mobile_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/png-1-980x647.","description":"A young man gets up on stage.

He wears a loose-fitting, colorful button-down. I speak with his mother, Sherry Mandell, about the organic produce company she works for. Her son belts out: “This place seems sober as fuck!” Between songs, he calls out to the audience. “Who fucked up this week? Raise your hand if you fucked up this week. If you’re not raising your hand, you’re lying.” I wonder if he includes his mother in this. He is the lead vocalist for the band Pookie, the first warm-up act for Metalachi. In case anyone needed clearing up on the band’s title, the man whose mother is in the audience clarifies. “Pookie — like the crack pipe, like the vagina, like your dog — Pookie.”</p>\n<p>Thus begins the show Friday night, Jan. 22 at Velvet Jones. As bizarre as this stage performance is to give in front of your mother, in person, it was relatively ingratiating. It also characterized the show perfectly. The main act Metalachi, a mariachi-metal fusion band (the world’s first and only) lives and breathes inappropriate comedy. Pookie’s frontman fits right in. The band’s music blares from the speakers.

I’m more blues, classic rock; the bass player and drummer they like metal and reggae, and the singer likes a lot of pop music.”</p>\n<p>Rather than hurting the band, the potpourri of influences helps it create a unique style. Forrest himself is good. During the act, several people tell me how much they like the guitar. His deft navigation of musical styles stands out.</p>\n<p>Finally, Metalachi takes the stage. Metalachi personifies showmanship. Their act is at least as much about the costumes, humor and performance as it is the music. Which isn’t to say the music isn’t good — it is. But singer Vega de la Rockha and trumpeter El Cucuy’s seemingly improvised comedic dialogues comprise the foundation of the performance. De la Rockha opens the act with a shoutout to our own prestigious institution. “Santa Barbara — the college — they’re known for their parties here,” and then after a moment: “They’re also known for their high levels of STDs!”</p>\n<p>And that pretty much sums up Metalachi.</p>\n<p>If you shy away from politically incorrect comedy, Metalachi is not for you. From musing about how “Caitlyn Genders” changed her car out for a garage, to warning patrons not to light a match because of the pervasive mac ’n’ cheese farts in the club (referring to Velvet Jones’s iconic nighttime snack), to lauding “Star Wars” for “incorporating Mexicans into the story” (Oscar Isaac is actually Guatemalan and Cuban), Metalachi exudes irreverence. At one point, El Cucuy refers to Donald Trump and begins a “Fuck that puto!” chant. Velvet Jones’s patrons happily participate.</p>\n<p>Metalachi’s music meshes the classical instrumentation of mariachi music with the catchy melodies of famous rock hits. While metal certainly influences their work, it’s metal in the broadest sense of the word. The band plays hits like “Sweet Child O’ Mine” (“dedicated to all the vatos still paying child-support”) and “I Wanna Rock N Roll All Night.” And it works. The trumpet, violin, guitarrón and guitar end up being the perfect instruments for rock ’n’ roll. Guest violinist “Queen Queef” (as she’s introduced by the other members of the band) stands out for her visceral style with the bow. The band clearly knows each other’s rhythms, too. They have a lot of chemistry, reacting immediately to the conclusions of De la Rockha’s and El Cucuy’s extended joke rifts.</p>\n<p>The band seems at its best pivoting off of these comedic interludes. The members leap into action. Guitarrón player Nacho Picante looks especially energetic, bouncing up and down with his instrument.</p>\n<p>Metalachi at Velvet Jones brought more than a mix of musical styles to the stage. They brought a show. From El Cucuy’s shout out to cougars to guitarist Paco Halen’s pelvic gyrations, this band makes sure what they have isn’t just a musical act, but a <em>performance</em>. At the end the group pays tribute. De la Rockha extols recently deceased Motörhead singer Lemmy Kilmister.</p>\n<p>“This song is dedicated to him, he’s probably checking us out from … I don’t know, hell.”</p>\n<p>The crowd loves it. Metalachi knows hell can be sexy.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-2GikwGEfA</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

another named “mariachi music,” the resulting Venn-diagram intersection would be labeled “Metalachi.” The band of the same name takes that premise of genre-blending and runs with it. Metalachi is comprised of (according to them), five identical quintuplet brothers who spent the first 14 years of their lives wandering from Veracruz to Juárez on donkey-back. Upon stumbling into Texas, the brothers unearthed a Black Sabbath record and a passion for music was born.</p>\n<p>Actually, if you look at Metalachi’s website, you’ll find that almost every detail of their biography entails fairly fantastical boasts. Their mythology ranges from guitarist Ramon Holiday’s claim to have lost his virginity to a burrito at age 11, to trumpeter El Cucuy’s vow to forge a “mega trumpet” out of his 2,000 existing trumpets (it will allegedly have the ability to rob Lady Gaga of her power as well as destroy entire cities).</p>\n<p>If you’re interested as to whether the band was actually abandoned by their sumo-wrestling mother after a horse-tranquilizer addled pregnancy, then you should come to the Velvet Jones this Friday, Jan. 22 at 8p.m. There will be no shortage of theatricality. The band’s outfits range from simple black crop-top and face paint combinations, to full-on KISS replica costumes. Their music itself involves mariachi covers of famous metal and rock songs. The band mixes classic rock staples like Led Zeppelin’s “Immigrant Song” with heavy metal hits like Iron Maiden’s “Run to the Hills.” Metalachi boasts guitars as befitting of typical mariachi music, complementing these with trumpet, violin and guitarrón (big Mexican guitar). While their style remains firmly mariachi, they also manage to replicate some metal sounds with acoustic instruments.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Metalachi clearly belongs in a pantheon of musical hybrids along with Beatallica (Beatles and Metallica mashups) and Tragedy (metal renditions of Bee Gee’s songs).

Organizers and fans touted the evils of racism and corporatism while drinking beers in the dimly lit restaurant. The vibe encompassed the mood of a punk concert, a coffee shop full of grumbling radicals and a rally against the World Trade Organization all in one. Attendees and artists browsed the Bonfire’s piles of zines, with names ranging from <em>Build Your Own Solidarity Network</em> to <em>Alternatives to Police</em>.</p>\n<p>Lia Rose of Built for the Sea opened the show. Unfortunately due to illness, Daniel Mackenzie, the other member of Built for the Sea, could not play. Rose stoically adapted her set to that of a solo act, strumming alternative-rock and folk music. The act undoubtedly lost some of the band’s more unique influences without Mackenzie’s instrumentals. With just a guitar and her voice, Rose appeared to be a version of the indie-songstress we’ve all heard at open mic nights. Fortunately she sang and played like the best possible version of that familiar image. Rose reminds us why only a few people get to be professional singers. Harvey energetically endorsed his fellow musician with the perfect description while on stage: “Her voice sounds like it’s auto-tuned but it’s not — it’s just perfect.”</p>\n<p>Harvey himself took the stage next, accompanied by English-born Kareem Samara. Samara plucked away on a Middle Eastern stringed instrument called the oud, while Harvey belted out familiar folk-protest sounds. The duo began with “Light in the Morning,” a song especially memorable for its surprising and poetic story. “Light in the Morning” described protestors rallying in Ferguson, Greece, Egypt, Turkey and Palestine, and how all of them were tear-gassed with the same type of canisters from the exact same tear-gas company. Harvey emphasized how these disparate groups of people around the world were brought together from this shocking coincidence. Harvey continued his stream of polemical protest songs. The act covered topics like the crisis facing Syrian refugees in “Omar” and the struggle of Kurdish forces against ISIS with “Rojhava.” An audience member, Jake “Pitstop” Roozen, gave his reason for coming to see Harvey. “Crawling out of my tent at Occupy Honolulu, listening to him gave me the little bit of hope I needed to keep going,” said Roozen.</p>\n<p>Following Harvey, solo act Bell’s Roar played a blend of signature soul-influenced electronic music. Sean Desiree drums, plays base, plays guitar and produces all of her own music for Bell’s Roar. She began her act by turning on her computer and playing the music she composed before spinning into a dance on stage. Desiree twirled and spun with lithe, acrobatic movements. For a few moments no one played anything as she danced to her own music. She broke the spell and began to sing. Desiree’s set covered a range of political topics. From the stage she described her recent travels touring in the Midwest and the cultural anxiety there surrounding people of color and others not following conventional gender norms. Before one song, Desiree called out “I try to call on my ancestors.” She also emphasized the Black Lives Matter movement with her song “Black Lives.” Most of all Desiree embodies movement. By her third song she stepped down from the stage and danced with the audience members. Desiree was kind enough to speak with the <em>Nexus</em>. “It’s about connecting with people. When you’re on stage there’s this barrier,” Desiree said.</p>\n<p>Finally The Last Internationale closed out the show. Delila Paz and Edgey Pires, the duo that comprises the band, broadcast total punk energy. On stage they jolted and jumped in tandem with the harder guitar sensibilities of their rebel rock. Each gives the impression of someone who would tell you as an adolescent that you should stick it to the man or fight the power. One song, “1968,” took its name from the French revolution of the same year. Introducing the song, Pires told the audience about the graffiti that inspired it. The graffiti, from the Sorbonne at the former University of Paris, reads, “The more I make love, the more I want to make revolution. The more I make revolution, the more I want to make love.” The slogan suited The Last Internationale’s ethos perfectly. By the time the harder punk sounds blasted from the stage, a larger crowd had accumulated next to it. “1968” ended the show, but by that time everyone was standing and rocking out.</p>\n<p>The way the musicians spoke about each other united them. They spoke about finding community with the other artists of Firebrand. Lia Rose, who also spoke with the <em>Nexus</em>, put it poignantly. “I found this family,” said Rose. From on stage, Harvey described Firebrand as more of an activist collective than a record label. All indications from the show say the same. Firebrand began in June and only has higher to rise. As long as Harvey and Morello sign artists who have messages they care about, their label has only success ahead.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/","id":6860,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6859,6858,6857],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Firebrand Record Label To Bring Politics and Music Coming to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fbsamplervol1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fbsamplervol1.jpg?resize=400%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Ryan Harvey of the Riot Folk Collective and Tom Morello, the guitarist for Rage Against the Machine, are coming to SOhO on Nov. 16.

The duo aims to capitalize on the Che Guevara T-shirt-wearing, Occupy Wall Street spirit with their roster of up-and-coming underground musicians. Boasting a smattering of genres, from folk to hip hop to punk rock, and a variety of artists, from Harvey himself to Ramy Essam, the most famous musician to arise out of the rebel music scene of the Arab Spring, their label Firebrand Records launched in June.</p>\n<p>Ryan Harvey was kind enough to speak with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> and offer some insights into the realm of underground, politically motivated music. “So we’re just like watching the World Cup, and I was like, ‘Dude, let’s start a record label,’” Harvey said. Harvey reached out to his fellow folk activists and contacts in the world of radical left political music, and with Morello birthed a new label.</p>\n<p>Harvey himself will perform at SOhO on the 16th, along with three other musicians from the Firebrand label. “These are artists that not a lot of folks have heard of and have been doing stuff in the underground music world for a long time,” said Harvey.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Last Internationale alternates classic rock and punk influences with their energetic and often melodic rebel-rock sensibilities. Their sole album, <em>We Will Reign</em>, features a slew of radical, fist-pumping denunciations of all things corporate and militaristic. When a band writes a song called “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Indian Blood,” you know you’re in for hardcore protest music. They even have an album review from Bill Ayers, the 1960s “terrorist” who the Republicans tried to tie Obama to in 2008.</p>\n<p>Built for the Sea remains the least political of the four bands, but still uses their haunting melodic style to take on global warming with “Sinking Ship.” The band pairs indie rock vocals with ambient electronic sounds to craft a unique style.</p>\n<p>Bell’s Roar blends a unique mix of synth-pop, soul and electronic influences to create poetic compositions. Sean Desiree’s Bronx roots shine through, and her music becomes a medium with which to explore issues of her genderqueer identity.</p>\n<p>Ryan Harvey himself is all folk. Like an angrier, shriller Bob Dylan, he pursues corporate oppression with a vengeance and an acoustic guitar. Harvey often builds up frenzied and frenetic melodies vilifying American foreign policy and racist ideologies. No stranger to activism, Harvey touts the message of his anti-war organization, the Civilian-Soldier Alliance, along with a host of other topics. “I’ve got things about the refugee crisis and things about the Arab Spring protests and Black Lives Matter,” Harvey said.</p>\n<p>The Firebrand label aims to reintroduce many mainstays of the underground folk and activist music worlds. The upcoming show offers the opportunity to see these artists on their way to taking their radical messages and cutting-edge sounds to more mainstream audiences. “It’s a chance to hear hard-hitting music about relevant current events and issues, and given that we’re in such a political time period right now in the world and in the country, we’re trying to complement that in song,” Harvey said. The show promises to be both thought provoking and entertaining, and Harvey makes going or not going an ultimatum: “I don’t know when it will happen again in that area.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5_qUJG8tgQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/firebrand-record-label-to-bring-politics-and-music-coming-to-soho/","id":6853,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6852,6851,6850],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/407"}},"__N_SSG":true}
