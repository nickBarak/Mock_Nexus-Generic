Despite his slight build and young face, he seemed to be highly confrontational and looked to be itching for a fight.</p>\n<p>Before he could find that perfect someone, though, he ran into I.V.’s finest. The officers asked the pugnacious punk his age and he truthfully replied that he was 15.</p>\n<p>The officers saw that the 15-year old kid, who was in town visiting his brother, was carrying a backpack and asked him what was in it. He told them, “It’s just water in there. You can search it if you want.”</p>\n<p>The officers, not wanting to refuse an invitation, opened the bag and found an open, nearly empty fifth of Taaka Vodka.</p>\n<p>Upon seeing the deputy remove the alcohol from his backpack, the young gun quickly retorted, saying “Hey! How’d that get in my backpack? I was only carrying water. They must have put that vodka in there.”</p>\n<p>Not caring to get to the bottom of this case, the officers cited the young whippersnapper with a minor in possession, as well as being out past curfew, and released him to his brother, pending harsher punishment from his mother.</p>\n<p>Shrubbery Showdown<br>\nFri., May 16, 12:18 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Pasado Road witnessed a man ungracefully weaving in and out of foot traffic.</p>\n<p>So intoxicated was the young man that many of his fellow Friday night revelers stopped and watched him as he attempted to walk down the street.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he also drew the gaze of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, who stopped the unsteady stroller.</p>\n<p>A deputy advised the 18-year-old male that he was very intoxicated and told the tipsy trotter that he wanted a word with him. The intoxicated male attempted to say something in return, but his words were completely incoherent.</p>\n<p>The officer sat the tongue-tied man on the curb, but he immediately fell backwards into a rather large bush. Sitting back up, the drunkard attempted to say his name but once again could not be understood.</p>\n<p>Fearing words wouldn’t get them any farther, the deputy asked if the man had ID. The drunk managed to answer “no.”</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked the man if he could walk home, and received a “yes” in return. Yet when he attempted to stand up, gravity won the battle and the drunk found himself back in the bushes – and into a pair of handcuffs.</p>\n<p>While awaiting his trip to the jail at the IVFP substation, the man had more issues sitting, this time mistaking a trashcan for a chair. Luckily he was too drunk to be embarrassed, and was eventually transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Two Cups, One Hangover<br>\nSat., May 17, 5:19 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to the 6500 block of Cordoba Road on reports of a subject trying to gain entrance to an apartment complex.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived on the scene a few minutes later and went around to the back of the apartment complex, where they found the 19-year-old perpetrator hunched over a large puddle of his own vomit.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the defeated reveler where he was and he answered by saying his last name aloud. His answer was the same when asked where he was from.</p>\n<p>Hoping for a different answer, the deputies asked him where he was once more, and he incorrectly told them “Del Playa.” Not a bad guess, they conceded.</p>\n<p>Next on the list of questions was his date of birth, which the drunkard told the officers was “six, six.” The deputy then asked how much alcohol he had consumed and he said, “two cups.”</p>\n<p>Comfortable with their decision, the officers arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16908\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16908\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/","id":3752,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3751,3750,3749],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sheriff Brown Wants Crowded Inmates Off Floor, in Jail Beds","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The stress on Santa Barbara County jails over the past decade has almost busted the concrete foundations on which the nearly impenetrable fortresses rest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The stress on Santa Barbara County jails over the past decade has almost busted the concrete foundations on which the nearly impenetrable fortresses rest.

As the years have gone by and the county population has grown, the number of jail cells has remained almost constant, he said. Throughout his campaign, and during his first 100 days in office, Brown has placed the blame squarely on outdated infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“The crux of the problem is that our jail infrastructure was built in the 1970s, and has had minimal additions,” Brown said.  “Our infrastructure has been outpaced by our population growth.”</p>\n<p>Along with overcrowding, the aging facilities have created a slew of other problems for the county, Brown said. Most drastically, the Sheriff’s Dept. has been forced to shorten non-violent criminals’ stays in the county jail, just to ensure that more inmates can fit in.</p>\n<p>“We have had to adjust our criteria for who we incarcerate and how long they stay. People that should be in jail aren’t,” Brown said. “When this starts happening, you start to lose the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.”</p>\n<p>Due to a cap on the numbers of prisoners allowed in each facility and a California Superior Court ruling, the county only has one other option besides releasing non-violent prisoners early – incarcerate fewer people.</p>\n<p>The county has sentenced law-breakers to other punitive programs, but the net effect is, as 3rd District Supervisor Brooks Firestone put it, that there are people on the streets that were sentenced to not be on the streets.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor Nikki Jones, who has a Ph.D. in criminology and teaches at UCSB, sees the situation in a different light. Since jails across the state are overflowing, and the crime rate has dropped, the problem, Jones said, does not lie in the size of county jails but instead in the criminal justice system itself.</p>\n<p>“Over the last decade or so, the crime rate has dropped off significantly from record highs in the early ’90s and late ’90s,” she said. “This introduces a serious contradiction: Why is it that our incarcerated population continues to grow even though crime isn’t increasing?”</p>\n<p>“Tough on crime” policies and mandatory sentences like the Three Strikes rule have more than made up for the drop in criminal activity, Jones said.</p>\n<p>“These policy changes increase the number of men and women who are incarcerated in our nation’s jails and prisons and puts pressure on local institutions, like county jails, that do not have the infrastructure to warehouse – as many of our facilities now do – the large numbers of people who enter its doors,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the cause, Firestone said the problem has gotten so bad that there are 10 to 20 more convicts than there are beds every night in the county jail, forcing prisoners to spend the night on the ground.</p>\n<p><b>Possible Solutions</b></p>\n<p>In lieu of overhauling the entire criminal justice system, the most obvious solution for officials has been to build a new prison. The idea has been raised many times and in increasing fervor as the overcrowding has become more severe.</p>\n<p>The most popular plan of the moment calls for the new jail to be built in the northern portion of the county, near Santa Maria. Sheriff Brown, whose campaign pushed the jail issue hard, said the proposed North County jail could house 800 inmates, and decisively solve the overcrowding problem.</p>\n<p>But, naturally, it would not be cheap.</p>\n<p>The daunting $153 million price tag – which would also include an estimated annual operation cost of anywhere from $19 to 30 million – has kept the facility from becoming a reality.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors, which is ultimately in charge of the funding, feels that the bill is too steep, and Firestone said the public agrees. According to the supervisor, a poll was given to the public asking whether they would be in favor of an increase in the sales tax to fund the proposed prison – the poll came back a resounding “no.”</p>\n<p><b>State-Funded Jail</b></p>\n<p>However, recent state legislation has given Brown another shot at fulfilling his campaign promises. Under a deal reached last month between the governor and state legislators, $7.4 billion of state funds will go into prison and rehabilitation programs, and $1.2 billion of that has been earmarked for local jail beds – the largest sum of money ever allocated by the state for jails.</p>\n<p>Due to the severity of area’s problem and the amount of work the county has already put into trying to solve it, Santa Barbara is well positioned to receive some of those funds, Brown said.</p>\n<p>The proposed state-funded facility would have 800 beds and the county would only have to pay for three-eighths of the construction and a portion of the operational costs.</p>\n<p>But, as Firestone and Brown have both said, “The devil is in the details.” The catch is that of the 800 total beds, 500 would be reserved for state prisoners, as opposed to county prisoners. The legislature also requires that the facility would have a re-entry station, aimed at better preparing convicts for their re-entry into society.</p>\n<p>The opposition has argued that the state funding comes with too many strings attached, but Brown argues the prison would still be a great benefit.</p>\n<p>“Sure there could be some additional costs, but we would benefit from an economy of scale. We are getting a long-term solution for a much smaller cost,” Brown said. “It is a great benefit to us to accept a joint facility with the state.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, with the current recidivism rate – the percentage of released prisoners that return to committing crimes and are caught – at 70 percent, Brown and state legislators have applauded the required re-entry stations.</p>\n<p>The high recidivism rate is a particular problem for Jones, who said that educational programs inside prisons would help reduce the number of readmissions.</p>\n<p>“Since 95 percent of people who enter jails and prison eventually are released, and our jails and prisons – especially in California – offer little educational or treatment programs for people who are incarcerated, we have set a large number of men and women up for failure once they are released from these facilities,” she said.</p>\n<p><b>For Now</b></p>\n<p>To help persuade the public to accept the deal, Brown has created a “blue-ribbon” panel of experts from various disciplines to look into the proposed solutions. He said he hopes that the public will see the multi-disciplined group and know that the sheriff is not just asking the county for unnecessary funds, but that the proposal is well researched and well founded. He believes that this approach is much more marketable to the public.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, at least until the North County jail issue is solved, Brown is looking for short-term solutions.</p>\n<p>One of his originally proposed options is already off the table. On the campaign trail, Brown proposed shipping inmates over to a vacant jail facility in Tulare County, which was empty due to a lack of funding in the county. Since then, the county has procured funds, and all beds in the jail are accounted for.</p>\n<p>Now, the sheriff’s short-term solutions include an agreement with the Lompoc City Jail to house county inmates; efforts to use more home incarcerations; a remodeling of older facilities; and a change of the Lompoc County holding facility from a Type I facility to a Type II facility. The change would allow the facility to hold prisoners for longer than the current 96-hour limit, he said.</p>\n<p>But no matter what the county builds, Jones said the underlying societal problems will remain.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, this is not a problem that we can build our way out of,” she said.</p>\n<p>Until jails offer college courses, General Education Development programs, mental health and addiction treatments, the problem will never truly be solved, Jones said.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately,” she said, “the real solution to this problem must come from outside the criminal justice system.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14072\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14072\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/","id":3554,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3553,3552,3551],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/265"}},"__N_SSG":true}
