For Nausicaä and the surviving inhabitants of the Earth, life is dominated by interactions with the ever-growing Toxic Jungle that was spawned in the aftermath of the war. The Jungle and the massive insects that evolved to protect it threaten mankind with extinction as they relentlessly consume the remaining human kingdoms, which are plagued by war and starvation. Confronted with this bleak reality, Princess Nausicaä devotes herself to understanding the mysteries of the Toxic Jungle to see if there is any hope for humanity to coexist with the Jungle and its giant insect guardians.</p>\n<p>Miyazaki cements his trademark motif of strong female lead characters in the film, with Princess Nausicaä Kushana fighting to defend the relatively prosperous Valley of the Wind from an invading army led by Princess Kushana, who seeks to revive a “Giant Warrior” from the Seven Days of Fire 1000 years prior. With the misguided plan of using it to “burn down the Toxic Jungle” and destroy the insects, Kushana battles with the militaries of other kingdoms in a desperate struggle for control of the Warrior and the fate of the planet. Ironically, as Nausicaä later discovers, the monstrous Giant Warriors and their weapons helped create the Toxic Jungle in the first place and that the Jungle is actually purifying the Earth of mankind’s past pollution.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The film’s strong environmental message, while laid on thick, is delivered in such a compelling and frightening manner it makes James Cameron’s “Avatar” and “Elysium” look like child’s play. In “Nausicaä,” the consequences of ecological degradation are taken to far more horrifying extremes, with the end of the human race seemingly inevitable. Despite the doom and gloom atmosphere, Princess Nausicaä’s optimism (or naïveté) that a different future is possible both bewilders and inspires.</p>\n<p>“Nausicaä” also conveys a subtler, yet equally powerful anti-nuclear message. In one of the most bizarre and mesmerizing scenes of the film, Kushana deploys a prematurely hatched Giant Warrior, essentially a living tactical nuclear weapon, against a stampeding horde of attacking insects with devastating effect. Kushana’s lieutenant, upon witnessing the enormous explosion caused by the Warrior remarks, “Incredible, no wonder the Earth was incinerated.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Casey Coffee agreed the Giant Warrior was “allegorical for nuclear war,” given the context of the director’s early childhood living in Japan during the Second World War.</p>\n<p>“When it shot the beam out of its mouth, that explosion was definitely reminiscent of a cloud of destruction, and since Hayao Miyazaki is Japanese, I could definitely make a connection,” Coffee said.</p>\n<p>Every scene of the film is set upon a beautifully hand-painted background that brings each frame to life. The steampunk-style anime crafted by Miyazaki in the film creates a visually stunning futuristic world in which certain aspects of technology are far advanced, most notably Princess Nausicaä’s jet glider, while others remain primitive and medieval in style. Soldiers wield swords, wear plated armor and tunics, yet simultaneously drive tanks and pilot fighter jets. The contrast and contradiction between elements of the new and the old feel increasingly natural as plot unfolds and the verisimilitude kicks in. Somehow, Miyazaki makes it work.</p>\n<p>Second-year English major Hue-An Tran said she appreciated the unique, intentionally over-the-top style used by Miyazaki in “Nausicaä.”</p>\n<p>“The comicbook-style action sequences I thought was pretty retro and cool, because I know a lot of his other films aren’t like that,” Tran said.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most fantastic feature of “Nausicaä” is its beautiful original score by composer Joe Hisaishi, which elevates the emotional impact of the films most gripping scenes, and is occasionally nothing short of enchanting. Though the film was originally released in 1984, it was masterfully dubbed in English and rereleased in 2005, with voiceovers from an impressive A-list cast including Patrick Stewart, Uma Thurman, Shia LaBeouf, Edward James Olmos and Mark Hammond.</p>\n<p>More than 30 years later, “Nausicaä” remains a must-see for anyone with a taste for epic storytelling, quality science-fiction or just film in general. If you limit yourself from seeing this film because you “don’t like anime,” then you are missing out on a true work of art. There is a reason “Nausicaä” was selected as one of the few animated films screened by Turner Classic Movies because, at the end of the day, it is just a damn good movie.</p>\n<p>The event was hosted as part of an ongoing series through the Environmental Humanities Initiative. The next movie to be shown by the group will be “Princess Mononoke” on May 28.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63838\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63838\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/","id":5935,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[5934,5933,5932],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cupp Discusses Freedom of Speech","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Conservative commentator and New York Daily News writer Sarah Elizabeth Cupp spoke about the importance of freedom of speech and the political culture surrounding it to students and community members ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_63257\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63257\" data-attachment-id=\"63257\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/cupp-discusses-freedom-of-speech/cupp_christina-demarzo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Cupp_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431022366\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"125\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"S.E.

Cupp explained her transition from a liberal in college to a conservative later in life, articulated her positions on everything from trigger warnings to feminism and finally held a Q&amp;A session.</p>\n<p>Cupp said her preconceived notions of Republicans and the prevailing negative stereotypes associated with the party did not match her personal experiences.</p>\n<p>“Republicans, I had learned from popular culture, were greedy, racist, sexist, dumb, warmongers, crooks and liars,” Cupp said. “This was before George W. Bush even came along — and I of course was none of those things.”</p>\n<p>Cupp said the incident in which feminist studies Professor Miller-Young attacked a pro-life 16-year-old demonstrator last year indicated that liberal progressives did not support the principles of free speech.</p>\n<p>“When college professors of all people think it’s appropriate education to steal and tear up the sign of a peaceful protestor, regardless of what they are protesting, you know that progressives have totally abandoned their one-time commitment to free speech,” Cupp said.</p>\n<p>Cupp said she felt the effort by UCSB students to provide trigger-warnings to students for graphic content pertaining to sexual assault and extreme violence was “insane” and unrealistic.</p>\n<p>“It only sounds somewhat legitimate because you’re living in it, but to anyone in the real world that’s insane,” Cupp said. “I mean there’s no threat that you’re going to cause me to cause myself physical harm … with something you say. The fact that people buy this is crazy.”</p>\n<p>Cupp said American society has developed with the primary goal of not offending any individual.</p>\n<p>“We have become a society that aims to offend exactly, precisely, no one,” Cupp said. “If one person is offended it’s too much. That’s crazy.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jason Garshfield said he supported every point made by Cupp, but that he would have preferred a larger audience at the event.</p>\n<p>“I think she’s on to something big and I agree with everything she said,” Garshfield said. “I do think it’s somewhat limited in the fact that everyone here from the Republicans is aware of the problems she’s talking about and what we need to do is not just come together and talk about them, but to come together and find solutions to them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Alice Gilbert said the event’s purpose was to remind students of the importance of universities as bastions of free expression.</p>\n<p>“It’s important for students to remember that the university setting is possibly the freest place of thought that exists,” Gilbert said.</p>\n<p>Local resident James Barton said he appreciated an opportunity to listen to a different political perspective.</p>\n<p>“I think she was here to share her opinion of freedom of speech and deliver her point of view.

Senate, by a secret vote of six-to-one, a resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in the Israel-Palestine region.</p>\n<p>The one dissenting vote, made public shortly after the vote was taken, came from off-campus Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh. The resolution, sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), urges the UC Board of Regents to withdraw its investments from companies selling arms and weapons to the Israeli government for or by the Israeli military on the grounds that such companies profit off of the military occupation of Palestinian-controlled territories, and that such investments are contrary to the obligation of the UC to promote equality and human rights for all.</p>\n<p>This is the third year in a row a divestment resolution related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been brought before the Senate, with prior iterations of the bill defeated in the past two years. The Senate is expected to vote on the resolution at their weekly meeting next Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the idea of tabling the resolution came in light of Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, which takes place next Wednesday and Thursday.</p>\n<p>“While this resolution has been moved to committee and is expected to go out to the student senate, there are those who bring forward the idea that there is a Jewish holiday next week that would require it to be pushed another week,” Goodman said. “There is no one who is not Jewish who can tell me or the Jewish community that our holiday … is a reason not to bring this forward.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said he urged action on the resolution in order to allow the Senate to move forward on to other issues and also opposed further postponing a vote on the resolution.</p>\n<p>“Actually, it’s really patronizing for someone to have proposed that there are Jewish reasons, … that they, out their sensitivity for me and my community, would not want to bring it up,” Goodman said. “So I urge you to pass this out of committee so the Senate can deal with it and the campus can go on to dealing with this and other issues.”</p>\n<p>SJP member Nia, who requested to not have her full name disclosed, said she supported tabling the resolution for an additional week in light of Yom HaShoah.</p>\n<p>“It’s SJP’s mission to work against all forms of oppression, so we feel it’s really important to recognize that and honor that day for all Jewish students, and just let them know that we stand in solidarity … and recognize that and push it back another week so that it’s not at a time when a lot of people are sensitive,” Nia said.</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Niki Elyasi said she found it “patronizing” and “offensive” to push the resolution vote back another week.</p>\n<p>“First of all, the week after week four, April 23rd, is Yom Hazikaron [Day of Remembrance for the Fallen Soldiers of Israel and Victims of Terrorism], so if you are doing your Jewish holiday searching you didn’t do an amazing job because … you’d have to wait ’til week five if that’s your logic,” Elyasi said. “Also to say that you are standing in solidarity with Jewish students when Jewish students feel attacked by a resolution that you’re bringing up to me is just a little bit ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said she was concerned about the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement’s insistence upon the “Right of Return” for the 700,000 Palestinian refugees that are said to have been forcibly removed or evacuated from the territory that now constitutes the political boundaries of Israel.</p>\n<p>“If the Palestinians who no longer live in Israel were to return to Israel that would mean Israelis would be a minority, so Israel would cease to exist in its current state,” Moreh said. “To my understanding, that would mean the end of Israel.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and co-author of the divestment resolution Anumita Kaur defended the passage of the resolution and said allowing Palestinian refugees return would not threaten Israeli sovereignty.</p>\n<p>“We at SJP (Students for Justice in Palestine) absolutely stand by the Right of Return,” Kaur said. “We believe the people that were kicked out of their homeland have the right to return. However, I do challenge the notion that that would destroy the state of Israel altogether.”</p>\n<p>Kaur also said she believes in the right of self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that one people’s self-determination has to mean the end of another’s,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik said he advocated for the ability of students from both the Jewish and Palestinian community to make an effort to listen to empathize with one another.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been able to have real dialogue between both the Jewish community and the Palestinian community,” Abdalmalik said. “I highly encourage all of you, no matter how much you personally believe in your cause, to reach out across the aisle and to have open conversation that starts with unification between the two sides.”</p>\n<p>According to Abdalmalik, after engaging in discussion about divestment with students from both sides of the issue, he was able to find common ground.</p>\n<p>“I asked a lot of the folks in the Jewish community if you believe that the Palestinian people have the right to self-determination — and every one of you said yes,” Abdalmalik said. “And I asked the folks on the other side of the aisle if they believe the Jewish people have the right to self-determination — and they said yes. That, in it of itself, is such a good start to seeing how we can form a resolution that promotes both people’s rights to self-determination.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62289\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62289\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/divestment-resolution-passes-to-a-s-senate/","id":2815,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[2814,2813,2812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Event Takes Closer Look at ","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A panel of professors, public officials and graduate students spoke at an event titled ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60040\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60040\" data-attachment-id=\"60040\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/charlie-hebdo_alex-nagase-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?fit=1232%2C816&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1232,816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421953129\",\"copyright\":\"2012\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Charlie Hebdo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-60040\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60040\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Guest speakers, including French, Global Studies, and Religious Studies Faculty, a student, and the French Consulate General from Los Angeles, discussed this month’s attack on French satirical newspaper <em>Charlie Hebdo. Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>A panel of professors, public officials and graduate students spoke at an event titled <em>Charlie Hebdo: Defending Freedom of Speech and Fighting Islamophobia in France</em> Thursday evening in Buchanan Hall to discuss the ramifications of the terrorist attacks against the French satirical magazine <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> in Paris in early January.</p>\n<p>Sponsored by the French and Italian Department and the Arab Student Group on campus, the event included discussion on the social consequences of freedom of speech, the importance of interfaith dialogue and the political relationship between the West and the Greater Middle East. About 150 students, faculty and campus community members attended, with several audience members participating in a Q&amp;A session later in the evening that resulted in controversial debate.</p>\n<p>French Council General of Los Angeles Axel Cruau led a brief moment of silence to commemorate the 12 people killed in the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> shootings after speaking of the “heroism” displayed during follow up attacks on a Jewish supermarket days later.</p>\n<p>“We also saw in those moments of darkness, heroism, especially in the Kosher market,” Cruau said, “One of the employees, his name is Lassana Bathily, he is Muslim. He came from Mali. He saved hostages.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We may agree or disagree with its editorial policies, but just please remember, silence is the end of democracy. – Visiting Assistant Professor of French Studies Aude Jehan</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cruau said the millions of French people who gathered in unity rallies across the country “did the right thing” by protesting peacefully.</p>\n<p>“All over France, almost 4 million people gave the best answer possible to those terrorist attacks — they stood up and marched,” Cruau said. “They stood up and marched in a show of dignity, of brotherhood, to proclaim their commitment to freedom and to say a resolute ‘no’ to terrorism, to intolerance, to anti-Semitism, to racism.”</p>\n<p>Global studies professor Jan Nederveen Pieterse said geopolitical conflict was the catalyst for the events that unfolded at <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>.</p>\n<p>“Abu Grahib, Fallujah and Israel’s wars in Gaza, mentioned as motivation by the attackers in Paris, were cruel and extreme,” Pieterse said, “and extremists in the region and outside the region have responded in extreme ways, and both are unpardonable.”</p>\n<p>During the event, a slide show of some of <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>’s most controversial cartoons was shown, including one image showing a Nazi SS officer kissing a Hasidic Jew. Visiting Assistant Professor of French Studies Aude Jehan said the cartoon was made to criticize homophobic Nazi ideology and not to defame Jews or homosexuals.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a show of disrespect, but rather it shows a way to resist,” Jehan said. “Never did the publication ever call for any sort of violence.”</p>\n<p>Jehan said even if people are opposed to the content published in <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>, it is freedom of speech should be protected.</p>\n<p>“We may agree or disagree with its editorial policies, but just please remember, silence is the end of democracy,” Jehan said.</p>\n<p>Political Science graduate student Shyam Sriram said despite finding the caricatures of the prophet Mohammed “to be a form of Islamophobia,” that he, “as a Muslim,” was not offended because the Muslim community has far more significant issues to confront regarding human rights violations worldwide.</p>\n<p>“Instead of focusing so much on the cartoons, why don’t we start treating women with respect and dignity, speaking out on child marriage, female circumcision, honor killings and human trafficking?” Sriram said. “How about having an honest conversation about depression, suicide, mental health and substance abuse?”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60039\" style=\"width: 476px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60039\"

Paris are not representative of the Muslim community</p>\n<p>“I am proud to be Muslim … and I am ashamed that anyone would pretend to be Muslim and then carry out something so heinous in the name of Allah,” Sriram said.</p>\n<p>Professor of Religious Studies Kathleen Moore said the recent media depiction of a “Clash of Civilizations” has had deep ramifications for intercultural relations between the West and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“Often, unfortunately, when terrorist attacks like <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> occur, the same tired explanations are offered alongside a portrait of Islam and irrational radical Muslim rage contrasted with a rational, balanced pluralist and democratic West,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jessica Baker said the diversity of the event’s panel allowed for dynamic and constructive discourse on issues surrounding the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> incident in Paris.</p>\n<p>“Each different panelist teaches or has a different background and had a completely different perspective or something from history to introduce,” Baker said, “so I think if this school is going to open a dialogue about this, this is the best way to start it.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Primitivo Gonzalez said he it was refreshing to listen to people speak that have a personal connection to the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> events.</p>\n<p>“I’m really glad that we have the French Department faculty members here to give their piece on what they believe about <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> because we’re kind of stuck using American outlets, or BBC,” Gonzaez said. “It’s good to hear a human being that we can possibly relate to, from the local level.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are universal values, and they should be the norm everywhere. As a human being and citizen I hope you will agree with that. – French Council General of Los Angeles Axel Cruau</p></blockquote>\n<p>President of the Arab Student Group Nada Elshaari said it was exciting to see cooperation between two separate campus entities to facilitate a discussion on a current event.</p>\n<p>“Different student organization on campus are really acclimated to activism, so you get a lot of discussions like this all the time,” Elshaari said. “When an event like this roles around, where a student org and an academic department can work together, it’s just a good thing.”</p>\n<p>In a separate interview, Cruau said people across the globe should unite to protect freedom of speech in the wake of the attacks such as the incident at <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>.</p>\n<p>“We really hope freedom of the press will be defended worldwide, and that people will live up to their commitment,” Cruau said. “Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are universal values, and they should be the norm everywhere.

Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus.</p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate held their first meeting of the academic year this Wednesday in the Flying A room at the UCen.</p>\n<p>The meeting focused on discussions with University of California Police Department representatives, complaints of a lack of support for student organizations by the Rec Cen and an appeal for a new electoral process for Associated Students Senate elections.</p>\n<p>UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson informed the Senate that there would be increased police patrols on the weekends in Isla Vista and on campus.</p>\n<p>“A couple things that you might have noticed or heard about that we have underway are increased police patrols over the weekend, particularly on campus and in Isla Vista Thursday nights, Friday nights and Saturday nights,” Olson said. “We’re really trying to make sure the community feels safe and is safe.”</p>\n<p>Olson also said additional precautions would be taken during Halloween weekend, such as the presence of up to four times as many UCPD officers and drunk driving checkpoints.</p>\n<p>“We’re pulling a lot more UC officers into the operation than we’ve had in years past,” Olson said. “Say like, last year and years before that there was maybe like 25. This year we’re bringing in up to 100. These are UC officers from other UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>Olson answered questions from Senators regarding police policy towards people suspected of underage drinking.</p>\n<p>Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothschild asked if students were required to present identification to officers when on their own driveways and property. Olson responded by saying that students were not obligated to do so and would not be arrested if officers couldn’t prove that they were under age.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going tell you that you have to,” Olson said, “they’re not going to arrest you for being underage unless they know you’re underage.”</p>\n<p>Olson said UCPD was not looking to make students miserable or refrain from doing anything fun, but rather to simply behave in a responsible manner.</p>\n<p>“I’m not here to tell you that I don’t want you to have fun or do things that UCSB and college affords you to do, that’s just not right,” Olson said. “What we want you to do is be safe and make good decisions and be part of that success. I hope you know that and feel that when you see us out there … we’re not here to make your lives hard.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, members of the UCSB Cotillion Dance Club voiced complaints that the Rec Cen had taken action to make their club and its 100 members unable to practice.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major and Cotillion Dance Club member Letitia Mueller said actions taken by the Rec Cen to raise the price of renting rooms, thus making others unavailable altogether, has forced students to resort to practicing in unsafe locations such as parking lots.</p>\n<p>“This is dangerous. This is a liability,” Mueller said. “People are break-dancing in Lot 22. That’s so scary. People can break their necks, and it’s not okay. We need resource creation. We need a space to practice. There are no spaces for independent dance groups.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included a push to change Associated Student Senate’s election system, plans to improve mental health services at UCSB and successful voter registration drives on campus.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously incorrectly stated that the UCen Governance Board had implemented policies affecting the Cotillion Dance Club. That is incorrect. This department discussed in the Senate meeting was actually the Rec Cen.]</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, October 9, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56723\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56723\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/","id":3018,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3017,3016,3015],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"EAP Students Without Housing","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Dozens of students are still without permanent housing as Fall Quarter begins at UCSB.

Unusually high demand for housing has made it nearly impossible for students to find housing in Isla Vista, Goleta and even downtown Santa Barbara. Some students have resorted to staying in costly motels while they await assistance from the Community Housing Office (CHO), the university administration responsible for helping students find living accommodations.</p>\n<p>According to Community Housing Office Manager Roane Akchurin, in her 25 years of working with the CHO she could only recall one other year with a similar housing shortage situation, which was in 1989. According to Akchurin, approximately 100 students are still without housing, a shortage that did not become apparent to the CHO until a month ago.</p>\n<p>“It seemed like a normal year,” Akchurin said, “I’ve been here 25 years, up until August, then right when September hit we started getting phone calls from international students saying housing was tighter than usual.”</p>\n<p>Akchurin said the housing crunch has been the result of a multitude of factors outside of the University’s control.</p>\n<p>“It’s a way bigger issue than just UCSB,” Akchurin said. “There’s City College and Westmont students that impact the market place, as well as an influx of construction contractors working in Goleta that have added to the housing shortage.”</p>\n<p>According to Akchurin, her office has reached out to the broader community to provide housing for many afflicted students.</p>\n<p>“We sent a letter to local folks to ask people to come forward and provide housing, and the response has been amazing,” Aktchurin said. “The community has been great.”</p>\n<p>However, students like fourth-year international business major Daniel Luckyman remain homeless. A transfer student from Germany through EAP, Luckyman said he and another student from Germany have been looking relentlessly for housing for a month now.</p>\n<p>“We came here a month before to find housing,” Luckyman said, “We were here every day checking Craigslist and going house to house.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56415\" style=\"width: 206px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1967489030\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56367\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56415\" data-attachment-id=\"56415\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/eap-students-without-housing/eap-housing-mishap/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg?fit=1414%2C1802&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1414,1802\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"MG5300 series\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"EAP Housing Mishap\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg?fit=196%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg?fit=804%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56415 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap-196x250.jpg?resize=196%2C250\" alt=\"Upon arriving to Santa Barbara, many EAP students expecting to find university housing found themselves without homes.

The meeting began with a seven-minute moment of silence held in honor of the shooting victims.</p>\n<p>Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones reported on the successful efforts coordinated by A.S. executive officers to construct a board for students and community members to share thoughts and feelings in light of recent events. Jones said the board has received non-stop participation, particularly after media coverage in Isla Vista has subsided.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really, really beautiful thing,” Jones said. “We spent all day yesterday and today out there. It’s been a constant flow of students [and] community leaders … who are just coming forth, looking at it, participating, adding thoughts.”</p>\n<p>Third-year economics and accounting major and Internal Vice President Angela Lau said she has been working on several events to help students heal from the recent tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working nonstop from Saturday on the candlelight vigil, the memorial and other projects of healing on our campus,” Lau said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh discussed some of the problems that occurred with the UCSB emergency email message system on the Friday night of the shootings. Singh said Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown justified the delayed warnings students received that evening as an attempt to maintain peace.</p>\n<p>“He tried to make an excuse, and said something along the lines of ‘There was a safety concern, we didn’t want people to panic,’” Singh said. “To me, speaking personally, this kind of concerns me because this alert system is made for us to be notified for something like this going on.”</p>\n<p>Singh, a third-year political science and film and media double major, said students frequently receive alerts and warnings about relatively unimportant happenings.</p>\n<p>“We get police alerts all the time for smaller stuff, but we don’t get it when something like this happens,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Singh also said students should make a concerted effort to be aware of issues related to gun legislation.</p>\n<p>“With everything that’s been happening, just keep an eye on what’s going on with gun law legislations,” Singh said. “I know that’s been really big, especially [Tuesday] with the memorial. Today, Das Williams proposed his legislation and it was on CNN, so keep an eye on it. It’s something that’s relevant to our community.”</p>\n<p>Several different A.S. executive officers made efforts to reach out to senators to provide emotional support. A.S. President Ali Guthy, a third-year sociology and psychology double major, said she appreciated community efforts over the last week and would be available as a resource to senators and students.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s been a really rough week, and the amount of support we’ve been giving each other as a community has really been inspiring,” Guthy said. “I love you all. If you need anything I’m here as a resource.”</p>\n<p>Senators then passed a resolution to formally request that Chancellor Henry T. Yang ask First Lady Michelle Obama to appear at UCSB and speak on the recent tragedy. Senator Jimmy Villarreal, fourth-year communication major, said the first lady could provide support to the Isla Vista community during a difficult time.</p>\n<p>“In light of the most recent events, we need an inspirational speaker,” Villarreal said. “She will not be coming as a political figure, but as first lady of the United States. I like to think that’s like the mom of America. That’s what we need.”</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, fifth-year biological anthropology major Josh Plotke spoke at public forum to condemn newly appointed External Vice President of Local Affairs Beatrice Contreras for lying to the <em>Daily Nexus</em>, citing documented contradictory statements. He said Contreras, a third-year sociology and Asian-American studies double major, made incorrect statements regarding the legality of a sales tax and subsequently lied about making those statements.</p>\n<p>“Not only is it as bad as they said, not only did they quote her correctly, but it’s worse than they actually quoted her,” Plotke said. “I want you guys to just think before you take what she says as the truth. Just remember that she lied to the <em>Nexus</em>, she lied to me.”</p>\n<p>On former Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet’s request, Lau asked Plotke to leave for the remaining duration of the meeting, to which Plotke obliged.</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed included debate over Senate approval of staff positions for A.S. executives, planned study jams this evening at the A.S. Annex that will provide free food for students, a bill to create a commemorative memorial plaque for the victims of the shooting and the unanimous passage of a resolution to encourage more socially responsible investments by the UC, which had previously been passed unanimously by the outgoing Senate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/newly-elected-a-s-staff-holds-first-senate-meeting/","id":3016,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3015,3014,3013],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

It passed with nearly unanimous support, as only Senator Montana MacLachlan chose to abstain from the vote.</p>\n<p>Regarding the resolution, student sponsor of the legislation Guy Singer said the bill provided adequate leeway for the university to implement its demands without undue burden.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to give the UC Regents … and the treasury a lot of space with this,” Singer said. “Because it’s a big transition, we are giving them five years.”</p>\n<p>According to Singer, the goal is to get similar legislation passed at all UC campuses during the summer.</p>\n<p>Later, discussion on the bill to update A.S. election code began when Senator Ansel Lundberg read a letter aloud in support of the bill, which demands that a new single transferable vote (STV) system be implemented before the next A.S. election. The system would use preferential voting in which students would rank candidates according to favorability and would roll over votes of candidates that received less first-choice votes.</p>\n<p>Lundberg said the current election system led to an unfair domination by a single party that does not accurately represent students.</p>\n<p>“The fact that a single party has come to dominate the representation of the entire student body represents a failure on the part of UCSB’s Associated Students,” Lundberg said.</p>\n<p>Lundberg said the large numbers of voters that did not support the Open People’s Party were essentially disenfranchised by the current system. Lundberg said this exclusion is even more prominent after “two straight years of thousands of votes cast for DP candidates [led] to zero seats in the Senate.”</p>\n<p>MacLachlan said the STV system has a set of its own concerns, particularly in how it encourages for a competition in popularity between candidates and marginalizes political party influence.</p>\n<p>“I know that one issue that has been talked about is that if people ran more individually then it would turn into a popularity contest,” MacLachlan said. “What’s the counterargument to that?”</p>\n<p>In response, Lundberg said the new electoral system would not compromise the ability of parties to impact elections.</p>\n<p>“I would say that it still allows parties to thrive and in no way undermines parties … We’re not trying to ban parties,” Lundberg said.</p>\n<p>Senator Derek Wakefield said the outgoing Senate is currently in an ideal position to pass legislation affecting the electoral system, as they are less likely to be hindered by political affiliations.</p>\n<p>“We are going to be leaving next week, so that puts us in a really good position to change toward a system such as this because essentially elections and winning is not as much in our minds,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Wakefield also said the bill to change the A.S. elections process represents a significant, influential and final piece of legislation for this year’s Senate.</p>\n<p>“As our last act of Senate, we can change how we are represented,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Following discussion on the bill to update the A.S. elections code, a bill to update student lobby legal code was tabled after various senators expressed opposition to it.</p>\n<p>Senator John Soriano said he felt concerned that the bill violated the lobby’s autonomy.</p>\n<p>“It’s not fair for the board to be told what to do before they’ve even been elected,” Soriano said.</p>\n<p>Senator Lupe Zelada said the independence of the student lobby was being attacked. According to Zelada, the A.S. President backtracked on a previous agreement.</p>\n<p>“I do have a problem with somebody attacking our autonomy in our election process, especially when Jonathan Abboud gave us his word that he was not going change that or touch that,” Zelada said. “He completely just backed out on his word, and I don’t appreciate that.”</p>\n<p>Other items covered during the meeting included a planned online marketplace for UCSB students to trade and sell textbooks called GauchoBooks, upcoming Human Rights Board elections and changes in and the transition between outgoing and incoming senators.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/","id":3009,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3008,3007,3006],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

President’s 2014-2015 budget, undercover raids by the Isla Vista Foot Patrol and a plan to promote socially responsible investments of university funds.</p>\n<p>Next year’s budget proposal, roughly 10.7 million dollars, includes funding for staff members and student programs, marking an increase of $126 thousand over this year’s final budget. The bill was ultimately tabled for next week after an extensive debate over the reduced amount of money allocated for A.S. staff positions.</p>\n<p>A.S. staff member Aaron Jones said senators should “use their time wisely” when looking over the budget before approving it. He said many A.S. staff members were overwhelmed by the workload and putting in more hours than they were scheduled.</p>\n<p>“They all feel that they are doing more than is within their job description. I’ve asked them to do more because of the shortages we have in staff,” Jones said. “They do put in hours that are not necessarily accounted for.”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore gave a presentation to the A.S. Senate explaining some of the details behind the recent undercover operations by the Isla Vista Foot Patrol. Moore said that he has told officers that the undercover raids are not a productive way of policing Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“I mentioned to the law enforcement pretty strongly, as far as the community policing thing, this is, A, really unfortunate timing right after Deltopia because it feels like punishment, and B, just in general I feel like [it’s] not a very effective tool because all it will yield to is a bunch of [minor in possession]’s,” Moore said. “I feel that’s not something the community is very concerned about.”</p>\n<p>Moore also reported the results of the I.V. Needs Assessment Survey, a comprehensive poll that asks residents about their concerns for the community.</p>\n<p>“The number one priority for Isla Vista residents thus far is lighting and number two is affordable housing,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Moore said 91 percent of those polled reported that harassment was a consistent community problem.</p>\n<p>The Senate also voted unanimously to pass a resolution to create an ad-hoc committee to encourage UCSB to make socially responsible investment decisions based on human rights and environmental protection, among other criteria that remain to be determined. The resolution’s aim is to divest from corporations rated poorly in terms of corporate social responsibility by an independent group such as <i>The Economist</i>.</p>\n<p>Second-year biopsychology major Guy Singer said the resolution would do a great deal to repair some of the divisions that arose from the divestment meeting last week, citing bipartisanship support from American Support for Israel and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.</p>\n<p>“This specific resolution of the last few days has received a lot of input from both pro-Israel community and pro-BDS community to help bridge the gap between the pretty intense conflict that’s been present here for the last year,” Singer said. “This resolution is not only endorsed by leaders of both communities, but parts of it were written by both.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting were the release of an issue of UCSB’s <i>Campus Point</i> magazine, the Chilla Vista festival that will occur Saturday in Perfect Park and a senior citizen prom being sponsored by the Community Affairs Board. In addition, the Senate took a moment to sing Off-Campus Senator-elect Emani Oakley a happy birthday song.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55128\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55128\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/","id":3007,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3006,3005,3004],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The meeting was held at Corwin Pavilion to accommodate the large crowd expected due to last year’s divestment hearings, during which Senate meetings ran well into the early morning several weeks in a row before the resolution was ultimately struck down.</p>\n<p>Though sign-up for speaking at public forum closed at 8 p.m., senators decided to end public forum at 1 a.m. before completing the list of those scheduled to speak. Bill co-authors fourth-year Middle Eastern studies major Hani Tajsar and fourth-year Middle Eastern studies and political science major Katlen Abuata of Students for Justice for Palestine then read through the entire ten-page resolution in an attempt to clarify misunderstandings about the bill and answer questions from senators.</p>\n<p>Senators agreed to end debate at 3:33 a.m., at which point they held a vote to use a secret ballot on the resolution in an effort to protect senators from possible repercussions for their choice. The secret ballot went forward with the support of Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet, who provided the tie-breaking vote.</p>\n<p>The following ruling against divestment resulted in emotional demonstrations on both sides of the audience, which remained around 200 people. The crowd dispersed shortly after the announcement.</p>\n<p>The meeting continued until 4 a.m., allowing senators to briefly discuss and vote on a controversial bill to withdraw A.S. membership and funding from the United States Student Association. The resolution narrowly failed, meaning UCSB will continue its paid membership with USSA.</p>\n<p>Barbara Parmet of the Santa Barbara Chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace read a letter from the organization’s deputy director defending the use of the word “apartheid” in the resolution.</p>\n<p>“Israeli policies have already created a de facto single state, including all of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and Occupied East Jerusalem into one state built on the premise of separate and unequal lives for Jews and non-Jews,” Parmet said. “This is the very definition of apartheid.”</p>\n<p>Parmet also said a stark socioeconomic and military contrast has been struck between Israel and Palestine that needs to be acknowledged.</p>\n<p>“Israel has one of the strongest militaries in the world — the only nuclear arsenal in the Middle East and the unconditional backing of the world’s sole superpower,” Parmet said. “Meanwhile, the Palestinians across the table remain stateless, impoverished, occupied or second-class citizens inside Israel.”</p>\n<p>However, Rabbi Evan Goodman of Hillel Santa Barbara said he opposed divestment on the grounds that it would not promote communication or facilitate peace.</p>\n<p>“Will it bring peace this much closer for Israelis and Palestinians? No, it will not,” Goodman said. “Will it make our campus this much more of a place where people can get along, engage in dialogue and have a civil climate? No, this one-sided resolution will not.”</p>\n<p>Division over the resolution took on a physical element as advocates and opponents of divestment concentrated on opposite sides of the room, in apparent solidarity with their respective camps. Andrew Farcast introduced himself as an Israeli Jew and described his family’s history being persecuted by the Nazis during the Holocaust, before calling on audience members to practice empathy when considering the resolution.</p>\n<p>“To my Israeli and Jewish brothers and sisters against this resolution: We cannot stand any longer for our money to fund home demolitions, bombings, theft of water, theft of land,” Farcast said. “Learning and being open to people’s suffering makes you much safer than any wall, any concrete, any required military service. But if you refuse to learn, you’re not actually making yourself or anyone safer.”</p>\n<p>Liran Braude, who grew up in South Africa under apartheid and served as a member of the Israeli Defense Forces for three years, said he found it insulting that the two unique political situations were compared with one another during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“While I find myself in the unique position of having grown up in apartheid South Africa and of having lived as an infantry soldier present in Israel, [the divestment bill] is an insult of the highest order — not only to Jews and Israelis, but mostly to the South Africans of color that actually suffered under apartheid,” Braude said.</p>\n<p>Kristian Bailey, a comparative studies in race &amp; ethnicity major from Stanford University, said the discussion brought up issues resurfaced due to the cyclical pattern of history and that student senators had an opportunity to participate in a push for social progress.</p>\n<p>“What you’re seeing before you is the cycle of history repeating itself — just in different issues,” Bailey said. “And you have the chance, as students, to participate in a movement for freedom, for justice, for liberation, and I urge you to look into it.”</p>\n<p>Although speakers on both sides delivered impassioned pleas throughout the evening, no major altercations broke out and Community Service Officers present did not need to intervene.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Divestment_JohnClow_04.23.2014_10.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1589963636\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"55012\"><img data-attachment-id=\"55025\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-25/a-s-votes-against-divestment-from-israel/divestment_johnclow_04-23-2014_10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Divestment_JohnClow_04.23.2014_10.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1398281615\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Divestment_JohnClow_04.23.2014_10\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Divestment_JohnClow_04.23.2014_10.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Divestment_JohnClow_04.23.2014_10.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-55025\" alt=\"Divestment_JohnClow_04.23.2014_10\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Divestment_JohnClow_04.23.2014_10.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Divestment_JohnClow_04.23.2014_10.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Divestment_JohnClow_04.23.2014_10.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Photo by John Clow / <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Will the Administration Step Up?</h2>\n<p>It’s been nearly six months since former Special Forces soldier and current UCSB biology student Paul Malone embarked on his most recent mission to improve and expand the limited services offered to veterans on campus. His plight has been an uphill battle.</p>\n<p>As president of the Student Veteran Organization, Malone assists veterans in their transition from soldier to student and addresses the various issues facing the student veteran community, which is armed with meager resources. While university administration has promised forthcoming improvements, Malone said he has seen a stark contrast between what has been promised and what has been delivered.</p>\n<p>The challenges facing veterans were worsened when Jon Parra, a 20-year veteran of the military and the director of the independently funded Veteran Resource Team, resigned at the end of March. Malone attempted to explain some of the causes behind Parra’s departure, which eliminated UCSB’s last full-time staff position devoted entirely to veterans.</p>\n<p>“He wasn’t finding himself effective here, and the infrastructure, I suppose, isn’t in place for him to do the things that need to be done for him to start and maintain a successful veterans program,” Malone said. “Now there is no one dedicated full-time to veterans as there used to be.”</p>\n<p>Frustration at UCSB’s climate for veterans is not an isolated phenomenon. Ph.D. student and naval veteran Delores Mondragon described her experiences at UCSB as “intolerable” and said she “faced assault and harassment for being a veteran.”</p>\n<p>Here at UCSB, Mondragon studies Military Sexual Trauma, a term that references experiences of sexual assault or harassment in the military, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder, a debilitating anxiety disorder that follows an experience or witness of a terrifying, traumatic or tragic event, as defined by the American Psychology Association. When she reported an incident of being attacked and threatened, however, her fellow students mocked her, implying that her report was merely indication that she suffered from the very disorder she studied. Even when she approached the Title IX office at UCSB, she did not receive much consolation.</p>\n<p>“It was hinted by fellow students that my reporting of harassment was a condition of me possibly suffering from PTSD. I reported the incident to Title IX and they could not do anything even though I was grabbed, cussed at and threatened with future retaliation,” Mondragon said. “But this was seen as an exaggeration, and when I reported it to the dean, I was ostracized because I took it outside of the department — I was told things get handled in-house.”</p>\n<p>Mondragon said she was only seeking the most basic level of courtesy and equal treatment for veterans.</p>\n<p>“We just want to be treated as human beings,” she said.</p>\n<p>This past week, the issue reached a critical point when Malone and another student veteran, Aaron Barruga, personally delivered a detailed and extensive list of grievances from the veteran community to the office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The letter described “cultural, administrative and resource failures that have hampered the integration and success of our student veterans,” and outlined specific action that the university should take to correct these failures.</p>\n<p>The recommended actions included implementing a digital tracking and record-keeping system for enrolled student veterans, hiring a new, full-time Coordinator of Veteran and Military Services and establishing mandatory veteran awareness training for faculty and staff, which is similar to training provided for awareness of other minority groups.</p>\n<p>The most urgent element of the letter regarded the appalling national rate of veteran suicide, which stands at about 22 people every day, according to the Department of Veteran Affairs. In other words, a veteran takes his or her own life every 65 minutes.</p>\n<p>Barruga, a former member of the military’s elite Joint Special Operations Command and current first-year economics major, explained the potentially deadly risks that are associated with not providing proper resources to “an entire demographic of students who are predisposed to testing positive” for PTSD.</p>\n<p>“It’s such a pertinent issue because, if we were a Filipino culture club or whatever, the end state may be limited to, say, [the fact that] people would not appreciate our culture the way we wanted them to,” Barruga said. “Our end state is [that] a veteran is not going to feel socially accepted because he has PTSD. The culture here is going to unconsciously create distress for him and he’s going to go home and blow his fucking brains out. So our end state is very costly if we choose not to act.”</p>\n<p>Clinical psychologist Kirsten Olson said it is essential for the university to provide additional services to student veterans, who she said are considered “non-traditional students” for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>“They are older, they are more likely to have families and they are more likely to have other sorts of problems that our traditional college students don’t have,” Olson said. “They are also more likely to have lots of strengths and life experience that other traditional students don’t have.”</p>\n<p>Olson, who specializes in addressing PTSD issues in combat veterans, expressed support for Malone’s continued efforts for improvement, saying “there’s always more that can be done.”</p>\n<p>“I think that’s why Paul’s leadership has been so great, because he’s acknowledging, ‘Right, UCSB has done a lot, but there’s more to be done,’” Olson said. “He’s trying to raise that awareness — that these are the next steps that need to be done.”</p>\n<p>Malone, members of the administration and the Veteran Resource Team have been working relentlessly to relocate the Veteran Resource Center from its current 10-foot-by-10-foot room to a larger area, specifically Building 434, a structure located near Counseling Services that has remained vacant for over six months for unspecified maintenance reasons. Their efforts finally paid off yesterday, with the university informing veterans that the building would be allocated to them. The new space is, according to Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead, more than twice the size of the current VRC, and could prove more accommodating to the population of more than 100 veterans and 350 veteran dependents on campus that it caters to.</p>\n<p>A key concern raised by the letter was the amount of student veterans that have dropped out of UCSB since last year, which the letter stated was a quarter of the total student veteran population. In light of this number, the letter also stated that not enough efforts have been made to service student veterans.</p>\n<p>“We have failed to educate, protect, and empower student veterans, as a university,” the letter stated.</p>\n<p>With such high drop-out rates, Malone said there is a lack of concern for retaining student vets, which he said would not be such an issue for many other underrepresented students.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of communities where it would be simply unacceptable to lose a quarter of the population — that’s huge,” Malone said.</p>\n<p>Armistead disputed the accuracy of the statistic by referring to veterans who delivered “statements of intent to register, but then did not enroll.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that there was a misunderstanding on the numbers that the students were working with,” she said.</p>\n<p>Even with her disagreement on the figures, Armistead said UCSB still needs to provide more to veterans on campus.</p>\n<p>“I do believe that we need to do a better job supporting veteran students,” she said. “The goal is to hire a coordinator that focuses on supporting veterans. I believe this focus will help with improving retention.”</p>\n<p>Several instances of potentially offensive and thoughtless language from university faculty was the final grievance expressed in the letter to the chancellor. In one instance mentioned in the letter, a tenured professor said of concerns surrounding student veterans and efforts to assist them, “What’s the worst that could happen? Suicide?”</p>\n<p>The remark was made in the presence of a student vet, and Olson said such a statement runs contrary to the accepting and welcoming environment the university is supposed to hold for all students.</p>\n<p>“We talk about having a climate of respect on campus and appreciating diversity, having respect for all different points of view,” she said. “But, making derogatory comments or dismissive comments about suicide — that wouldn’t be okay to say … in the Greek community in terms of fraternities or sororities. So why would it be okay to make dismissive comments about the veteran community?”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the prevalence of suicide in the vet community is as concerning for vets, and should be treated as delicately, as it would be for any other student community, Olson said.</p>\n<p>“You wouldn’t say ‘Who cares?’ if a queer person kills themselves, so why is it okay to say ‘Who cares?’ if a veteran kills themselves? It wouldn’t be okay to say that about any of our valued community members.”</p>\n<p>Like Olson, Barruga said he found the comments unproductive and careless.</p>\n<p>“When you start saying stuff that paints this picture that veterans are damaged goods — they come from lower class, they’re uneducated, just shit like that — it doesn’t help,” Barruga said.</p>\n<p>Despite the long list of grievances, Olson provided insight regarding the progress that UCSB administrators have made toward veterans’ issues in the recent past. For example, Olson said Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young has demonstrated consistent support for student veterans. Similarly, Executive Assistant to Chancellor Yang Diane O’Brien said members of the administration have, in fact, been working diligently to improve the state of affairs for veterans.</p>\n<p>“I’m not trying to make any excuses. We’ve been working really hard with Student Affairs to help solve some of their issues,” O’Brien said.</p>\n<p>Whether administration officials are indeed striving to improve the state of veteran affairs on campus or are engaged in conscious or unconscious negligence, a significant portion of the veteran segment in the student population continues to face a unique set of challenges. Speaking with many of them, it becomes apparent that some are dissatisfied with their treatment and experiences at UCSB. Still, according to Mondragon, they remain “skilled, responsible and prepared,” with a determination to work for a more equal system on behalf of their fellow veterans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-54777-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/Veteran.jpg?fit=520%2C300\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54804\",\"title\":\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0079-e1397118822601.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54782\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0109.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54783\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0144-e1397118837242.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54784\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0176-e1397118853627.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54785\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0240-e1397118874744.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54786\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMGP0553-e1397118980749.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54787\",\"title\":\"IMGP0553\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/Picture-005-e1397118999361.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54788\",\"title\":\"Picture 005\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/Picture-135-e1397119012143.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54789\",\"title\":\"Picture 135\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/SANY0320-e1397119026534.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54790\",\"title\":\"SANYO DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p>Photos Courtesy of Paul Malone</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, April 10 edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Other items discussed at the meeting included the resolution to provide trigger warnings in classrooms to trauma victims that has garnered significant media attention, continuing improvements to the Isla Vista Pardall Center, plans for a professional drag show sponsored by the Queer Commission and confirmation that The Fire Department will be playing at Chilla Vista.</p>\n<p>Moore attempted to clarify police objectives regarding shutting down parties during Deltopia weekend in response to Senator Montana MacLachlan’s question asking what constitutes a “large party” in police terms. He said police personnel are not necessarily focusing on private house parties, but rather are concerned about large-scale, open-house gatherings or on-street crowding of over 500 people that can easily spin out of control.</p>\n<p>“They’re worried about the stuff that spills into the street or is totally public where there is no monitoring of who is coming in,” Moore said. “Those parties that you can just walk into — that’s what they’re trying to aim at, they’re basically trying to shut down stuff like that that’s uncontrolled.”</p>\n<p>Moore also said he advises party hosts to keep their music at relatively low levels to avoid receiving a citation for a noise ordinance violation. Unfortunately, according to Moore, there has been no stated decibel measurement of what constitutes as “low level” noise, so Moore suggests music players adhere to the rules from Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“I would stick to Halloween standards really, to be honest, as a precaution,” Moore said. “They make a judgment call when they decide to give you a ticket like that, so they’re not really able to tell us, which kind of sucks.”</p>\n<p>Moore then addressed concerns over newly-installed cameras in I.V. According to Moore, funds for the cameras were allocated by the university.</p>\n<p>“The security cameras are being paid for and provided by on the request of the university administration,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Senators continued to press for further information about the new surveillance measures. The lack of knowledge revealed that none of A.S. leadership was provided basic details of the new security measures that would be using school resources, such as who would operate and monitor the cameras, their costs or the duration of their implementation.</p>\n<p>Moore said he does not approve of the degree of secrecy with which the new surveillance measures were executed.</p>\n<p>“I think the way they put up the security should be more transparent,” Moore said. “There’s been no P.R. or attempt to explain what was going on… [and] all these things that are supposed to be part of a community discussion just didn’t exist.”</p>\n<p>Senators debated the legitimacy as well as the pros and cons of the new security cameras, with Off-Campus Letters &amp; Arts Collegiate Senator Scott O’Halloran expressing approval of the cameras. O’Halloran cited recent incidents of assault and said the cameras could be a useful tool to track down suspects.</p>\n<p>“Instead of being uncomfortable with people watching you all the time, be like, ‘I’m uncomfortable because I just got assaulted and there is no justice for me,’” O’Halloran said. “It’s a serious thing. Maybe we should be less concerned with our privacy and more about somebody getting justice.”</p>\n<p>Collegiate Senator for the College of Engineering Amir Khazaieli delivered a rebuttal to pro-surveillance advocates, as he cited numerous studies of other surveillance systems, highlighting a controversial one in England. According to Khazaieli, the system in England showed that there was “no evidence that mass surveillance had reduced overall crime rates” and there was also “evidence of clear abuse” from police units to target minorities.</p>\n<p>“This is considered mass surveillance,” Khazaieli said. “Some of the other places that have implemented stuff like this include the U.K., Iran, Russia, Vietnam, East Germany and Bahrain. … Places that have implemented video surveillance have shown and proven that it’s actually not effective.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieili also said he stresses the importance of protecting I.V. citizens’ constitutional rights on individual privacy.</p>\n<p>“I think there needs to be a lot of definite rules and regulations set forth with this so that it doesn’t conflict with anybody’s Fourth Amendment rights,” Khazaieli said. “I think we should definitely take action on this.”</p>\n<p>After the discussion surrounding police security measures, Senate moved onto other topics, which included the restructuring of A.S. The restructure plan has been in the works for several months and faced several revisions, culminating in its passing on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Nearly 20 bills connected to the restructure were passed, creating major changes in the way the executive office operates. Such changes include eliminating certain positions of the president’s staff, consolidating others and reforming legislative boards and commissions. One restructuring bill authored by A.S. President Jonathan Abboud removed the powers of the A.S. president to select the editorial staff of <i>The Bottom Line</i> (<i>TBL</i>) newspaper.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the changes to <i>The Bottom Line</i> would make the paper more autonomous.</p>\n<p>“<i>The Bottom Line</i> will be moved under the press council, like the [Daily] Nexus is,” Abboud said. “They’ll still be something that A.S. funds through a lock-in [fee], but it won’t be something [to which] I could say, ‘Well, I don’t want this editor to be the <i>TBL</i> editor’ and not appoint them. That takes away that power of the president to manage the press. That was important for me to take out.”</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, senators passed a resolution authored by Off-Campus Senator Beatrice Contreras establishing a committee to reevaluate the Isla Vista Master Plan in an effort to increase community influence on new building developments.</p>\n<p>It was also announced that students could bring their artwork to the A.S. Pardall Center to have it displayed publicly for one month free of charge, after which it would be returned to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54596\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54596\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/","id":3024,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3023,3022,3021],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet explained the unusual situation in an email.</p>\n<p>“Due to the fact that the agenda didn’t get sent out to the list servers on time, we are conducting a phone vote this week so we aren’t breaking the Brown Act,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>During Public Forum, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming presented to the Senate further details about the meningitis vaccine UCSB will offer in the Recreation Center for a two-week period starting this Monday. According to Flemming, acquiring the vaccine required the cooperation of around 150 administrators and other staff.</p>\n<p>“This is a pretty extraordinary effort that’s underway right now,” Fleming said. “There are probably about 150 people from campus working on this — probably about 30 of them working full time to make this happen.”</p>\n<p>Fleming addressed concerns regarding side effects of the vaccine, citing a recent case in which the vaccine was administered to a large number of people with no serious repercussions.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know about the countries, but Princeton is probably the best example recently. We understand that they gave close to six thousand and they didn’t have any significant adverse reactions, except for just a sore arm and a few students fainted,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>Later, A.S. President Jonathan Abboud informed the Senate on the expected cost of the meningitis vaccine and ways to mitigate its financial impact on any particular department.</p>\n<p>“The estimated cost of the meningitis vaccine for everybody is two million dollars,” Abboud said. “There’s no set place approved to pay for it yet … we want to spread the costs a little bit, because faculty get meningitis too, they are with us everyday.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also discussed a proposed Associated Students food cart in the University Center, saying it would benefit many students.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can actually have an A.S. run food service like most A.S.’s have, and we can give students experience running a business,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore gave a brief presentation in which he said he was working to get the architect of the new development planned for I.V. known as “The Nest” to speak at next weeks Senate meeting and answer questions from the public.</p>\n<p>“I know he said he wanted to speak to students about it, so I told him this would be a great opportunity to speak to a bunch of students,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Also during the meeting, the UCSB Investment Advisory Committee presented to the Senate its plans to reinvest a portion of its funding into the bank Barclay’s and 10-year Mexican treasury bonds as a response to projected higher interest rates in the near future.</p>\n<p>Other items discussed at the meeting included a new student literary arts magazine titled The Catalyst that will accept work from students of all majors and ages, A.S. funding for a planned Persian New Years event with authentic Persian food, a proposal to commission a mural at the I.V. Community Center at Pardall and the Battle of the Bands concert that will be held next Wednesday at the Hub at 6:30pm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54126\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54126\" data-attachment-id=\"54126\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-senate-discusses-new-vaccine-future-projects/as-senate-kenneth-song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1501%2C793&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1501,793\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1392843783\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"85\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate Kenneth Song\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=250%2C132&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=888%2C469&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-54126\" alt=\"Other items discussed at the meeting included a Persian New Years event and the upcoming Battle of the Bands. \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song-1024x540.jpg?resize=610%2C321\" width=\"610\" height=\"321\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-54126\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Other items discussed at the meeting included a Persian New Years event and the upcoming Battle of the Bands.</p></div>\n<p>Photo by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54125\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-senate-discusses-new-vaccine-future-projects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54125\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-senate-discusses-new-vaccine-future-projects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-senate-discusses-new-vaccine-future-projects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-senate-discusses-new-vaccine-future-projects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-senate-discusses-new-vaccine-future-projects/","id":3052,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3051,3050,3049],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Representatives from the Student Commission on Racial Equality and the Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs also gave presentations on ongoing projects, in addition to the discussion of other issues and projects, such as a Bone Thugs-n-Harmony concert that will be held at the Hub on Mar. 6.</p>\n<p>In regard to the marijuana legalization debate, Senators decided to revisit discussion on the bill near the end of the meeting after it had already been passed without deliberation. This discussion incited passionate exchanges on both sides of the issue, with Senators Andre Theus, Amir Khazhaeli, Nick Onyshko, and Montana MacLachlan voicing opposition to the bill. Khazaieli said he feared the bill would reflect badly on UCSB’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“As representatives of the entire student body, taking a stance like this is completely counteractive to the whole notion of promoting UCSB as not a party school, not an ‘OK, get high and not care about anything,’” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Taylor supported the bill, and referred to a position supported by Assemblymember Das Williams, and he argued that one potential benefit of legalization would be the reduction of violence and profits connected to transnational drug cartels.</p>\n<p>“If the taxation happens and we legalize it, that could be taking money out of drug cartels,” Taylor said. “If there is a legalization and it’s going towards a good cause, not only will it be going towards benefiting higher education, but it could be a pipeline to stopping certain drug cartel interactions.”</p>\n<p>At one point, it was revealed that the entire Senate body lacked some knowledge on the legal status of marijuana in the state, when Off-Campus Senator Nick Onyshko asked the question to all senators of whether marijuana was decriminalized in California and did not receive an accurate response until a fellow senator researched the issue.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus, who opposed the bill, said he was frustrated with his fellow senators’ conduct shortly after the confusion.</p>\n<p>“I am extremely, extremely … disappointed with my Senate tonight,” Theus said. “People in this room don’t even know what the current rates are for a misdemeanor or what the actual revenue’s going to bring in … I think we need to bring that back to the Senate, with all of us being educated on the issues of the agenda.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she agreed with Theus regarding the Senate’s actions, and added her own personal sentiment.</p>\n<p>“I’m pissed,” MacLachlan said. “I feel very personally offended.”</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, Student Commission on Racial Equality co-chair Hani Tajsar gave a presentation to the Senate regarding the Facing Race Conference that will be held at the SRB on Feb. 22nd. The event seeks to educate students on issues that affect students of color, and anyone who attends will receive a free S.C.O.R.E. t-shirt and free tacos.</p>\n<p>Tajsar also advocated student action that would continue and improve efforts to recruit and help undocumented and low-income students graduate at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The recruitment and retention rate for undocumented students and low-income students in general, is something that I’m ashamed of … and we should all push for a better system,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore gave a presentation on the controversial proposal for a new development in Isla Vista, which would be located at the current site of the bar Dublin’s at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar. The four-story building, called The Nest has received much criticism from students, according to Moore, which is why he plans to work against the project.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, I’m representing student opinions,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Other items discussed during the meeting included the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony concert to be held on Mar. 6, as well as updates from Erick Lankey about promoting food insecurity awareness through the A.S. Food Bank, a progress report on the petition being distributed by the UCen S.U.R.F. initiative and updates on a leadership conference hosted by the Office of Student Life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[<em>Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Senator Amir Khazaieli led the opposition, while in fact multiple senators opposed the bill. In addition, it was wrongly stated that Senator Montana MacLachlan disagreed with Senator Andre Theus when in fact she agreed with his frustration with the Senate. The article has been updated to incorporate these corrections.</em>]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54043\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54043\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/","id":3041,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3040,3039,3038],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Environmental concerns, particularly coastal conservation efforts, dominated her presentation, as Farr said biodiversity of the coastland contains great value.</p>\n<p>“Because of all the coastline that I have, all the coastal protection issues are of utmost importance,” Farr said. “This particular stretch of coastline has some of the highest biodiversity on the planet.”</p>\n<p>Farr said Santa Barbara County’s efforts to move away from fossil fuels toward renewable sources of energy has been a prominent effort that she and members of her office “all take very seriously.”</p>\n<p>“I feel very strongly, as do several of my colleagues, that moving our county and our society toward a more sustainable future, looking at our consumption of fossil fuels and how we transition to more sustainable energy sources is something that’s extremely important, and I think that Santa Barbara County has been a model in many ways of forward thinking on environmental issues,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>In addition, Farr said she is currently working to put together the I.V. community center, which she believes will be a vital addition to the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>“It’s not an easy fight, but we’ve come this far and we’re optimistic that it will happen,” Farr said. “Having a community center in I.V. is huge and this is something that’s been going on for a long time. I’d really like to see it happen.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Collegiate Senator Amir Khazaieli reported on the current progress in receiving funding for the I.V. Pardall space.</p>\n<p>“We do have money now to continue the improvement that y’all as an association and a student body have requested in the last quarter and a half,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Corey Lau, however, showed skepticism toward the community center, asking Senator Khazaieli to justify the expenditure.</p>\n<p>“I’m still apprehensive of the very existence of the Pardall Center, because as far as I know, I’m not so sure that’s a necessary thing,” Lau said. “I want to hear your argument as to why do we need the Pardall Center.”In response, Khazaieli said the center is designed to address various shortcomings within I.V., such as a lack in a connected sense of community.</p>\n<p>“There’s frankly no community and/ or student presence in I.V. right now, especially from the Association,” Khazaieli said. “Having something on Pardall Road … an area where everyone passes will one, incredibly increase[s] transparency and outreach of our association … and will allow us to reach more people with our events, our tabling, our forums — with everything that we do. So I think that it’s a very valid, very needed space.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud’s veto of a bill passed by the Senate regarding the implementation of a new logo for A.S. was upheld after a lengthy debate amongst the Senators, delaying any possibility of implementing changes to the existing logo.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed plans for the upcoming Chilla Vista concert, the expected budget of which totals to roughly $17,500. Senators spoke on the goal of putting primarily local bands into focus for the concert and noted that this year’s planned expenditure is lower than last year’s. The unspent funds were instead diverted toward the I.V. Pardall space.</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included plans to increase lighting on dark streets in I.V., the fumigation of the Thunderdome, hiring of a new A.S. administrative personnel, planned renovations to the UCen under the S.U.R.F. Initiative and the efforts to provide more worm compost bins around campus to reduce food waste.</p>\n<p>Later at the meeting, Lundberg was sworn as Senator to replace Senator Marvin Ramirez, who resigned for personal reasons.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53902\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53902\" data-attachment-id=\"53902\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/a-s-senate-discusses-energy-debates-i-v-center-logo/as_senate_johnclow_02-05-2014-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1391632970\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"160\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-53902\" alt=\"Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr attended last night’s A.S. meeting to present on current office projects regarding the student community.\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-53902\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr attended last night’s A.S. meeting to present on current office projects regarding the student community.</p></div>\n<p>Photo by John Clow / Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, February 6, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
