Food Bank.</p>\n<p>In explaining the California State Budget’s impact on the education system, third-year student Ajinkya Joshi discussed Governor Jerry Brown’s priorities in educational funding and also said tuition costs are expected to remain unchanged in the upcoming years.</p>\n<p>“He’s going to focus on making a five percent increase in the general fund to schools and higher education,” Joshi said. “Essentially, our tuition won’t be increasing; it will be stable, and the UCs and CSUs are going to be aiming to try to increase innovation and trying to make it so that way more of us graduate at a lower cost.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Joshi said the current problems in higher education are that the UCs have a higher cost structure and higher per student subsidy.</p>\n<p>“Right now the problem is trying to maintain the quality of education while keeping the costs low for the student,” Joshi said.</p>\n<p>Although Joshi’s presentation covered a fairly large quantity of information that would directly impact UCSB students, Senators came close to denying Joshi sufficient time to make the presentation. The vote on granting Joshi his requested 10 minutes of extra time turned out to be a tie until Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet broke it with a vote in favor of the time extension.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore spoke briefly on plans for Deltopia, the annual student-organized event coming up this Spring Quarter, regarding efforts to provide extra police units, Port-a-Potties and access to drinking water during the festivities. Moore said he will advocate for a similar system established during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“What I want to do is an expanded version of what we did for Halloween,” Moore said. “We’ll have a hydration station and some sort of safety effort as well.”</p>\n<p>Chair of A.S. Food Bank and third-year economics and accounting major Erick Lankey reported on a series of upcoming events geared toward enhancing student involvement and knowledge about the Food Bank. According to Lankey, these events include “how to eat on a low budget” tours through the I.V. Food Co-op, an extreme couponing team contest and a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program challenge in which participants pledge to live on $31.50 of food for a week in an effort to gain empathy for the challenges faced by individuals living on food stamps.</p>\n<p>The presentation received positive feedback from Off-Campus Senators Andre Taylor and Nick Onyshko. Taylor said he was “very excited” to participate, and Onyshko said he applauds the Food Bank for its growth as an organization.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to say all this stuff sounds amazing, and I’m really impressed with everything you’ve done with this committee,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>Bills passed during the meeting included a bill to update Take Back the Night’s legal code as well as another bill that limits the amount of money campus BCCs spend on food per quarter to $500 or less, depending on the size of the particular BCC, as part of an effort to reduce wasteful spending. A bill to establish a new A.S. logo was tabled for another week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/","id":3138,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3137,3136,3135],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Pardall Center, reported that progress has been made on installing utilities in the rented property.  Lyden said the Pardall Center has come a long way from its initial disrepair, but the building still needs work.</p>\n<p>“We realized that there was a lot that needed to be done … some outlets were wired incorrectly and some weren’t working at all, so we had our electrician come and look the place over and he did a lot of great work. Electrically, the Pardall Center is doing very well,” Jeannette said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Alex Choate outlined plans to host an event called “Weed Wednesday” during the upcoming “Week of Revenue,” in which miniature “purple haze” cupcakes will be handed out to promote legalization of marijuana as a source of funding for higher education.</p>\n<p>The meeting was briefly interrupted by a raffle in which nine free tickets to the upcoming A.S. Program Board-hosted Childish Gambino concert were given to Senators.</p>\n<p>Other items discussed at the meeting included possible headliners for the Chilla Vista concert later this quarter, a report on the national education budget proposal for 2014 and a bill to establish a new logo for Associated Students.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</h4>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53602\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/a-s-senate-calls-for-sexual-assault-policy-reform/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53602\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/a-s-senate-calls-for-sexual-assault-policy-reform/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/a-s-senate-calls-for-sexual-assault-policy-reform/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/a-s-senate-calls-for-sexual-assault-policy-reform/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/a-s-senate-calls-for-sexual-assault-policy-reform/","id":3124,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3123,3122,3121],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

In addition to the relief resolution, senators listened to a presentation on student debt, postponed taking a stance on a UC worker strike and supported changes to the California Master Plan for Higher Education.  </p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Nikki Calderon, who helped draft the resolution along with Off-campus Senator Beatrice Contreras, said there is a pressing need for more monetary allocations toward the relief fund, as she explained the nature of the catastrophe.</p>\n<p>“It’s estimated that there’s over 10,000 dead, and that’s just from the initial storm itself,” Calderon said. “This relief money is severely needed.”</p>\n<p>However, senators spent over an hour and a half feuding over the details of the bill, with some students not in favor of committing two hours of their week to help collect funds. In response, Contreras expressed exasperation with her peers.</p>\n<p>“I’m frustrated that this is taking so long,” Contreras said. “While we’re here debating this, there are literally people dying.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she felt it was unfair to other items on the agenda to spend such a disproportionate amount of time on the Typhoon resolution.</p>\n<p>“We spent over one hour on one resolution,” MacLachlan said. “And then the rest of the resolutions that were on the table, we only talked about for five or 10 minutes that were completely important … I think that we need to just remember that they all need their fair amount of distribution.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the resolution passed with a fundraising goal of $5,000, as proposed by On-campus Senator Colton Bentz.</p>\n<p>Amongst other items debated more briefly was a resolution in support of revising the current California Master Plan for Higher Education, which was first implemented in 1960. A.S. President Jonathan Abboud and External Vice President of Student Affairs Alex Choate advocated in favor of the revision at the meeting, pointing out the outdated goals of the current plan.  </p>\n<p>“I want to emphasize how important passing this resolution is,” Abboud said. “Please pass this, and if it’s passed, make a big deal about it.”</p>\n<p>Senators swiftly passed the resolution with little debate.</p>\n<p>Additionally at the meeting, Federal Policy Analyst Monte Richardson gave a short presentation on federal student loan debt, focusing on UCSB in particular.</p>\n<p>“In 2011, the average student load debt was $18,627 dollars, which is a little bit lower than the national average,” Richardson said. “The proportion of students with debt was 49 percent, which is a little bit less than half — just around the nation average.”</p>\n<p>A bill in support of UC workers on strike was tabled for a week due to a lack of data being provided, according to Off-campus Senator Nick Onyshko. Although senators are given a meeting agenda in advance so as to prepare accordingly, Onyshko said presenters should have provided more basic information to senators.</p>\n<p>“The lack of figures presented by the organizers was quite disconcerting,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>Several other resolutions were quickly passed with little to no debate, including a resolution requesting check-ins between UCPD and the A.S. Senate, a resolution funding a university housing forum and minor updates to the legal codes for Human Rights Board and Isla Vista Community Relations Committee.</p>\n<p>Other projects discussed at the meeting included new bike paths and racks and progress on the “Rate My Landlord” website, amongst others.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53024\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53024\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/a-s-senators-pass-typhoon-fundraiser-rush-rest-of-meeting/","id":3065,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3064,3063,3062],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

In addition, the executive officers delivered reports updating the Senate on news from their offices.</p>\n<p>External Vice President for Local Affairs Alex Moore briefly recapped Halloween, saying this year’s festivities were milder than anticipated.</p>\n<p>“It was overall a smaller Halloween than we thought,” Moore said. “For a Thursday night Halloween, it was really kind of controlled.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud addressed the Senate regarding his recent meeting with the campus planning committee, expressing frustration at the resistance he encountered towards his plans for a UCen renovation.</p>\n<p>“Our project is $25 million and there were other projects that are $150 million and our project was the only one that was questioned and criticized,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>He said the university is in “critical” need of “a student services building that provides much-needed resources,” saying there should be more support for such a facility, in light of the campus funding a $150 million engineering building.</p>\n<p>Associated Student Food Bank advisors Tuyen Nguyen and Erick Lankey reported to the Senate on the expanding operations of the organization. Nguyen said the food bank is going to move beyond non-perishable goods to include more fresh produce.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to make sure students have access to healthier foods, which is what we’re working on.” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>Some of the bills that passed included one to provide $3,000 in funding for the UCSB men’s club soccer team to travel to the National Tournament in Phoenix, Arizona, in addition to a motion to provide $3,000 in funding for the Pi Beta Phi Foundation lip-sync contest that will be held in Campbell Hall, raising money to provide books to underprivileged children.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she supported the event on the grounds of the number of students expected to attend.</p>\n<p>“There’s more than 850 students that attend this event and that’s a pretty significant portion of the student body,” MacLachlan said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also passed a resolution to organize fundraising for an endowment that would grant a scholarship to undocumented students, introduced by Senator Marvin Ramirez. Senators also established a group project to create a landlord rating website to protect students from unfair property owners and managers. The project intends to work with multiple on campus organizations and groups.</p>\n<p>Finally, plans were discussed to establish an A.S. YouTube channel that would allow for live streaming of student senate meetings to make the proceedings more accessible to the general student body. The live streaming meetings are part of an effort to increase A.S. Senate transparency and they come in light of one student addressing the governmental body’s alleged failure to connect with students. Jimmy Villarreal said that he appreciated the criticism, saying “I want to thank you for coming in and holding us accountable.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1516561681\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"52880\"><img data-attachment-id=\"52882\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/a-s-senate-discusses-campus-climate-abboud-proposes-ucen-renovation/as-senate_11-06-2013_kenneth-song-8940/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1383773729\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"85\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth song-8940\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-52882\" alt=\"AS Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth song-8940\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AS-Senate_11.06.2013_kenneth-song-8940.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore spoke about safety preparations for Isla Vista’s notoriously massive Halloween festivities. Moore reported the idea of temporary fencing he hoped to install along the cliffs of Del Playa Drive to prevent cliff fall injuries or deaths was shut down due to funding issues as well as liability concerns, from the University’s Office of Risk Management.</p>\n<p>Moore said he was frustrated with the decision but is determined to continue working on the issue, as he remains confident in achieving future success.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to be moving forward to negotiate with the county on some sort of framework or method, so that this doesn’t happen again [and] so that we can always have temporary fencing during high-risk events,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>He also mentioned the Festival ordinance that will be in effect from this Saturday until Nov. 4, saying he and other groups are working to make students aware of the ordinance and other changes. “We’re doing everything we can to make sure folks don’t get an unnecessary ticket,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Moore said hydration stations and portable bathrooms will be set up for each night of Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, executive officers and public forum speakers delivered reports on their recent accomplishments and upcoming activities.</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud discussed his recent meeting with new U.C. President Napolitano in Oakland on Monday during his report, in which he expressed positive results that included promises from her to meet with the elected members of campus governments in person once a quarter and to speak to them on the phone once per month.</p>\n<p>In addition, Abboud said he was pleased with their success in getting Napolitano to address the skyrocketing cost of tuition.</p>\n<p>“She did well, in terms of answering what we wanted but we did corner her on a couple of things we wanted … like Prop 13,” Abboud said. “So we got her to admit that Prop 13 is one of the reasons tuition has gotten so high.”</p>\n<p>Along with the passing of a few minor bills, the meeting tabled a bill sending directives to Napolitano. Towards the end of the meeting, Senators debated the bill, concluding they would clarify the language and demands of the drafted proposal and vote on it next week.</p>\n<p>One section of the bill prohibits the use of U.C. funds to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to Senator Nikki Calderon, currently no U.C. funds go toward assisting ICE, but the bill ensures that these funds will not be used in the future. This section Calderon said, serves to secure that the funding “may not be happening, but it will not happen also.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included a tree-planting event Saturday at Goleta Valley Beautiful, planned homeless assistance in I.V. provided by Pescadero Lofts and efforts to make the dining commons Kosher-friendly. For next week’s meeting, Senate members will come dressed in their Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This story is a </em>Daily Nexus<em> online exclusive.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52629\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52629\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/","id":3062,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3061,3060,3059],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/164"}},"__N_SSG":true}
