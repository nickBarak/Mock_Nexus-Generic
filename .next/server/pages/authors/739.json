Its cavernous interior is modeled to look like a night time Spanish village, which certainly lends the place a lot of atmosphere. The rest of the theatre is clean, ornate and best of all, isn’t more expensive than any other movie theater.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Not exactly the place to watch a serious drama in. I saw “Spotlight” here, and the theatre echoed from the booming speakers and lack of audience. Definitely only come here for a blockbuster. “Ready Player One” definitely suited the place a lot better.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Buchanan Hall</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: You can go right outside to get dinner from the snack shack.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Everything else. Film students and professors alike </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loathe </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buchanan Hall. If the picture doesn’t fail, the sound does. The temperature always seems to be off. You need to slump in your seat to see the undersized, dirty screens. Seeing the original cut of “Star Wars”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in that place was truly painful. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Camino Real Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The proximity. It’s one bus ride away, and a short walk if you live around FT. The tickets are $7 on Tuesdays and there are some arcade games if you feel so inclined. The interior is very welcoming and if you need to eat afterwards, there’s a bunch of restaurants outside you can fill your belly at. I recommend the Kahuna Burger joint, if you’re feeling particularly referential.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The clientele. Generally, I’ve found that the more convenient a theater is to get to, the ruder the audience is. I had to ask a chattering couple sitting right behind me during “Infinity War” to be quiet. The boyfriend promptly told me to suck his dick and the girlfriend kept going “Sheeit!” in what sounded like a heavy Russian accent every time something happened for the next two hours.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Plaza del Oro Twin</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you’re looking for a film in limited release in Goleta, like “Brooklyn” (the only movie I ever saw there), this charming little twin theater is the place for you. It’s also right by a cafe if you’re feeling tired or hungry.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: No car? Expect to take the 11 and have to walk.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Goleta Drive-In</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The traditional passion pit experience: screenings in the dead of night in the privacy of your own car, complete with hot dogs. They even have old-as-dirt arcade games at the snack shack—the kinds you saw during commercial for Chuck-E-Cheese’s when you were in elementary school.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Leaving your car running to use the radio to hear the movie runs the risk of killing your battery.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Pollock Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: You can go see movies on the cheap that might not even be out in theaters yet, and see their cast and crew talk about them! One treasured memory of mine is seeing Steven Spielberg’s “1941” and hear one of the writers diss it. The audience is generally comprised of film students and old people, so it’s usually pretty quiet.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Food is restricted to the lobby.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Riviera Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: I have two words for you: Dolby Atmos. Candy for the ears, ambrosia for your temporal lobes. When I went to see “Blade Runner: 2049” here, the audience was told how an audio engineer who had seen the movie 37 times said that the sonic experience at the Riviera was the best he had had yet. And how. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The theater also prides itself on showing movies that fall well outside the mainstream, such as “The King’s Choice” and Cannes darling “The Square.” So if you want to see a film that will redefine how you listen to movies, this is the place to go.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Unless you have a car, this theater is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> out-of-the-way. It’s a 20 minute hike from State Street (which is pretty much how I got most of my exercise for Fall Quarter), and even though it has this amazing sound system, don’t expect to see it paired with many blockbusters, if any. Even the Atmos can be a crux — watching “Mother!” with it was the most viscerally unpleasant experience I’ve had at the movies. Also, the snacks are few and abhorrently expensive.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>I.V. Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There are two programs here: Free Tuesday films and Magic Lantern. The former is just how it sounds and Magic Lantern provides $4 movies on Mondays and Fridays. Occasionally, you may even catch a marathon of “Harry Potter” and “The Lord of the Rings.” Sneaking in outside food and beverages is encouraged and you can occasionally win a poster from trivia competitions. Also, if you’re a film buff, you can always talk to DJ Palladino and his students in the lobby.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If students aren’t talking behind you, they’re checking their text messages or Snapchatting scenes from the movie in front of you. On rare occasion, drunk homeless men wander in and start shouting at the screen and dropping bottles all over the place, although security will quickly remove them. The men’s bathroom is gnarly and the urinal laughs at anyone below six feet. Only one of the water fountains work.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, that’s it. That’s my guide. But before I go, let me leave off with some other general movie advice. Or rather, a plea. Because this stuff bugs me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t sneak snacks and drinks into the theater. Movie theaters get most of their money from concessions, since movie studios take most of the ticket sales. Don’t leave your trash around for the staff to pick up. Don’t send Instagrams or Snapchats or whatnot of whatever movie you’re watching and shine your phone’s light at the person sitting behind you. And for the love of god, stop exclaiming, “Oh shit!” every time something happens that surprises you. You’re in a public theater, not your living room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, I’m clocking out. Bye now.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-83436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Seth Trujillo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>I joined the <em>Daily Nexus</em> in October 2014. After turning my first assignment in late and still being hired for some reason, the first thing I did was go up to my then-editor, Audrey Bachelder, and ask her for dibs on reviewing “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” Go ahead, she said. I did it twice: one fake review for April Fools — thus technically making me the first person on the planet to write a review for “The Force Awakens” — and a real one that nobody read because they were too busy watching the actual thing.</p>\n<p>I spent a year and two months in fervent anticipation of seeing that movie and getting to write my review of it, hot off the heels of a one-year-stint as the Entertainment Editor of the <em>Pony Express </em>at Pioneer High School in San Jose.</p>\n<p>“But Alex,” you might say, “I don’t give a flying fuck about your nostalgic pre-graduation reminiscing. Is the movie any good or not?”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And, faithful reader with the colorful sentence-enhancers, I would say no sir. No, it is not. It looks good. It sounds good. It’s not a train wreck by any means.</p>\n<p>The thing is, these kinds of train wrecks are actually fun to watch.</p>\n<p>I am actually surprised by how much I didn’t care about what was going in “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” With prequel movies — especially those bearing the burden of the “Star Wars” brand — that’s to be expected, especially when you know where certain characters are going to end up at some point. But even with the new characters, played by actors of great repute like Emilia Clarke and Woody Harrelson, I was disappointed by how this movie spectacularly failed in making me care about them.</p>\n<p>In case you’re one of the unfortunate plentitude who had no idea this was even out, “Solo” is how Han got his start in the criminal underworld, although it’s not quite as focused on revealing how he became the roguish Harrison Ford-figure than it is on showing us how he got his gear. Alden Ehrenreich plays Han with enough charm to keep me from falling asleep. Same goes for rest of the cast — yes, even Donald Glover. They all do well enough to get by without leaving that much of an impression.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the only standout character I found myself getting invested in was L3, Lando’s co-pilot and further proof that Lucasfilm is better at creating more captivating droid characters than human ones. She’s a first in the new Star Wars canon, a droid who aspires to see her kind self-actualize and stop serving the whims of organic beings. That idea could carry a whole movie by itself, but here it’s little more than a character quirk that serves to the benefit of someone else’s story.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it’s a story that I could not give less of a crap about if I tried. Writers Kasdan and Kasdan take events already explained in the old canon — like Han’s time in the Imperial army, his meeting Chewbacca, the Kessel Run, obtaining the Millenium Falcon — and compress it all into a heist film about nabbing valuable fuel. The major problem here is that since this is yet another prequel, we know where Han, Chewie and Lando end up, so not only are there pretty much no stakes to be had, it’s also very difficult to get invested in their development.</p>\n<p>But there’s hardly any of that, either. For a long time via interviews, I’ve heard about how this movie explains how Han Solo became such a cynical smuggler, but we don’t see that. Instead, we’re treated to a movie that essentially serves as a shopping list: blaster? Check. Falcon? Check. Dice that were apparently in ”A New Hope” and were important for some reason in ”The Last Jedi?” Checkmate.</p>\n<p>There aren’t any decent villains for Han to play off of, either. Dryden Vos (played by Paul Bettany, Vision from the “Avengers” movies) looks cool, but he’s barely around. Enfys Nest — no, there’s no apostrophe in there — looks cool, sounds cool, fights like a badass, and then all that mystique and danger that surrounds the character evaporates in a second when the film reveals that they’re actually supposed to be a good guy. Dammit, “Solo!” Quit disappointing me!</p>\n<p>And then comes the part that baffles me. The film’s best scene, which doesn’t happen until after the climax and was the only part that got me genuinely excited, will probably confuse you unless you’ve watched “Clone Wars” or “Rebels<em>.</em>” As much as I appreciate the fan-service/sequel-bait, what’s the karking point if every entertainment outlet on the Internet has to write articles explaining it to the general moviegoer?</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’ve seen worse. And as per usual, I’m probably making it sound a lot worse than it probably is. But at the end of the day, outside of two fun scenes, abhorrent pacing, dull new characters and just-serviceable old ones and a distinct lack of anything new or fun bog “Solo” down and send it plummeting into a black hole of mediocrity to join the likes of Episodes I-III.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung’s still going to see the rest of them, though.</em></p><div

is that it avoids being crushed under the gargantuan weight of its own canon — seriously, just imagine the production costs of the last eighteen movies weighed in gold bullion. You have ten years’ worth of movie characters stuffed into two and a half hours, and somehow it managed not to suck!</p>\n<p>This movie’s storyline has been building up in bits and pieces since the 2012 Avengers film, but we’ve all gotten the gist by now: Thanos wants to collect a bunch of super-powered rocks that will give him ultimate power, and the Avengers, with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy, gotta stop him. But after two “Avengers” movies and “Civil War,” the novelty of huge crossover movies has worn itself out, and not being awful shouldn’t be one of this movie’s main points of praise.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So why does it feel like it is? I think it’s because there’s very little “Infinity War” does exceptionally well at. We’ve seen witty banter among a big cast of characters already. We’ve seen giant, sprawling battles of people fighting various CGI abominations. We’ve seen fights between fan-favorite characters. In a vague sense, we’ve seen “Infinity War” before, and it doesn’t do anything particularly special to make itself stand out against its predecessors.</p>\n<p>But it’s not bad. Nope, not at all. It’s fun and funny. It’s a good time. Stuff goes boom, characters crack jokes. Yes, it’s fun to see the Avengers interact with the Guardians of the Galaxy, which at least adds a new dynamic of crossover that we haven’t seen since the first “Avengers.”</p>\n<p>Narrative-wise, I also feel like “Infinity War” <em>is</em> a major step up from “Age of Ultron<em>.</em>” Which is sort of like saying that a bottled cabernet is a step up from bagged wine, but at least this movie at least concludes Thanos’s overall arc that Joss Whedon kicked off back in 2012 and saw fit to remind us of three years later in an otherwise mediocre movie.</p>\n<p>And while I’m on the topic of the latest motion-capture baddie, let me address him. Thanos (Josh Brolin) is another notable Marvel villain improvement, a fantastical realization of badditude right off the heels of the more grounded Killmonger. I wouldn’t say Brolin’s character has a fully fleshed-out personality, but he does at least have more than two emotions and complicated motivations. I don’t remember where, but I read somewhere once that the best villains are the one with sympathetic goals.</p>\n<p>Thanos’s objective is not at all good, but not wholly unsympathetic, either. He wants to use the Infinity Stones to wipe out half the universe to combat overpopulation. He truly believes himself to be working for the greater good, and since his methods have yielded positive results (at least, so he claims), it is impossible to dismiss his tactics completely. Although I question whether or not Thanos has considered creating more food and/or planets to better solve the problem. You have power over all space and time — there have to be more humane options you can conjure than vaporizing half of everything.</p>\n<p>Thinking about it, Thanos may just be the major point of praise that this film is deserving of. Now that he is finally taking an active role in the plot instead of sitting behind the scenes like a buff bogeyman, he gets to show off just what makes him the most-feared bad guy in the galaxy and why Loki shivers at the thought of him.</p>\n<p>One complaint I’ve seen circulating around the Internet that amuses me is the notion that this film will be impossible for those who have not seen the prior films. Well, yes. That’s sort of the point of a sequel and/or crossover. Being upset about that is like complaining that “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” did not go out of its way to explain who Harry, Ron and Hermione are and what they’re doing. If you don’t know what’s going on, watch the other movies. It’s certainly not as troublesome as loudly asking the kid sitting next to you who every character in the movie is. I’m looking at you, girl and her dad/uncle/grandpa/nondescript older male relation sitting two seats down from me at the theater.</p>\n<p>If I do have any genuine complaints, it’s the ending. The last two minutes before the credits roll just feel…weightless. But it’s not necessarily the movie’s fault; rather, it’s the fact that I can’t go anywhere on the Internet without seeing the casting info for “Avengers 4.” If I know who’s coming back for the next one, that pretty much kills any tension this movie’s trying to set up.</p>\n<p>But, y’know what? So what. That’s just a quibble. If you want to have fun for two and a half hours, this is what you want to see. I’m not particularly sentimental about the MCU — at least, not as much as that person I saw on Twitter who fainted after seeing the movie — but I know damn good popcorn entertainment when I see it. The film critic in me is disappointed that I wasn’t wowed, but the average filmgoer part enjoyed himself. “Infinity War” is a movie that shouldn’t have worked, but it did, and it’s fun.</p>\n<p>Good enough, I say. Just not great.</p>\n<p><em>We’re not sure if Wehrung has impossibly high standards or if he’s just a sourpuss.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready Player One </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twilight </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for boys. It certainly seems like a fair comparison, in terms of the broad strokes: they’re both wish-fulfillment stories featuring Mary Sue protagonists falling into unintentionally disturbing romances. Ernest Cline’s debut novel has been derided not only for this, but its masturbatory self-references — one infamous passage circulating around the web highlights a scene in which central character Wade Watts meticulously, uselessly lists off all the 80s-relevant accessories he’s added to his virtual DeLorean. (“’See? It’s an awful book!” the Internet cries.)  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s morbidly amusing to consider that Steven Spielberg directed an adaptation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twilight </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for boys</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then I read how his wife Kate Capshaw convinced him to do it after listening to the audiobook, which reminded me that despite its flaws, the book still speaks on some level to the people who lived through the time period that the book and its subsequent film heavily pull from: the 80s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that aspect of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready Player One </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is significantly toned down in the film in favor of emphasizing video games. Although big 80s musical hits are peppered throughout the soundtrack, the film is less about celebrating neon and big hair than about cramming as many video game characters on-screen as possible. Look! It’s Sonic! And Tracer! And…the Arkham Knight? Seriously? Who the hell’s going to be cosplaying as that overhyped disappointment in 2045?</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get distracted by these constant references, though. If you’re looking for a certain character you love to show up, you’ll be scanning the screen incessantly and completely miss the plot. Besides, if you’re hoping for the camera to linger for more than five seconds on a recognizable figure from pop-culture that’s not a giant robot, guess what? Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right, now that that’s out of the way, time to address the story and characters. As Wade explains over more exposition than ought to be acceptable, it’s the future. And the future sucks. To escape said suckage, people escape into a massive online virtual reality called the Oasis, created by the awkward James Halliday (played by recent Spielberg collaborator Mark Rylance). When Halliday dies, a posthumously-released video reveals that he’s hidden three keys inside the Oasis, and whoever finds them all and the Easter egg they unlock will inherit half a trillion in stock and get to control the Oasis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, everyone wants it: Wade, his best friend Aech (whose avatar is a hulking troll-like figure who has pylons and springs for intestines), resistance leader Art3mis and samurai partners Daito and Sho. They reunite in order to stop Electronic Ahem, I mean, Innovative Online Industries (IOI) from getting the egg first so they can bombard players with ads and micro-transactions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The characters as a whole get a noticeable upgrade from the book, to some degree. In the original book, Wade stalks Art3mis in a manner that’s supposed to be endearing, but is anything but. As a trade-off, we get a decidedly less creepy romance between the two… one that develops across a couple days. It’s stupid in Disney movies and it’s still stupid if Spielberg does it. As a result, Art3mis’ insistence that their online relationship isn’t genuine because they’ve never met — the only thing this story has going for it in terms of thematic relevance — seems a lot more like she’s trying to hide the fact that she’s got a port-wine stain on her face instead of a genuine critique of VR’s pitfalls. Well, poo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can’t say much about Aech without spoiling a decent chunk of the plot, but I’m happy to see said character’s identity and background isn’t used to deliver the same hilariously awkward and forced commentary as the book. It’s also nice to see Daito and Sho get some increased importance, even though we come away knowing next to nothing about them and instead wondering how the hell it’s possible that all these pivotal characters seem to be living in Columbus, Ohio without ever meeting each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, and there’s the villains. Ben Mendelsohn’s fine. He’s a corporate dick, and he’s good at it. Although I can’t help but laugh at his main henchwoman, just because of her name: F’nale Zandor. And that’s her </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">name; we never see her in the Oasis. It’s like screenwriters Penn and Cline came up with a fantasy name on the spot and said to themselves, “That’s good, sounds scary!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All right, I’m going on a tangent here. What works? Well, the Oasis looks awesome. Everything looks real, but not </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real. It’s a borderline uncanny valley, which works for the film’s video-game setting. The beginning chase sequence involving the likes of the DeLorean, King Kong and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jurassic Park </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">T-rex is a masterwork of speed and destruction. The final battle is a lot of fun, although too short. As cool as it is to see giant robots fighting each other, for the love of God, if you’re going to show us the battle to save… the world? Don’t end it after 10 minutes and go on for another 20 after that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a feeling that, in the future, I will watch three sequences of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready Player One </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on YouTube: the initial race, the horror movie tribute scene and the final battle. Because all those parts are insanely fun, and everything else is as expendable as toenail clippings. Which really stinks, because there could have been a great story here, instead of boy-meets-girl blah. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung is very upset over the lack of </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloodborne </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">references.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/","id":6141,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6140,6139,6138],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Spring Slate of Films","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lando-Featured-020718.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lando-Featured-020718.jpg?resize=970%2C545&ssl=1","description":"Ah, spring.

No? Too bad, they made a movie out of it. Much has been made of how Phil Lord and Chris Miller (masterminds behind “The Lego Movie”) had to be fired because they were deviating too far from the tone of Lawrence and Jon Kasdan’s script, necessitating their replacement with Ron Howard. I am torn with this film: Despite its production issues, I hope that it will be good, considering that Kasdan is writing it and it seems like it will deal more with the criminal underworld of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Star Wars, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as opposed to the whole been-there-done-that good versus evil hokum. I also hope that it sucks because I gain sustenance from the tears of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Star Wars </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fanboys whining about how each of the new films somehow ruined their childhoods.</span></p>\n<p><b>“Deadpool 2”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will give “Deadpool”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credit. Despite that its story and villain were the quality of on-campus toilet paper, the sheer strength of Ryan Reynolds’s performance as the titular character sold me, the whole planet and studios everywhere on the power (and potential profitability) of the rated-R superhero film. If “Deadpool 2”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keeps up the self-deprecating, self-aware and hyper-violent nature of the first film, then I have no doubt that it</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will be a riotous affair. Just, please, let there be more to the antagonist than the fact that he shares his name with a brand of soap.</span></p>\n<p><b>“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I loved the late Michael Crichton’s books, and I admire the man as a writer.

That’s how bad of an impression the trailers left on me. Unless this movie somehow lands at least an 80 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, I’m going to say skip this one.</span></p>\n<p><b>“Avengers: Infinity War”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanos, the big purple meanie, has come to Earth, and that means every single Marvel hero has to come together to whup his ass. “Infinity War”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the culmination of 10 years’ worth of movies and god knows how many characters all stuffed into two hours of runtime for a no-holds-barred beatdown of CGI characters flying at each other on screen in what I expect to look like a small child banging action figures together with hapless abandon in an orgy of plastic, CGI fakery. No matter how good or bad the story will be (I don’t imagine that it’s going to be anything mind-blowing), it’s definitely going to be one hell of a sight.</span></p>\n<p><b>“The Incredibles 2”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourteen years later for us, two seconds for the Parr family. In this sequel, Mr. Incredible must deal both with the prospect of his wife Elastigirl overshadowing him in the hero community, as well as his youngest son Jack-Jack acquiring a plethora of highly destructive powers. I am sure that a decent chunk of us all grew up on the first film, so it’s undoubtedly going to be rather strange to watch these characters again since none of them have aged with us. Although Bob Odenkirk’s character is obviously the bad guy based on the trailers, I am excited to see what the Brad Bird sequel we’ve all been clamoring about for so long holds in store.</span></p>\n<p><b>“Rampage”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was going to write a joke about video game movies being masterpieces and then say something about not being able to write that with a straight face, but I’ll just be blunt. I think this movie looks stupid. But unlike “Jurassic World 2,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which I think is destined to rise alongside classic sequels like “Cars 2”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and “Thor: The Dark World</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rampage”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at least looks like it’s compensating for its mind-numbing vapidity with a decent dose of self-awareness and humor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rock plays a scientist who’s befriended a silverback gorilla named George. George starts growing to monstrous heights and has to fight off two more mutant animals: a crocodile and a giant flying wolf.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is my favorite manga franchise. I never got to actually read it, but the original anime and its manga-faithful follow-up are my respective top-two favorite anime. The series has wonderful characterization, amazing world-building, fun humor and an all-around joyous sense of adventure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its live-action adaptation tries and fails miserably to capture that same feeling of wonderment. Alas, most filmic adaptations of manga and anime are doomed to suck, damned to lose their souls as filmmakers fail to grasp what makes them special in the first place. But I was hoping against all hope that this movie would escape that fate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It at least gets the base essentials right, story-wise. Edward and Alphonse are two child prodigies versed in alchemy: the transmutation of different types of matter that allow them to transform objects. When their mother dies, they try to resurrect her, but transmuting humans is alchemy’s one and only major taboo. In the aftermath of their failure, Ed loses an arm and a leg and is forced to bind his little brother to a hulking suit of armor. They spend the next several years of their lives searching for the Philosopher’s Stone in the hopes of restoring their bodies.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the movie makes the one precise mistake adaptations are supposed to avoid: It crams so much of the manga’s story into a theatrical run-time that it is ultimately forced to sacrifice its characters. We hardly ever get to see Ed and Al interact, so we don’t feel the bond they share as brothers. The entire supporting cast, who all had expertly fleshed-out personalities and backstories in the source material (barring General Haruko, who gets more importance here than he ever did in the manga) get no such development here. More often than not, character relationships are developed through painful expositions and clumsily inserted flashbacks. The latter also exposes the film’s pacing problems: Flashbacks that could have and should have been just played out in a linear fashion interrupt scenes at the most opportune moments, killing the pacing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the movie becomes a confusing mess. If you’ve never even read or watched the source material, I imagine watching this movie would be like watching a WWE match for the first time without knowing any of the wrestlers’ backstories and rivalries. It’d be confusing and surreal, but you might be entertained to an extent, albeit embarrassed to admit it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s also another interesting issue with this movie, something that flips a bad trend on its head. When “Ghost in the Shell” came out, it was accused of whitewashing Motoko Kusanagi into Mira Killian, played by Scarlett Johansson. This movie does the opposite: It casts Japanese actors in the roles of Germanic characters. So you have a J-pop idol playing a character named Edward Elric while wearing a blonde wig. Isn’t it awful? Singers shouldn’t be cast in major dramatic roles!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seriously though, it’s kinda weird. It doesn’t damage the movie, but still. Weird. Not as weird as the live-action “Attack on Titan” though. That’s a whole other can of worms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, it’s worth noting that anyone hoping to hear the Funimation dub cast reprise their roles for the first time in seven years will be bound for disappointment. The only English option available is audio description for the blind. I suspect the lack of a dub is because Funimation lost the rights to franchise two years ago, but still, it’s a bummer not to hear Vic Mignogna back as Ed or Travis Willingham as Mustang. The fact that the film is available in four total languages (original Japanese, Spanish, French and German) just rubs more salt into the wound. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film does manage to impress on two fronts, the first being the special effects. Its greatest achievement is Alphonse Elric, whose appearance is completely accurate to his original design and looks amazing, if not completely photo-realistic. The alchemy is always fun to watch, and a certain dog-human hybrid is just as unnerving as it ever was in the anime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second factor is the setting. Despite the fact that Amestris was based on ’30s Germany, the Italian interiors, cities and landscapes all add a genuine beauty to the photography, and in certain scenes the film almost feels like a period piece.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But all that doesn’t change the fact that the story is a veritable clusterfuck of the first third of the source material, with a hint of the last third injected for good measure. So many of the story beats from the early portions of the manga are unceremoniously shoved in that, as a huge fan of both TV shows, I had absolutely no idea what the hell was going on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks goodness then that both anime are both available on Netflix, too. For the love of god, watch those instead. Unless you’re a bored sadist, in which case I imagine there are better uses of your time out there — like watching “Dragonball: Evolution.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wehrung is kidding, of course.

Barring Tom Hiddleston’s Loki, Marvel’s villains are either shallow characters or are downright forgettable. Ronan from “Guardians of the Galaxy” just wanted revenge. Killian (Guy Pearce in “Iron Man 3”) also just wanted revenge. As for Malekith, well, not only did I have to look up his name, but I also cannot remember a single thing he said or did in “Thor: The Dark World.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yes, when you boil it down, Killmonger’s objective is also just revenge. However, it’s revenge rooted in social circumstance. Growing up as a black child in Oakland, Calif. probably isn’t the most pleasant experience, especially after becoming an orphan. Killmonger did not grow up in an affluent, high-tech African nation; he had to struggle in one of America’s most crime-ridden cities and experience prejudice. And I love the fact that the movie doesn’t just say this outright; it’s something that’s heavily implicit. Killmonger’s pain leads him to become the very thing he hates, which makes him a fascinating, complex villain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, Jordan can now safely say that he has escaped the stain on his filmography that is “Fantastic Four.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Killmonger’s partner Ulysses Klaue, a villain returning from</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Age of Ultron,” Andy Serkis seems like he’s having a helluva time playing such a hammy role without having to wear a mo-cap suit. But in the grand scheme of things, Klaue is a throwaway villain and the film spares no time in acknowledging this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the rest of the cast could not be considered throwaways, though. Boseman is back in top form as the Black Panther, King of Wakanda, superhero and sovereign ruler. He’s personable and fights for his country, but the figurative crown doesn’t require him to have a stick up his ass. His sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plays off of him well with her mischievous demeanor and intelligence. She is the film’s heart, as well as its greatest source of comedy (and nifty gadgets).</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81498\" style=\"width: 1191px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1537555068\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81498\" data-attachment-id=\"81498\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/blackpanther-original/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?fit=1181%2C1407&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1181,1407\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BlackPanther Original\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?fit=210%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?fit=860%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81498\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=888%2C1058\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1058\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?w=1181&amp;ssl=1 1181w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=210%2C250&amp;ssl=1 210w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=768%2C915&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=860%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81498\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lily Garcia-Daly / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Danai Gurira of “Walking Dead” fame trades her katana in for a spear and her survival gear for an elaborate, awesome-looking red combat suit as the head of Wakanda’s royal guard. While she kicks the most ass, she’s also part of some ham-fisted drama between herself and her lover W’Kabi, played by Daniel Kaluuya (We know they’re lovers because she tells us they are). After playing such an interesting protagonist in “Get Out,” it’s a shame to see Kaluuya having to portray such a thinly written character who changes allegiances on a dime. Victim to exposition and some truly goofy scenes with CGI rhinos, he is the film’s greatest writing casualty, mostly existing to serve the plot rather than himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of the CGI, “Black Panther” is heavily reliant on it, for both good and ill. It would be pretty much impossible to depict Wakanda in its purple-tinged sci-fi tech glory otherwise, but then you have the final battle with the aforementioned CGI rhinos and a literal catfight between men in mo-cap suits. At that point it looks less like a battle and more like a violent Robert Zemeckis flick. There’s just something about CGI — when used to depict things you could otherwise depict practically — that kills immersion. You can’t have Black Panther fighting Killmonger on a mag-lev train track, of course, but can’t they at least be in actual suits? It’s the movie’s climax; it deserves the feeling of authenticity that had been fairly consistent up until that point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then again, a fight is only as good as the story behind it. It can be flashy, it can look badass, but if you don’t give a shit what’s happening with the characters then the fight is just that. “Black Panther,” besides being about a king fighting for what’s his, also delves into themes of responsibility. Wakanda has the technology and resources to enhance the lives of millions. But should it? T’Challa grapples with this question throughout the film, which drives his decisions and his interactions with his loved ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Killmonger, however, thinks Wakanda ought to arm people of color to rise up against their oppressors. The film is very much interested in observing how people utilize power, both of the fictional superhuman variety and the political variant. In a world where we have politicians making increasingly stupid decisions all across the bloody planet, it’s certainly not something to quickly dismiss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we have a smart Marvel movie that’s not set in New York for once and has an awesome cast to play fascinating characters, a gorgeously rendered setting and an engrossing story that develops its characters well and leaves me excited to see them in a couple more months when “Infinity War” drops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only reason I could find not to see this movie is having to sit through several trailers for what look like progressively shittier movies. That, or you’re an astounding racist. In which case, sucks to be you.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung apologizes in advance if he offends anyone from Oakland. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/","id":5811,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5810,5809,5808],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Blade Runner 2049’ Creates a New Future from the Same Story","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Los Angeles has become a single slab of eternally rain-soaked skyscrapers, the only traces of color coming from gigantic, intelligent holographic advertisements.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Blade Runner 2049” is not a pretty picture of the future. Los Angeles has become a single slab of eternally rain-soaked skyscrapers, the only traces of color coming from gigantic, intelligent holographic advertisements. Apartment building hallways are cramped with the homeless and sick. Flying, heavily armed cars race across the sky as oppressive, electronic tones courtesy of Hans Zimmer blast in your ears. It tells you immediately that the world you see in front of you is oppressive, unpleasant.</p>\n<p>In the midst of this neo-noir destitution, artificially created humans called “replicants” continue to be produced for slave labor. Specialized LAPD detectives called “blade runners” hunt down the older models, many of whom just want to be left alone.</p>\n<p>Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is one such “blade runner.” It quickly becomes clear that K is not a particularly remarkable person; he’s very robotic, stone-faced and unemotional. Although he occasionally questions the ethics of his job, he still carries it out, believing he has no choice in the matter. Even if the film doesn’t dig too deep into initial motivations, K still serves as the catalyst by which the film asks questions regarding the nature of the human and the artificial.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For instance, take K’s holographic girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas). Although copied and pasted from a mass-produced template and encoded onto a thumb drive for the sake of portability, Joi manages to demonstrate a degree of self-awareness. In a stroke of brevity and intelligence, the film never quite makes it clear if her growing independence evolved by itself or was programmed into her. Even though she has at least a small degree of freedom of movement, Joi yearns to overcome her existence as a mere product, seeking emotional fulfillment. I’m not familiar with Ana de Armas or her work, but I think she certainly has the chops to tackle more dramatic roles in the future if she so wishes.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79204\" style=\"width: 1915px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1547592895\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79203\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79204\" data-attachment-id=\"79204\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/unnamed-46/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=1905%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1905,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=888%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79204\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=888%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1905&amp;ssl=1 1905w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=768%2C519&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79204\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of the Movie Database</p></div>\n<p>This desire to be human, or to transcend it, is the thread holding the entire post-Ridley Scott tapestry together. What looks like a very bland story on paper — a cop uncovers a conspiracy with huge ramifications for society — delves into K’s past and forces him to ask himself questions about himself and what it all means for him and for the replicants. The movie continues the story from the original “Blade Runner” in a fascinating way that subversively pulls on tried-and-true sci-fi tropes.</p>\n<p>In the process of K’s investigation, we are introduced to Jared Leto in a role that allows him to spout the most forgettable philosophy babble I’ve heard since “Transcendence.” He’s the face behind the faceless entity that is corporate greed, and as antagonists go, he’s not up to snuff. He emotes very little and there is hardly any backstory present to flesh him out. His henchwoman Luv comes across as more complex, if perhaps a little contradictory. Perhaps, if you listen closely as Leto goes on about the nature of replicants in his silky tones, you might find yourself being lulled into a nap.</p>\n<p>On the flip side of Mr. ASMR, “2049” brings back original “Blade Runner” protagonist Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). While Deckard doesn’t show up until toward the end of the second act, he ties into K’s story in a fascinating, even subversive way that pulls from the events and consequences of the original film. Anyone looking to catch a bone regarding the long-persisting theory regarding whether or not Deckard’s a replicant isn’t going to find anything to gnaw on. It’s no longer his story to question the nature of humanity but instead the implications of it being able to evolve.</p>\n<p>Yes, yes, the movie is not just a philosophical slog, I promise. You’re still going to get some shootouts and good ol’ robot fisticuff brawling. There’s entertainment to be had, but this isn’t joining the likes of “Fury Road” and “The Force Awakens” among the pantheon of 30-years-later blockbuster action sequels. “Blade Runner 2049” takes its time to get to its payoff — perhaps a little too much time. There’s so much excess that an entire subplot alluding to a replicant revolution goes absolutely nowhere. Sequel bait, perhaps? “Blade Runner 2079”?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/","id":5800,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5799,5798,5797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Marshall’ Tackles Racism with Simplicity and Warmth","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Genre-wise, the movie is a simple courtroom drama, reminiscent of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Marshall and Friedman consider all the evidence (or lack thereof) in order to try and prove that their client...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its most basic plot summary, “Marshall” concerns two lawyers working a difficult case. NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall and insurance lawyer Sam Friedman are the defense in the case of Joseph Spell, a black chauffeur accused of the rape and attempted murder of his boss’s wife — who is white — in the 1940s segregationist America. The judge compounds the difficulty of their situation by ruling that Marshall cannot speak during the trial, justifying this by stating he’s an out-of-state lawyer.</p>\n<p>Genre-wise, the movie is a simple courtroom drama, reminiscent of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Marshall and Friedman consider all the evidence (or lack thereof) in order to try and prove that their client is innocent, while arguing in a court with a white judge, jury and prosecution. The odds are astronomically stacked against them, making this very much an underdog story. This is magnified especially since Marshall is fighting on behalf of civil rights, all while risking the reputation of the NAACP by taking on the case.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79206\" style=\"width: 2157px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1444187541\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79205\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79206\" data-attachment-id=\"79206\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/unnamed-1-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=2147%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2147,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=888%2C532&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79206\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=888%2C533\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?w=2147&amp;ssl=1 2147w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C614&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79206\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Broadway Filmore Alive</p></div>\n<p>Even though Marshall and Friedman come from two different social backgrounds and types of legal practices, they have more in common than they think.

Friedman makes it clear that he is neither experienced enough nor happy to be the leading defensive attorney, and Marshall is very much frustrated at having to continually pester Friedman into defending Spell. As the film goes on and their friendship grows, the two wring some warm comedy out of one another, Marshall setting up one particularly rib-tickling joke about Friedman’s courtroom prowess.</p>\n<p>Chadwick Boseman of “Black Panther” and Josh Gad play the two lawyers. According to director Reginald Hudlin, who spoke to Durling at the screening, Boseman was reluctant to take on another historical role after “42” and “Get on Up.” But after reading the script, he was on board to play the Supreme Court justice. He portrays Marshall with a weaponized, steely confidence that makes him immune to the prejudice he encounters. He’s unwilling to give up and bow down despite the daunting odds that he is confronted with. Nevertheless, he is still made vulnerable by tragedies that arise within his own family.</p>\n<p>Gad subtly makes it clear in his first scene, a small courtroom case, that Friedman feels unfulfilled and maybe even a little ashamed about being an insurance lawyer. When he has the opportunity to do some good, he is immediately concerned for his reputation and his family. As he and Marshall dig deeper into the case, Friedman becomes more involved both in Spell’s case and the greater issue of civil rights. Like Marshall, his own family must deal with personal tragedy, his own tied to the conquests of the Nazis.</p>\n<p>At times, though, the film to steers into melodrama. One hokey scene has Marshall stand on the steps of the courthouse and make a big speech about the Constitution to assembled reporters as dramatic music plays. It’s a little much, but the film brings the tone back around through Spell. Sterling K. Brown does a sublime job at playing a terrified man whose innocence is very much in question. His skin color is serving to continue to make his life a living hell. He makes this clear in court with an impassioned speech on what could happen to him as a black man, moving even the ambiguously racist judge (played by James Cromwell).</p>\n<p>The film is based on a true story, with heavy creative input from Friedman’s daughter (who portrays, ironically enough, a racist). As with many films like this one, it’s difficult to discern what is 100 percent true, but that does not take away from the film at all. At the film screening in the Riviera Theatre, Hudlin said he wanted to make a film that would make people come out and tell their friends, “Aw, that movie was so good!” and not “That movie’s really important, you gotta see it.”</p>\n<p>“Marshall” is entertaining, socially relevant and delivers doses of humor to balance out the gravity of the subject matter.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79205\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79205\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/","id":5801,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5800,5799,5798],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Netflix’s Newest Fantasy Series ‘Castlevania’ Has Bite, But Only a Nibble","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-07-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=980%2C578&ssl=1","description":"Netflix's \"Castlevania\" series has the distinction of being the very first video game adaptation to be just okay.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix’s “Castlevania”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series has the distinction of being the very first video game adaptation to be just okay.

But, alas, despite the combined talent, including the likes of established fantasy/sci-fi actors Richard Armitage and James Callis, the show only just manages to distinguish itself from prior crappy video game adaptations by not totally sucking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plot, for those of you who didn’t grow up blowing on the insides of your game cartridges, involves Dracula (Graham McTavish) vowing vengeance on the people of Wallachia after his wife Lisa (Emily Swallow) is burned at the stake. One year later, his giant bat-thing minions are romping around, eating babies, killing peasants and just generally having a grand ol’ time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter Trevor Belmont (Armitage), the whip-wielding vampire hunter with amusingly triangular beard hair and a laughably neat scar over his left eye that often looks purple in the right lighting. Besides being a disappointingly standard reluctant hero, Belmont also serves as the primary exposition machine, almost constantly spouting information about his family in order to explain his character motivations. Because screw nuance and mystery, let’s just tell everyone outright who the hell this guy is and why he’s doing stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s not even an interesting enough story here to utilize Belmont to any interesting degree. In fact, it’s just as standard and cookie-cutter as he is: a hero who doesn’t care about anyone ends up in town. He meets people. He gives a shit. He defends the town. End. Yay! Although perhaps the show can be given credit to adhering more to Western clichés than fantasy ones.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78589\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1267486673\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78588\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78589\" data-attachment-id=\"78589\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=1308%2C578&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1308,578\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=250%2C110&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=888%2C393&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78589 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1-1024x453.png?resize=888%2C393\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=1024%2C453&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=250%2C110&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=768%2C339&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?w=1308&amp;ssl=1 1308w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78589\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What could have potentially remedied this uninspired tale was if any of the secondary characters were able to compensate for Belmont’s dull characterization. Alas, no. Belmont does not interact with very many people and when he does, it’s often just to provide more exposition. His exchange with a villainous bishop (Matt Frewer, who seems to be taking a lot of influence from Tony Jay’s performance in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”) wrangles little tension, the paramount moment of said conversation amounting the bishop to basically just telling Belmont, “Go away.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the best part of the show is its ending, and no, not because it’s over. Belmont and the mage Sypha (Alejandra Reynoso) come across a fan-favorite character and fight him in the season’s final boss battle (after only four episodes, unfortunately). The fight between Belmont and said character is enjoyably frenetic, demonstrating their superhuman abilities to their full degrees and revealing the nature of their characters. It’s a much more satisfying conclusion than a prior battle that the entire season was building up to, which comes and goes with an “eh.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Story aside, what may have been the second-biggest draw for some people was the show being animated. Oftentimes, animation can be the superior medium to deliver a fantasy story, as it forgoes having to build extravagant sets and blow a fortune on CGI. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here though, the animation is about on par with your average modern anime. People and creatures are all drawn, whereas the backgrounds are all obviously computer generated. But with the characters being consistently on-model and some killer lighting (evoking fellow vampire series “Hellsing Ultimate” at points), it gets the job done, even if every so often, there are a couple small mishaps involving mechanical lips and wonky arms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering it’s tantalizingly short length, “Castlevania” is better off being binged as a film, maybe on a boring summer day, because this is not Netflix’s big new hit by any means. It’s fun at times, but it does not exceed in any particular area to be considered anything other than a light snack. The series itself is also, I think, too old for our age group to cull any personal investment in seeing the famous game series be adapted to television.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung likes the movie “Super Marios Bros.,” so take his opinion with a grain of salt. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78588\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78588\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/","id":5785,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5784,5783,5782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Beloved Cartoon ‘Samurai Jack’ Comes and Goes","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samurai_Jack.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samurai_Jack.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The show made its long-awaited return in March. But the show’s return is also indicative of a current trend in the television landscape: the appeal to nostalgia.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This Saturday, “Samurai Jack” will come to an end, 16 years after it first began.</p>\n<p>The show made its long-awaited return in March. Although it had been 14 years for us, for Jack himself, it had been 50. During that time, the wandering samurai went through several traumatic events that left him without his sword, his optimism and his humanity. This change of tone allowed creator Genndy Tartakovsky to forego the original show’s episodic format in favor of a serialized journey.</p>\n<p>As a result, we got an emotionally harrowing tale of a worn-down Jack, who has by now gone full Mad Max, riding a motorcycle and shooting guns. He fights his suicidal guilt over not only failing to return to the past to save his family, but also failing to save those who have fallen victim to the rule of Aku (now voiced by Greg Baldwin). Meanwhile, Jack must confront and face newcomer Ashi (Tara Strong, a.k.a. Timmy Turner), a woman with a traumatic past who is more than capable of kicking Jack’s ass. Together, they endure many misadventures that allow us to ease back into the wonderfully weird world of our favorite time-displaced samurai.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Notably, the switch from plain old Cartoon Network to the Adult Swim time slot allowed the show to be grittier, bloodier, more emotionally wrenching and gave us the line, “Woah, what a freak. Looked like a talking penis,” from Tom Kenny (the voice of Spongebob Squarepants).</p>\n<p>This change in tone is welcome, as everyone who watched “Jack” as a child (myself included) have all grown up. While I wouldn’t say we were hungry for guts and gore (which this season has used sparingly), we certainly came to expect something more engrossing that would justify the series’s 13-year absence. We got it.</p>\n<p>Holy shit did we. But the show’s return is also indicative of a current trend in the television landscape: the appeal to nostalgia.</p>\n<p>No-brainer, right? If it was popular once, why not bring it back (cough someone renew “Firefly” dammit cough)?  We’re seeing the likes of “Twin Peaks,” “Gilmore Girls,” “Voltron,” “24,” “Arrested Development,” “Ben 10,” “Dragon Ball Super,” “Young Justice,” et cetera, et cetera, coming back from the grave (or at least from the line at the morgue). All of these shows are either revivals or sequels of a once-popular franchise that has been kept alive via an intravenous stream of fan demand. The market for nostalgia is exploding.</p>\n<p>You can see this pretty clear within season five of “Jack” itself.  Although technology has marched on (everything is animated digitally), the show’s visual style has stayed almost exactly the same, despite Taratovsky having experimented with other styles and formats. There’s an episode where Ashi runs into a whole plethora of characters from the original run of “Samurai Jack.” The re-animated flashback scenes are staged almost exactly like the original versions, setting up the viewer for an emotional reminiscence before eventually getting back to the action at hand.</p>\n<p>Basically, TV shows have discovered that the best way to rein us in is tossing a barbed lasso around our hearts and memories. As cheesy and stupid a metaphor as that sounds (you can see why I am not a poet), it sure as hell works. The last two “Star Wars” movies made more than a billion dollars at the box office. So did “Beauty and the Beast.” There’s even a “live-action” “The Lion King” coming up and I will bet my firstborn — whenever they come into existence — that it will make just as much money as the aforementioned films.</p>\n<p>Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily. We get to see the stories of stuff we love re-imagined and the people who took the effort of others and gave it a new coat of paint get a shitload of money … hm.</p>\n<p>Okay, let’s look at it another way. These continuations of our childhoods allow us, I believe, to stop and reflect for a moment on how we’ve grown. We can see how culture has aged with us; we get to reflect on why we fell in love with these shows in the first place. Or maybe we’re just children in the bodies of college students. If so, I’d like to propose a resolution to A.S. that we place a giant ball pit in front of Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, where was I? Ah, right. This Saturday, “Samurai Jack” will end. How? Who knows? But after so many years, many of us will gain closure. We will get to see a journey we’ve been watching since 2001 finally come to an end, along with a chapter of our childhoods. There better be gallons of blood all over the screen.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung clearly has no idea what the hell he is talking about and it’s a wonder we haven’t fired him yet.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/","id":5807,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5806,5805,5804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Ghost in the Hollow Shell of a Movie","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ghost-in-the-shell-2017-trailer-ed.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ghost-in-the-shell-2017-trailer-ed.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Ghost in the Shell” also tries to distract you from the shortcomings of its plot by shoving enough holograms in your face to make you see binary code. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ghost in the Shell” sets a shining standard of mediocrity for action films and further serves as proof that live-action manga adaptations (well, more like anime adaptations, in this case) are generally not good ideas. Of course, giving writing duties to one of the minds behind “Transformers” hardly helps. The final product is a substandard action film that drowns the humanistic themes of its source material under a deluge of headache-inducing CGI cityscapes and a painfully bland corporate conspiracy story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scarlett Johansson plays Major Mira Killian, the first person to have their brain inserted into a purely cybernetic body. As a result, she can hack into the cyberbrains of other people and has superhuman abilities. Basically, she’s playing Black Widow again, but now her skin-tight bodysuit is flesh-toned. After her transformation, the corporate mind behind the Major’s creation, Cutter, comes up with the brilliant idea of taking this investment he holds so dear to his heart and putting her in a counter-terrorism unit. Smart business move there, bud. Put your experimental business asset in a profession in which getting a bullet in the ass is right in the job description. Then again, what can one expect when the film’s idea of a pre-asskicking one-liner is “The truth is … I wasn’t built to dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Major spends the first third of her own screen-time questioning her humanity, a theme central to the original manga source material that depicts a world in which cybernetic augmentation is as common as wearing a watch. The film makes this abundantly clear to us by showing a variety of humans who have undergone some sort of modification or other: chips in the brain to play music, cybernetic eyes, stuff like that. However, this deep thematic content goes down the toilet pretty fast in favor of “Matrix”-esque gunfights (in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow motion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and the tortuously cliché story of the super-agent searching for their forgotten past. Hey, DreamWorks. Jason Bourne called. He wants his plot back. Oh, and he’s also suing for defamation.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ghost in the Shell” also tries to distract you from the shortcomings of its plot by shoving enough holograms in your face to make you see binary code. Every 10 minutes or so, you’re treated to the sight of gigantic, colorful holographic advertisements pulled straight out of “Blade Runner” and waving at you. Once, it’s cool. Twice, it’s artistic. Eight times and the scenery is not only overpowering whatever character is in the shot, but the movie is also treating you like a complete moron. Yes, I know it’s a sci-fi movie, thank you very much. Now get to the next scene before I decide to go sneak in to see “Logan.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps my analysis is a little too harsh. The film is at least visually inventive and arresting, that much can be said. Holograms aren’t used in any groundbreaking story manner, but in small touches, like having them disintegrate like sand upon the end of a conversation, which lends at least a little personality to their measly existence.  And the Major’s deep dive, her hacking into another cyber-brain, provides for a darkly hallucinatory experience (albeit one that is, weirdly enough, evocative of both “Code Lyoko” and Kingdom Hearts)</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all its attempts to divert your attention that there is little under the surface of this shell, the third act kicks in hard. As the pieces fall into place, things actually start getting at least a little interesting when the questions about the Major’s identity are answered. The thing is, as someone who was at least a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">little </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">familiar with the source material, I was able to see the twist coming from a mile off.  Maybe others won’t and will be blown away by it. The interesting question though, without giving too much away, is can a movie be truly accused of whitewashing when the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">character </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">herself has been literally whitewashed?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the film does not seem to care about the implications, nor does the protagonist dwell upon her revelation. “Ghost in the Shell” is still a dumb action movie, ground into a pulp by the Hollywood wringer. It may look somewhat the same as Masamune Shirow’s work, but its soul has been rent and mangled, rendered unrecognizable. The best I can say about the movie is that it takes the indecipherable technobabble of its source material and trades it in for a couple of entertaining and occasionally seizure-inducing combat scenes.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fellow Artsweek writer Ryan Hykes rates this movie an 8/10.  And that’s why he writes album reviews.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/","id":5833,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5832,5831,5830],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Directors Honored at SBIFF","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Outstanding Directors Award ceremony was held on Feb. 7, with the Arlington Theatre playing host to such acclaimed filmmakers as Damien Chazelle, Ava DuVernay, Barry Jenkins, Kenneth Lonergan and ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from celebrating the stars in front of the camera, the Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) also takes the time to praise the artists behind it.

After an eight-year hiatus from filmmaking, he made “Moonlight”, a film about a Miami teen struggling with issues of family and sexuality. Its success made Jenkins the first African-American to earn Oscar nominations for directing, writing, and best picture. It premiered, fittingly enough, at Telluride. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was cool as hell,” Jenkins said, grinning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film, he said, had much personal significance to him and the man who wrote the play on which it was based, Tarell Alvin McCraney. Both of them had cocaine-addicted mothers, and Naomie Harris plays one in the film. Jenkins had to hold his ears backstage so he wouldn’t hear the clip featuring her, the memories still fresh in his mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kenneth Lonergan, writer and director of “Manchester by the Sea”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">followed Jenkins. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was able to briefly converse with him:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wehrung: Why was the setting of Manchester so important to the film and to Lee?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lonergan:  I guess because of the way the script developed. It started out as an arbitrary choice, and then I did a lot of research on the town. I think just all the elements of the environment of a story can be really important part of it.  If you think of movies like “The Last Picture Show” or “Hell or High Water,” for instance, and “Moonlight” … you don’t want “Moonlight” to be anywhere but Miami, and it really couldn’t be, in a way. It’s a little hard to say why. I think a place has a personality just like a person does, and once you’ve got that personality into the story, it’s hard to imagine it without it.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film’s (impressively heart-wrenching) story was the brainchild of John Krasinski and Matt Damon, who dropped out of directing and starring duties. The role of the emotionally detached protagonist Lee Chandler ended up going to Casey Affleck, earning him an Oscar nod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s just incredible,” Lonergan praised him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Primarily a writer, Lonergan has been practicing his craft since the fifth grade. He did copious amounts of research regarding the film’s setting, allowing him to incorporate minute details such as that the nearest hospital to Manchester is in Beverly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m always very interested in the life led [in the places I go.] Everywhere just has a different feel to it,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the film’s extremely dour subject matter, Lonergan made sure to incorporate some humor into it, as “without the humor, the movie’s dead.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there was Denis Villeneuve, who also made himself available for a brief red carpet interview. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75633\" style=\"width: 177px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1579677773\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75630\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75633\" data-attachment-id=\"75633\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/outstanding-director-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Outstanding Director-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75633\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2-167x250.jpg?resize=167%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"167\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75633\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wehrung: Your screenwriter Eric [Heisserer] came to UCSB a little while ago, and he said he talked to you about things like politics and religion together.

The problem with modern sci-fi films, Villeneuve said, is that they have a “lack of freshness” on account of being more about the technology than the ideas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On “Arrival”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itself, Villeneuve said, “Amy [Adams] was my muse.  She was my first choice,” and, “For me, the movie was about this woman’s journey and her revelation about death.” One thing he tried very hard to avoid was crafting the film in a way that information would be spoon-fed to the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening capped off with (as is SBIFF tradition) all five directors taking the stage to discuss their early cinematic influences with Hammond, with answers ranging from “Star Wars”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to Disney</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then “Risky Business”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">director Paul Brickman took the stage to praise his peers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were two common threads [of tonight’s films]: a strong emotional center and, in this corporate world of ours, these were fiercely personal visions. It gives me a lot of hope,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noting that members of the Directors Guild of America had considerably short lifespans, he quipped, “Let’s get these awards out while they’re still healthy,” and the five thus received their very pointy gold trophies from volunteers before standing up for a final round of photos.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/","id":5830,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5829,5828,5827],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Moonlit Evening with the Stars of ‘La La Land’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-13.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-13.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The two stars of “La La Land” had come to receive their Outstanding Performers of the Year Awards alongside their director, Damien Chazelle.

Hundreds of fans screaming in unison heralded their arrival at the Arlington Theatre as they stepped out of their midnight-black cars. The two stars of “La La Land” had come to receive their Outstanding Performers of the Year Awards alongside their director, Damien Chazelle.</p>\n<p>After the picture-palace had filled every seat, Board President Lynda Weinman emerged to thank the show’s sponsors and drew attention to how SBIFF is, unlike many other festivals, primarily educational. Then she introduced the show’s veteran moderator for the evening, Roger Durling, who hailed the night’s guests as “intelligent and amiable” and “an average-looking sex-symbol.” Whomever he was referring to is up to you.</p>\n<p>Then the lights dimmed and a montage of the two performers’ roles played onscreen to the tune of the film’s opening song, “Another Day of Sun,” played live on a century-old organ. After it sank beneath the floor, Gosling and Stone walked onstage to a standing ovation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It did not take either of them long to charm the already won-over audience, with a stoic Gosling dryly noting that the photographers camping out in front of the stage were shooting his every twitch.

If only she could hear the man in the audience whose laughs sounded like a duck’s mating call.</p>\n<p>Their careers were reviewed through clips and Durling’s commentary: Gosling rose to dramatic prominence as a Jewish Nazi in Henry Bean’s “The Believer,” despite Bean’s skepticism over the role going to a “Mickey Mouse Club” alumnus.

She eventually came to win the hearts of her fans in “Superbad” and “Zombieland.”The two first appeared alongside each other in “Crazy, Stupid, Love” and established a rapport after improvising together during their audition.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75548\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"465873950\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75543\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75548\" data-attachment-id=\"75548\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-moonlit-night-with-the-stars-of-la-la-land/la-la-land-by-jenny-luo-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"La La Land by Jenny Luo-11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-75548 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-11.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75548\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Gosling wound up getting involved with “La La Land” when he recognized Chazelle in a restaurant and approached him.

Fans eager to get a closer glimpse or even a photo stood behind metal barriers being carefully monitored by security guards. Gosling emerged to renewed squeals with Stone following right behind.

After all, it was in the original opening crawl: a bunch of rebels steal the Death Star plans. So the inherent question here is this: How can a film possibly entertain when one already knows the outcome?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer to that comes partially on the strength of its characters. In lieu of Jedi going on journeys of self-discovery or contrived romances, we have a dirtier story with a group of soldiers who look like they could use a good shower by the end. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is a prisoner of the Empire, rescued and tasked by the Rebel Alliance to track down her father Galen Erso, essentially the Robert Oppenheimer of this universe, so that they may find the plans to the Death Star and subsequently blow it up. Along the way, she and rebel operative Cassian Andor drag some fellow colorful badasses into their fight against the space Nazis and Imperial sleaze-ball Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn).  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones brings a sufficient degree of capability to Jyn. The character can fend for herself and gradually learns to hope again in the midst of a war, although her reactions to some events do seem to be a bit tepid at times. Cassian is also gifted with a subtle complexity, as he bounces back between ruthlessness and sentiment.  Also included in the camaraderie of space warriors includes the dry-witted droid K-2SO and likable, blind super-badass Chirrut Îmwe</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(played by Donnie Yen, aka the Ip Man), who are welcome additions to the saga. Expect to see the Mouse milk them for all they’re worth in merchandising.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side of the fight, Mendelsohn’s Krennic comes across as quite a unique villain in the film series. Unlike the typical evil space wizards we’ve become accustomed to seeing, he’s not really looking for power, despite being in charge of the Death Star. He’s just some egotistical boot-licker who wants Palpatine to pat him on the head and make him feel special. Thrawn he is not, but still a breath of fresh air he is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the film does suffer from the fact that it has a fairly large cast and only two hours to develop them. Besides Jyn, nobody else gets a lot of time to establish how they reached where they are today and why they make the choices they do. And if any of you are “Clone Wars”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fans, you’ll be scratching your heads about how Saw Gerrera went from freeing the oppressed to leading a group of rebel extremists that toss grenades into crowded marketplaces, although apparently “Rebels” might address that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plot-wise, “Rogue One”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does feel sort of familiar. Despite the fact that we’ve already seen two Star Wars movies about getting important information to the rebellion, the film</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enraptures on the strength of its sense of scale and battle scenes.  Director Gareth Edwards, who rose to prominence for directing “Godzilla,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proves once again that he knows how to utilize scale to great effect. Spaceships and planets feel appropriately massive and intimidating. Even when tiny characters are framed against a gigantic explosion, you still feel the dread of it as it chases after the rebels.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when the action gets going, by god does it deliver. The film’s final battle scene, from a pure entertainment standpoint, felt supremely satisfying — even more than the battles in “The Force Awakens.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sweeping war scene spans the land, air and space on a scale never before seen in a Star Wars film, and its conclusion ties neatly into “A New Hope</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some have commented about this being the first Star Wars film to be truly about war and its consequences. I’d say aside from the clichéd trope of a child crying in the midst of a firefight standing around like they’re waiting to be shot, you’re not going to find any commentary about the meaning of war or the like. This is still an action blockbuster after all.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s only so much more I can discuss here without spoiling something.  There are plenty of callbacks to all eras of Star Wars: the originals, the prequels and even the TV show “Rebels</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether or not you’re familiar with any of these, “Rogue One”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can still stand apart as a fun film in its own right. It divorces itself from the traditional Star Wars formula while staying firmly rooted in its universe, making it quite the rogue one. Ah. I see what they did there.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No he didn’t. He read that on Wookiepedia.</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Spoilerish</b> <b>addendum</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (read at thy own risk): I wrote this review before Carrie Fisher passed away. The timing of her death has caused Leia’s appearance at the film’s end to transform from something that, upon first viewing, just served as a nostalgia-tickling moment but turned into something more bittersweet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we really weren’t actually seeing Fisher receiving the plans (it was her 19-year-old face digitally replacing Ingvild Deila’s), it is sad to consider that this is sort of her last Star Wars movie to have come out when she was alive. It will make seeing her one last time in Episode VIII all the more melancholy and her absence in Episode IX all the more biting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through and through, Carrie Fisher was an icon of Hollywood and sci-fi. Her face was everywhere — on-screen, book covers and, of course, on action figures. Leia was the first badass female movie hero to enter the cultural mainstream; she got by on sass, know-how and proficiency with an assortment of lethal weaponry, helping to turn Fisher into one of the most well-known feminist icons of the screen. Later on in life, she became an advocate for those suffering from addiction and mental illness, becoming one of the most prolific Star Wars alumni to address real-life issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now she is gone and that really sucks, not only because of the gap she leaves behind, but also considering that her passing is yet another reminder that time marches on and bits of our childhood will one day, indeed, evaporate. However, as fans, we’ll some day get over it. Hopefully, at the very least, they will be able to find solace in what a huge inspiration and comfort Carrie Fisher was to people all around the Earth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodbye, Miss Fisher. The world is not quite as awesome without you. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74660\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74660\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/","id":5837,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5836,5835,5834],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/739"}},"__N_SSG":true}
