The Highlanders were able to hand UCSB an upset loss in their previous matchup this season, just under a month ago on Oct. 14.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Both of UCSB’s opponents will have Tuesday evening matches before their weekend tilts, allowing the Gauchos a slight advantage in preparation.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">The Titans offensive attack is led by sophomore outside hitters Shimen Fayad and Madeline Schneider who average 3.53 and 3.06 kills per set in Big West play, respectively. Both rank within the top 15 in the conference for the statistic, although both hold hitting percentages below .180, hindering the team’s offensive efficiency.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Freshman setter Rachel Hall is responsible for getting Fayad and Schneider the looks they need, and she leads her team in conference play with 8.0 assists per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Defensively, the Titans have received consistent input from their liberos — freshman Madisen Babich and sophomore Torrey Tinney — both of whom join Fayad in the top 16 for digs among Big West competition, and average at least 2.60 per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">UC Riverside is led by freshman outside hitter Mickayla Sherman, who blew up against the Gauchos in their last match, leading the Highlanders with 26 kills (.400 kill percentage), 11 digs and three block assists. She’s been the Big West’s sixth- most prolific scorer through the conference schedule so far this season and will be the main advisory for the Gauchos on Saturday.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle paces her team with 9.30 assists per set, good for seventh in the conference against Big West competition. The Gauchos will have to look out for her on the serve, too, as her 0.36 service aces per set are good for fourth in conference play.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Senior libero Maddie Hubbell leads her team on the defensive end of the court, ranking sixth in Big West play in digs with 4.11 per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">The Gauchos continue to rely heavily on the offensive prowess of redshirt freshman outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins who holds sixth place in the conference in kills per set against conference opponents with 3.54. She’s coming off 31 kills in last weekend’s matches, and the Gauchos will need a similar effort from Ruddins to keep their winning streak alive.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Ruddins’s stellar weekend performance resulted in her earning her fifth Big West Freshman of the Week honor on Monday. Along with redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley receiving the accolade last week, it is now three consecutive weeks in which a Gaucho has been selected for the weekly conference award.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi has upheld the core of the UCSB defense, contributing 4.53 digs per set and leading the team to three game sweeps in two of its last three matches.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">Producing at the net has been senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield, who has recently emerged for the Gauchos, registering 23 kills and seven blocks on the weekend.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">The setter position was an inconsistent area for the Gauchos last season, but this year Juley has taken hold of the spot and remains helpful throughout the team’s rotations. She’s averaged 10.33 assists per set against conference play and piled up 77 assists over last weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">If UCSB can win these next two matches, that will be six straight for the Gauchos, and they may well take third place in the Big West from Cal Poly.</p>\n<p class=\"m_1659308628285565471gmail-Body\">UCSB will host Cal State Fullerton on Friday, Nov. 11, while UC Riverside will make the trip to the Central Coast to face the Gauchos on Saturday, Nov. 12. Both matches are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/gauchos-peaking-towards-seasons-ending-at-home-for-weekend/","id":4993,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4992,4991,4990],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Winners in Four Straight, Sweeps UCD & UCI Over Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winners in five of its last six matches, the UCSB women's volleyball team has now won four consecutive matches after defeating UC Davis and UC Irvine over the weekend.

Their .029 hitting percentage looked even worse against the Aggies’ .400 mark, and they would go on to lose by 10 points despite first-year outside hitter Megan Rice’s four kills.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos got out to an early lead, a 6-1 Davis run would put the Gauchos in a 9-12 hole, and they weren’t able to close the gap under two for the remainder of the set.</p>\n<p>Facing an end to their recent hot streak, the Gauchos launched their comeback in the third set when an 8-9 deficit became a 16-9 lead, aided by seven straight Ruddins serves.</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Annie Hasselmann started the run with a kill on an assist by redshirt sophomore defensive specialist Sydney Bast, followed by senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and Hasselmann contributing a block to further shift the tide.</p>\n<p>A Ruddins service ace pushed the lead to two, tying the second highest lead to that point in the set, and a kill from Elizabeth Sheffield resulted in a UC Davis timeout.</p>\n<p>They would find no help in the respite, however, as an attack error from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom, followed by two Ruddins service aces and another Sheffield kill, capped the stretch at 16-9 UCSB, a buffer that would extend throughout the set.</p>\n<p>UC Davis would not go down easily in the fourth set, as three kills from first-year outside hitter Lauren Matias contributed to a five-point run that would tie the game at 12.</p>\n<p>Despite the burst, UCSB would never trail again, as a continuous back-and-forth culminated with two kills from first-year outside hitter Chloe Allen and a 25-23 Gaucho victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB controlled the tiebreaker, hitting a whopping .538 and winning 15-6, as after the Aggies took a 2-0 lead to start, a 12-3 run by the Gauchos would essentially seal the match.</p>\n<p>The comeback from a two-set deficit was enabled by a career evening from outside hitter Chloe Allen, whose 19 kills, .394 hitting percentage, six digs and two block assists were massive for the Gauchos, especially as junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman went down with an injury in last week’s match against Cal Poly and was unable to play against Davis.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins and Elizabeth Sheffield were also both rocking on the offensive end with 16 and 14 kills respectively. Ruddins added three service aces as well as 10 digs to give herself a double-double, and Sheffield continued her consistent efficiency, hitting .481 on the night.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley led the match with 40 assists and completed a double-double of her own with 11 digs, extending her streak of outstanding play that has coincided with the Gauchos’ recent run.</p>\n<p>The Aggies had five players finish with at least eight kills, paced by senior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht with 11. Their setters, sophomore Maddie Merlino and senior Sophia Mar, combined for 43 assists, as the two setters’ attack potency was on full display Thursday night.</p>\n<p>UC Davis outside hitters first-year Lauren Matias and sophomore Emily Allen collected 11 digs each, completing double-doubles with their kills, and Sophia Mar’s 11 digs also gave her a double-double for the match.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match with UC Irvine was substantially less dramatic, exemplified by the Gauchos outhitting the Anteaters by at least .050 in each of the three sets.</p>\n<p>The first set was the match’s closest, as despite holding a three-to-four-point lead for the majority of the frame, the Anteaters were able to get a couple big scores and pull within two when faced with game point 24-20.</p>\n<p>An attack error on senior setter Shelley Anderson would seal their fate, however, as UC Irvine couldn’t capitalize on what would be their high watermark of the evening.</p>\n<p>The second and final sets would play out similarly to one another, as both began with decent competition between the two teams; they were tied at 11 in the second, and the Gauchos held an 11-10 run in the third.</p>\n<p>Massive runs in each game by the Gauchos would follow in each set, however, and neither featured any substantial late-set drama.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was huge for the Gauchos in this one, with 15 kills, eight service aces and nine digs, almost completing a triple-double. Megan Rice, Chloe Allen, Elizabeth Sheffield and senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt would all assist her offensively, chipping in at least seven kills apiece.</p>\n<p>Libero Emilia Petrachi turned in a brilliant performance with 20 digs (6.67 digs per set), and set the tone for what was an unstoppable Gaucho defense. Sheffield assisted in three blocks, and Hannah Juley and Sydney Bast added seven and 11 digs respectively.</p>\n<p>No one on UC Irvine was able to amass double-digit kills, though junior libero Luna Tsujimoto led the match with 22 digs.</p>\n<p>Setter Shelley Anderson was also potent for the Anteaters, her 27 assists a team high and second in the match only to UCSB’s Hannah Juley, who finished with 10 more.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try and push their winning streak to five next weekend at home, with Friday and Saturday matches against Cal state Fullerton and UC Riverside, respectively. Both matches are at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/","id":4998,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4997,4996,4995],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakes Remain High With UCSB On Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite no real shot at representing the Big West in the NCAA Tournament, the UCSB women's volleyball team remains motivated to win out the remainder of the season.

She stands at fourth in the conference in digs per set against Big West foes with 4.24.</p>\n<p>The engine of their offense is powered by senior setter Sophia Mar and sophomore Maddie Merlino, who have put up 6.24 assists per set and 5.73 assists per set, respectively, against Big West competition.</p>\n<p>Their two pronged attack will be an adjustment for the Gauchos, as they’ve played against one setter for their past three matches.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine has similarly won three of its past five matches. The differences between the two teams, however, include Irvine’s ability to come away with at least one set against Hawaii and fortune to hand Long Beach State its first loss of the season in five sets.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters will try and rebound from a devastating loss in their final match last weekend against Cal State Northridge after having been ahead by two sets.</p>\n<p>Clearly a team with considerable upside after their recent results, Irvine has relied on redshirt senior outside hitter Victoria Dennis and sophomore opposite hitter Harlee Kekauoha against conference competition, as the duo has averaged 3.43 and 2.82 kills per set respectively.</p>\n<p>Kekauoha also leads the Big West with .64 service aces per set in conference play. She has a total of 11 total service aces thus far this season.</p>\n<p>Senior setter Shelley Anderson greases the wheels for the Anteaters, contributing 10.22 assists per set, the fifth most prolific mark against Big West teams this season.</p>\n<p>The defensive effort is centered around junior libero Luna Tsujimoto, whose 4.15 digs per set place her just behind Davis’s Malia Bolko in the conference. First-year middle blocker Makayla Wolfe adds 1.42 blocks per set, the only non-Hawaii player in the stats top four during the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>This weekend the Gauchos will rely heavily on sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi, who has consistently made her case as the league’s best defender and continues to lead the Big West with 4.62 digs per set when matched up with conference opponents.</p>\n<p>Redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley will look to continue her ascent as her stellar play has begun to receive recognition; she was named Big West Freshman of the Week after her dominant outing in San Luis Obispo this past weekend, and her 10.49 assists per set still rank third in Big West play.</p>\n<p>The offense will continue to be driven by redshirt first-year Lindsey Ruddins, who has dominated with 3.44 kills per set in conference play, and junior Chanel Hoffman (3.19 kills per set in conference), who has been the keystone for UCSB’s season thus far.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blockers Elizabeth Sheffield and Phoebe Grunt will look to continue a hot streak of play where opponents have had major difficulties attacking the Gauchos at the net.</p>\n<p>Winners of two straight and riding a wave of excellent play, the Gauchos are poised to assert themselves as postseason threats in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match with the Aggies will be at 7 p.m. on Nov. 3 in Davis, after which they will get a day of rest. The Gauchos then travel to Irvine for Saturday’s 7 p.m. match with the Anteaters on Nov. 5.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November, 3 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73706\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73706\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/","id":5452,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5451,5450,5449],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Season Series vs. Mustangs, Earns Sweep","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With one match on its schedule last week, the UCSB women's volleyball team was able to avoid a season sweep by its Blue-Green rival Cal Poly with a 3-0 victory over the Mustangs.

Freshman redshirt setter Hannah Juley was her usual self, accumulating 10 assists in the first frame, right in line with her current average of 10.49 per set in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The second go was much tighter between the rivals, with four lead changes preceding a kill from junior outside hitter Raeanne Greisen to reach Cal Poly’s high water mark in the set, a 10-8 lead.</p>\n<p>A string of two Mustang service errors and two attack errors swung the score back into UCSB’s favor, a lead they would not relinquish for the rest of the set. Errors would be a thorn in the side of this Cal Poly team, as they went on to commit 11 in the set and 25 in the match, 10 more than UCSB’s total.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt put the team on her back in the set with four kills, including the game clincher, three of which were assisted by Juley.</p>\n<p>Griesen tried her best to keep the Mustangs in the set, piling up seven kills and contributing heavily to a late 7-1 run that would tie the set. A block from junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman and Sheffield followed by Grunt’s kill would seal the second frame for the Gauchos, however, putting the Gauchos in position to fulfill their first three-set sweep in conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the game strong with Sheffield and Juley starting the scoring with a shared block, followed by a Sheffield kill assisted by Juley.</p>\n<p>After a four point run, including back-to-back kills from Greisen, gave the Mustangs the lead, UCSB would play from a two to five point deficit until the final moments of the set.</p>\n<p>Down 20-23, the Gauchos found themselves in what has been a familiar position as of late: performers of two outstanding opening sets, but incapable of completing a sweep. The result was a heartbreaking comeback for Long Beach last weekend, and an unnecessarily late challenge from Cal State Northridge in the following match.</p>\n<p>Greisen brought her team to the brink with a kill assisted by junior setter Taylor Nelson, but this time around, UCSB was not to be denied.</p>\n<p>With Juley serving, the Gauchos would ride her endgame heroics to the tune of six straight points.</p>\n<p>First came a Grunt kill on an assist by Juley, who followed by setting up freshman outside hitter Chloe Allen for her fifth kill of the set. Allen only played in the one game, but was instrumental in the Gauchos’ offensive firepower to close the match.</p>\n<p>Following Allen’s kill, Juley was at it again with back-to-back service aces that tied the score at 24 apiece. Another Juley serve would eventually result in an attack error for sophomore outside hitter Adlee Van Winden, giving the Gauchos an opportunity for their first conference sweep of the season.</p>\n<p>Juley would strike again, as her fifth consecutive serve would lead to a kill from freshman outside hitter Megan Rice, once again on her own assist.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would have three players finish with double-digit points, led by Ruddins who finished with a double-double on 10 kills and 10 digs, not to mention two block assists and two service aces.</p>\n<p>Seniors Grunt and Sheffield would also finish with 10 and 13 points, respectively, totaling seven kills each. Sheffield was also a monster on defense near the net with eight assisted blocks.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi racked up 15 digs, slightly above her conference average of 4.62 per set.</p>\n<p>Juley was the star of the match, though, as her 31 assists, two service aces, 11 digs, five block assists and two kills on five attempts proved her ubiquity throughout the evening.</p>\n<p>Greisen was unstoppable for the Mustangs, killing 15 attacks, though the Gauchos did a good job of limiting Van Winden (fifth in Big West with 3.80 kills), as she was held to a .069 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Katherine Brouker led the match with 16 kills as she maintained her position as one of the best liberos in the Big West and improved her digs per set to 4.34, third in Big West conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finally sit at 5-5 in the conference and will look to continue their excellent streak of play next weekend against UC Davis on Thursday, Nov. 3, and UC Irvine on Saturday, Nov. 5. Both matches are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

As soon as I met the team and the coaches I fell in love with the school.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Since arriving a little over two years ago, Hoffman has been invaluable to this Gaucho squad. She began her collegiate career playing outside hitter in all 27 of UCSB’s matches, something that, as a first-year, gave her insight into the importance of hard work.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely a big transition coming from high school to college; every athlete knows that,” Hoffman said. “The biggest thing is that as soon as you come in, you have to have the same maturity as everyone else. Once you’re in college, age doesn’t matter. You have to just work for your spot.”</p>\n<p>Hoffman immediately proved herself a worthy contributor on the court, and by season’s end, she’d racked up almost 230 kills on an average of 2.34 per set, both of which ranked in the top four on the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgement for her play would come soon, as she was awarded Big West Freshman of the Week honors, earned a place on the All-Big West Freshman Team and received an honorable mention for the All-Big West Team itself.</p>\n<p>“It was a great experience,” Hoffman reminisced. “I was able to play with all the seniors that left, and I learned a lot from them.”</p>\n<p>The team found decent success with a 13-14 overall record and an 8-8 mark in conference play. While slightly down from the wildly successful 2013 season in which the Gauchos went 13-3 and won a share of the Big West crown, the season was a useful development period for Hoffman and UCSB’s other younger players.</p>\n<p>After such a stellar start to her UCSB career, Hoffman’s continued improvement was seemingly inevitable in her sophomore campaign.</p>\n<p>Through non-conference play last season, her game was clearly growing and becoming more efficient. While Hoffman’s offensive production dropped somewhat with only 1.95 kills per set in her sophomore campaign, her kill percentage rose from .138 in her first-year season to .221 in her second.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 25, the Gauchos were handed a 3-0 sweep by a Hawaii team that would go on to an undefeated conference schedule. Hoffman lead the team that night with seven kills and only one error on 18 attacks (.333 kill percentage) and added 11 digs.</p>\n<p>“It was such a sudden injury,” Hoffman recalled. “I actually played on it the rest of the match. It was in a tournament here, and then we travelled to Hawaii and I played on it there. I found out after we came back.”</p>\n<p>After learning that she’d torn her PCL, Hoffman would have to begin the long road to recovery.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73476\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2062297678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73498\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73476\" data-attachment-id=\"73476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/wvball_vsucd-161006-dustinharris-04-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"wvball_vsucd-161006-dustinharris-04-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73476\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=335%2C502\" alt=\"Chanel Hoffman serves with topspin to the deep corner.

Both marks rank ninth in the Big West, as she’s established herself as one of the best outside hitters in the conference. She’s been killing her attacks at a .237 mark, and is one of five UCSB players in the Big West’s top 25 for the statistic.</p>\n<p>The junior outside hitter is tied for 11th in the conference with 19 service aces on the season (.24 per set), and her offensive dominance in the 2016 season has notched her seventh in the Big West with 3.8 points per set.</p>\n<p>Hoffman’s 2.35 digs per set are an improvement of 1.52 from her mark in the previous season and of 0.42 over her first-year campaign. The defense from the outside makes Hoffman a consistent double-double threat, and her presence at the net to the tune of 0.54 blocks per set further contributes to her role as one of the league’s most all-around players.</p>\n<p>“The coaches really push us in the gym and in the weight room,” Hoffman said. “I’ve been helped by the athletic trainers especially to get back [physically].”</p>\n<p>Team chemistry has also helped Hoffman reach personal success.</p>\n<p>“We have a really good team dynamic,” Hoffman said. “All of the freshmen coming in have key roles on the team, and I’m really proud of them.”</p>\n<p>The team has focused heavily on creating that team dynamic this season. With all the young talent on the roster, creating team unity has proved its most valuable tool.</p>\n<p>“C3HD: commitment, confidence, communication, happiness, determination,” Hoffman said. “That’s really been our motto all season, and it’s really helped us.”</p>\n<p>With seven conference games left, the Gauchos are hoping to win out and claim a spot in the NCAA postseason. The young Gaucho squad has shown serious flashes, including taking the league leading Long Beach State 49ers to a fifth set this past weekend.</p>\n<p>“One of our goals is to win the Big West, and it’s still possible,” Hoffman declared. “We really want to get to the NCAA tournament, and I believe we can as long as we keep winning and keep this streak.”</p>\n<p>Whatever success the Gauchos are able to have toward the end of this season, it will be a direct cause of the consistent excellence and unity that Hoffman has helped foster. With the injury behind her, success is the only thing that lies ahead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 1 and continued on page 9 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73498\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73498\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/","id":1917,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1916,1915,1914],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Break Even in Conf.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>UCSB was paced on offense by junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman (team high 13 kills) and received important contributions from first-year middle blocker Rowan Ennis (nine kills), redshirt first-year Lindsey Ruddins (eight kills) and redshirt first-year Hannah Juley (23 assists).</p>\n<p>Juley has been dominant of the Gauchos of late, putting her teammates in perfect situations for kills. She remains fourth in Big West play with 10.50 assists per set but will face off against the most prolific setter in the conference, junior Taylor Nelson.</p>\n<p>Nelson has been a constant catalyst for success on this Cal Poly team, with 12.09 assists per set and almost 400 total in conference play. Last outing against the Gauchos, she recorded 36 assists in three sets of work, and will need to be limited if UCSB hopes to come away with a win this time around.</p>\n<p>The biggest beneficiary of Nelson’s hard work has been Raeann Greisen, whose 4.16 kills per set on a .334 kill percentage — only 35 total errors on 293 attacks — have made her the most efficient high volume scorer in the Big West throughout the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s defense relies heavily on the effort of sophomore libero Katherine Brouker. Her 14 digs were a team high last time out against the Gauchos, and she ranks fourth since conference play started with 4.25 digs per set.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, one of the two players she trails in digs over that span is UCSB sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi, who averages 4.59 digs per set. Petrachi also bested Brouker in digs in the first match between the teams, finishing with 15 on the evening.</p>\n<p>Gaucho senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt will participate in what could be her final match against Cal Poly after missing the first contest with the conference foes.</p>\n<p>Newcomer Lindsey Ruddins has also made a huge impact, especially considering that she’s returning from injury. In fact, the freshman just won conference freshman of the week for the fourth time this season, most of any first-year, after averaging 4.89 kills per set last weekend and acquiring a .330 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are pumped for this weekend as their recent play as well as the upcoming opponent are providing all the inspiration they need.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the matchup,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “Obviously, it’s a rivalry game, so it brings out a lot of excitement and energy from our team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to San Luis Obisbo on Friday, Oct. 28, and the teams will play at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73492\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73492\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/","id":5434,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5433,5432,5431],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB With Fourth Consecutive Split Result","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite taking the Big West's top team in the standings in Long Beach State to five sets, the UCSB women's volleyball team fell short of an upset and endured another loss CSUN to close out the weekend...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB women’s volleyball split its weekend matches for the fourth consecutive time, losing 3-2 Friday night to Long Beach State 21-25, 22-25, 25-15, 25-21 and 15-13.

The losing woes remained for the Matadors, who lost their sixth consecutive match to fall to 6-14 and 2-6.</p>\n<p>With the challenge of being in the middle of the pack within the Big West standings as the season nears its end, the Gauchos are facing dire circumstances as their postseason chances are on the line.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re trying to win out. We’re trying to get an opportunity to go in the postseason because I think we can really make a run,” said senior middle Elizabeth Sheffield. “We’ve had some pretty tough losses this season, but when we play the way we played tonight, we can do really well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to take the Big West leading Long Beach State 49ers to five sets, something that had happened just twice in conference play prior to Friday’s match. UCSB had not yet played a fifth set since beginning the conference schedule on Sept. 23.</p>\n<p>For the first time against a Big West opponent this season, Long Beach State found itself in a two-set hole early in the match.</p>\n<p>The match’s first set began with a furious back-and-forth; the score tied up 6 times before settling at only 10 apiece.</p>\n<p>After three straight errors for UCSB, first-year outside hitter Megan Rice notched three kills, junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman added a service ace and redshirt first-year outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins earned a kill of her own, taking what had been a three-point deficit and turning it into the first Gaucho lead since the set’s third point.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to successfully hold off the 49ers for the remainder of the set, though the pesky 49er squad would never trail by more than three until first-year defensive specialist Maxine Burke’s service ace gave the Gauchos a 25-21 win.</p>\n<p>Megan Rice and Lindsey Ruddins would again prove decisive characters in the second frame, with two kills each in UCSB’s first eight points of the set. First-year middle blocker Rowan Ennis would add a kill of her own, and two service aces early in the set from Lexi Rottman would aid an early 9-3 Gaucho lead.</p>\n<p>The 49ers would did their best to close the gap, but the Gauchos contained LBSU with an excellent offensive effort, out-hitting their opponent for the second consecutive set, this time .314 to .281.</p>\n<p>Sensing their backs against the wall, Long Beach came out firing in the third set, the most lopsided of the entire match and a decisive turning point in what had been UCSB’s night.</p>\n<p>UCSB was sloppy to say the least in the third, as they would produce their first eight-error set of the night, coincidentally <em>not </em>their last of the sort.</p>\n<p>Despite several errors early on, the Gauchos still fought to a 14-13 deficit, capped by a block from Rowan Ennis and Megan Rice.</p>\n<p>The train came off the tracks at that point, however, as a series of kills, including three from junior middle blocker Ashley Murray, and attack errors from UCSB would result in an 11-2 set-ending run for LBSU.</p>\n<p>The 49ers dominated the Gauchos in hitting percentage, racking up a .440 mark of their own while holding UCSB to a minuscule .000.</p>\n<p>After playing to an eight-point tie in the fourth, a five-point LBSU run would set the difference between the two teams for the majority of the set’s remainder. A late four-point run, including two kills from Lindsey Ruddins, would bring the Gauchos within three, but a kill from sophomore outside hitter Megan Kruidhof assisted by redshirt sophomore setter Missy Owens sent the teams to a fifth set.</p>\n<p>The tie-breaker was the closest set of the match, with neither team ever gaining more than a two-point lead.</p>\n<p>Kills from Chanel Hoffman and Lindsey Ruddins, accompanied by an attack error from senior outside hitter Nele Barber, put the Gauchos ahead 12-11, a victory against the Big West leaders seemingly within reach.</p>\n<p>LBSU’s resilient offense flexed its muscles once again, though, as Kruidhof killed two attacks, first-year libero Hailey Harward added another, and Nele Barber finished the job with a kill to give the 49ers a 15-13 set win, remaining unblemished on the season.</p>\n<p>Barber was the star of the evening, dominating with 22 kills on a .442 percentage, only three errors and 12 digs. She now stands at second in the conference with 4.17 kills per set in Big West play, and fifth with 4.23 digs per set over the same span.</p>\n<p>Missy Owens was yet again everywhere setting up her teammates, as her 45 assists added to her 11.37 assists per set against Big West competition, a mark that ranks second in the conference.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was back in early season form for the Gauchos, and her 25 kills (.361 kill percentage) were a match high. Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt also continued to improve after returning from injury, scoring 12 kills on 26 attempts (.308 percentage).</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi continued to lead her team on the defensive end with 16 digs, second in the match to LBSU’s Hailey Harward.</p>\n<p>The match showed the 49ers’ ability to come through in tough spots, as they continued their season-long winning streak in five-set matches, maintaining their storybook year and improving to 15-7 overall and 9-0 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Despite Friday’s heartbreaker, UCSB came out with a strong performance in its following match against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>A strong first set saw the Gauchos build a 24-16 lead, and despite a flurry of UCSB errors that got CSUN to 20 points, Megan Rice was able to finish the deal with a kill to seal the game.</p>\n<p>The Matadors were much more collected in the second set, playing the Gauchos to a series of ties before grabbing a 20-19 lead late. Two kills from Lindsey Ruddins as well as one from senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield would put the Gauchos up, and despite a short back-and-forth, they would hold the lead to gain a 2-0 set advantage.</p>\n<p>CSUN won a close third set 25-23, with no team ever gaining a large margin over the other. After blowing a 2-0 set lead on Friday, however, the Gauchos were not going to let another match slip between their fingers.</p>\n<p>The fourth set was UCSB’s best, as they produced a kill percentage of .407 on their way to a 25-17 win. A 6-1 run to start the set would prove to be the defining stretch; the cushion would be sufficient to suppress each Matador burst.</p>\n<p>Outside hitters Julie Haake (senior) and Aeryn Owens (sophomore) held down the offensive end for CSUN, with 22 and 16 kills respectively. Owens ranks fourth in Big West play with 4.03 kills per set, while Haake had one of her more impressive matches of the year as she normally averages 2.94 kills per set (14th in the conference).</p>\n<p>Owens added 15 digs, second on the team to junior libero Katie Sato, who accumulated 19 of her own. Junior setter Lauren Conati led the match with 48 assists and contributed a solid eight digs as well.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, Sheffield produced a career evening, with nine kills on 13 attempts for an über-efficient .615 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>“We needed more offense and Liz was outstanding coming in off the bench for us,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “She was pretty much unstoppable out of the middle.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley was the ultimate teammate, creating opportunities for her fellow Gauchos all over the court on her way to 47 assists. After 57 in the match against LBSU, she now sits at third in the Big West with 10.50 assists per set against conference opponents.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was again the offensive standout for UCSB, as her 19 kills led the team. She and Chanel Hoffman both rank in the top 10 for kills per set against the Big West, with 3.46 and 3.44 respectively.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have fairly consistently been able to beat teams around their record this season, while running into trouble against the more difficult competition.</p>\n<p>“It comes down to the little things,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted. “The discipline on defense, a little more effort in your own approach so the offense is cleaner. It’s remembering what’s working for you and resorting to the game plan, so it’s a lot of little things that combine to help you take that next step.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its postseason quest against division rival Cal Poly on Friday, Oct. 28 at 7 p.m. in its only match next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73452\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73452\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/","id":5433,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5432,5431,5430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Remain at T-Dome for the Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-4-web2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-4-web2.jpg?resize=681%2C467&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's volleyball team will look to win back-to-back conference games for the first time this season as it faces LBSU and CSUN.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team is looking forward to weekend matches against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge, facing both opponents for the second time this season.<br>\nThe Gauchos host the 49ers boasting a 12-8 overall record, 3-4 in conference after splitting a pair of Big West games for the second straight week.

\r\n</script> \n<p>The last matchup between the two squads stayed close at the start with the Gauchos dropping both opening sets 28-26 and 25-22.</p>\n<p>The 49ers would run away with the final set 25-18, however, though a sizable closing run would make what had been a close game a blowout.</p>\n<p>So far in conference play this season, LBSU senior outside hitter Nele Barber has been dominating the competition on her way to 4.00 kills per set.</p>\n<p>She is one of three players in the Big West to have totaled triple digits in total kills, trailing only Hawaii’s Nikki Taylor.</p>\n<p>Though Barber is the cause of most of the team’s overall production, middle blockers YiZhi Xue, a freshman, and junior Ashley Murray rank third and fourth, respectively, in the Big West for hitting percentage, as both have produced at a rate of .375 or higher in conference play.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore setter Missy Owens ranks second in Big West conference play with 11.65 assists per set, and she is the engine of what has been a productive LBSU offense to start the season.<br>\nOn defense, Barber has contributed further to her team’s success, digging 4.62 attacks per set in conference play.</p>\n<p>She’s accompanied by first-year defensive specialist and libero Hailey Harward who has averaged 4.42 digs per set in her first crack at Big West competition.</p>\n<p>The 49ers will be entering Friday evening on an especially hot streak having beat their top competition in the Big West, Hawaii, two weekends ago three sets to two, and having swept Cal State Northridge in their only match last weekend.</p>\n<p>CSUN hasn’t won since UCSB handed the team its first loss of the season on Sept. 30.</p>\n<p>Over that span, the team has only come away with three set wins in four matches, including consecutive sweeps at the hands of Hawaii and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>The Matadors sit at sixth in the conference with a 2-4 record, setting up an even match between them and the Gauchos Saturday night.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Aeryn Owens sets the tone for CSUN’s offense, and her team leading 3.84 kills per set in conference play places her fifth in the league.</p>\n<p>She receives a tremendous amount of help from junior setter Lauren Conati, whose 9.59 assists against the Big West also rank fifth in the conference.</p>\n<p>Junior libero and defensive specialist Katie Sato has been a menace on defense, and she’ll look to build on her 4.48 digs per set since the conference schedule began.</p>\n<p>She’s one of five players averaging over four digs in league play, and will do her best to prevent the Gauchos from finding any easy offensive looks.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman middle blocker Melissa Eaglin will attempt to do the same from the center of the court, as she is one of five players to average at least a block per set throughout the Big West schedule.<br>\nThe Gauchos are excited to build off their previous matches with both teams especially their first loss to Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“We played them really close in Long Beach. We were really without Phoebe completely, and Lindsey played just a little bit since it was her first match back after hardly practicing,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted. “Even with the team we had on the floor last time, we felt confident that if we had cleaned up a few things, [the match] would have gone a different way. Now we just have more strength.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins will look to regain her early season magic as she continues to get her feet back under her after an injury derailed her contributions early in the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman — eighth in Big West play with 3.64 kills per set — and freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis — fifteenth in conference play with 2.76 kills per set — will accompany Ruddins in a now fairly healthy Gaucho attack.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt will also be back after playing in some light action last weekend, and she, too, will hope to reproduce her early season dominance.</p>\n<p>The defense, as usual, will be centered around sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi who continues to lead the Big West in digs per set with 4.72 and total digs with 326.</p>\n<p>The libero also earned her second Big West Defensive Player of the Week Honors of the season after registering 49 digs in two matches last week against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to use its home court advantage to its full benefit in hopes of extending its one win over Cal State Fullerton last Saturday into a winning streak.</p>\n<p>The longest streak it has put together thus far this season is fives games, which occurred in the earlier portion of its schedule.</p>\n<p>When on the losing end of the spectrum, the Gauchos have not tended well, having been swept in six of their eight losses losses this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play Long Beach State at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 21, and Cal State Northridge at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 22, with both games being played at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>After beginning the second set in decent fashion, a 23-9 Riverside run gave the Highlanders an impenetrable cushion as they raced to a two-set lead.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders hit a resounding .435 in the set, while UCSB was only able to muster a measly .034 hitting percentage, combining only eight kills with seven errors.</p>\n<p>Errors were a problem for UCSB throughout the evening, as they totaled at least seven for each game, while Riverside stayed under that threshold in all but one set.</p>\n<p>Down two sets to none, the Gauchos were able to avoid a three-game sweep, winning 27-25 in the third.</p>\n<p>Midway through the set the Gauchos were able to gain a decent lead, 15-11, but a four-point run locked the two teams in a dead heat for the remainder of the game. After trading the lead back and forth, a trio of kills from redshirt freshman outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins and freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis put the Gauchos up one, 26-25.</p>\n<p>A service ace from sophomore setter Annie Hasselmann put the Gauchos over the top and gave them hope down 2-1 in the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasn’t able to carry the momentum to the next set, however, as they turned in their second-worst performance of the match, hitting .094 with eight errors.</p>\n<p>A five-point run started the set for UCR, with a stream of errors putting them in an early hole. Redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley began with a service error, followed by an attack error from Rowan Ennis and a bad set, again from Juley.</p>\n<p>After a pair of kills from sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle and freshman outside hitter Mickayla Sherman, a UCR lead of five would set the tone for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB would battle back to a 13-13 tie, but a 5-1 Highlander run would push the lead to 18-14, as they would maintain their distance from the Gauchos and capture the win.</p>\n<p>Freshman outside hitter Mickayla Sherman dominated the match Friday evening, scoring 28.5 points — more than double any UCSB player — and totaling a jaw-dropping 26 kills on 50 attacks. She was also one of four players to achieve at least 11 digs and added three block assists for good measure.</p>\n<p>Joining her in a suburb defensive effort were senior libero and defensive specialist Maddie Hubbell (18 digs), sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle (15 digs), senior outside hitter Cristina Maietta (15 digs) and junior middle blocker Meg Graham (three solo blocks, three assisted blocks).</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle kept things moving for the Highlanders. Her 45 assists were a match high, and she now stands at sixth in Big West conference play with 9.5 assists per set.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was productive for the Gauchos, totaling 13 kills and 11 digs, though her efficiency was subpar, with only a .174 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Matters weren’t much better for junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman, who, despite nine kills, 14 digs and two service aces, finished with a kill percentage of .086 on a night when her team couldn’t solve its opponent.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley continued her productive play with 35 assists, two assisted blocks and two service aces, and sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi again contributed a match-high in digs with 20.</p>\n<p>After losing its first two Saturday matches of the season, UCSB was able to pull out the second of its two contests this weekend, beating Cal State Fullerton 26-24, 21-25, 25-19, 25-20.</p>\n<p>The first set started extremely rocky for the Gauchos as they quickly found themselves in a deep 6-0 hole. The run included three kills from sophomore outside hitter Shimen Fayad, and all three were assisted by first-year setter Rachel Hall.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to slowly battle its way back, though, and a 9-2 stretch took the Gauchos from a four-point deficit to a 22-20 lead. Despite a short run from the Titans, UCSB was able to close the set, taking a 1-0 lead in the match.</p>\n<p>Again the Titans began the next set with an eye-popping run, starting the game 5-0 on kills by sophomore middle blocker Summer Kerins and Fayad, as well as a service ace and a bad set by UCSB’s Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>The match’s next point, a kill by UCSB freshman outside hitter Megan Rice, was the last time the Gauchos would be within four points of Cal State Fullerton for the entire second set.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were finally able to prevent a long Cal State run to start the third set, as the two teams stayed within two points of one another until a Devin Joos (sophomore outside hitter) kill on an assist from Hannah Juley gave UCSB a 20-17 lead.</p>\n<p>Joos’ attack came in the midst of an eight-point run for the Gauchos that essentially clinched the third set of the evening.</p>\n<p>UCSB and CSF were again closely matched in the final set, but a steady effort proved to be the deciding factor for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After going down 2-3 early in the set, the Gauchos wouldn’t trail again as they held the Titans to a .091 hitting percentage, slightly above their dismal percentage of .019 in the previous game.</p>\n<p>The UCSB offense put on a show as five different players — Rowan Ennis, Lindsey Ruddins, Devin Joos, Chanel Hoffman, and senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield — had kills in the final frame, helping the Gauchos capture their first win of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Emilia Petrachi had a season-high 29 digs, continuing her campaign as the league’s top defensive player. She received her second Big West Defensive Player of the Week award, and has been the centerpiece of a consistently feisty Gaucho defense.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley reached 50 assists in the match, as she too continues to maintain her team’s flow on offense and put her teammates where they need to be.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos didn’t dominate their opponents despite playing the two weakest Big West teams, but several solid signs shined through. They continue to play good defense with Petrachi leading the way, and UCSB always receives offensive contributions from the top to the bottom of the roster. Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt was also able to play some in the third set, an encouraging sign after missing the previous several matches due to injury.</p>\n<p>This UCSB team has many impressive pieces; it’s just a matter of those pieces coming together to create a greater sum than they have so far this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will next host Long Beach State on Friday, Oct. 21 and Cal State Northridge on Saturday, Oct. 22. Both Games will be at the UCSB Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73251\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73251\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-17/gauchos-split-another-pair-of-conference-matches/","id":5411,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5410,5409,5408],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope To Take Advantage of Faltering Competition","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With hopes of surpassing the .500 mark for its conference record, the UCSB women's volleyball team will look to capitalize upon this week's opponents UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.

Most notably, she has 22 service aces, a mark that ranks fifth in the Big West.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">After a 5-7 finish in their non-conference schedule, the Highlanders have lost each of their Big West matches. They were swept in dominant fashion by Hawaii and came up short against Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State and UC Irvine despite taking each to four sets.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">UCR will face Cal Poly on Saturday, and —with that being the first of two opportunities to reverse the disappointing start to its conference schedule — it is plausible that the Highlanders will be prepared and determined to earn victories as the underdogs.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">UCSB’s Saturday opponent, Cal State Fullerton, is coming off a loss to UC Davis that dropped the Titans’ record to 1-3 in conference play.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">The Titans boast a strong line of outside hitters, with five averaging more than a kill per set. Sophomores Shimen Fayad and Madeline Schneider lead the group with 3.42 and 3.17 kills per set respectively, forming a duo that the Gauchos will have to watch out for all Saturday evening.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">Fayad also cleans things up on defense for the Titans, as her team-high 197 digs leads both of the teams’ defensive specialists, though freshman libero Madisen Babich leads the team in digs per set with an average of 3.25 to Fayad’s 3.08.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">Freshman setter Rachel Hall leads the Titans with 500 assists on the season, averaging nearly eight per set at 7.94, followed by senior libero Precious Manu, who has registered a total of 166 assists and 5.72 per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">The Gauchos will attempt to build off their mixed weekend after again displaying flashes of the full potential that was expected to occur all year.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">After redshirt freshman outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins played in all three sets against Cal Poly, the team is hopeful she’ll be able to sustain her average of 4.12 kills per set — which ranks second in the conference — through the weekend.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman is not far behind her with 3.41 kills per set. Her performance thus far has been a steadying force for a team that has fluctuated between highs and lows this season.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">Moreover, redshirt freshman Hannah Juley has been one of the most productive setters in the league. She’ll look to improve her already stellar average of 9.84 assists per set closer to the double digits this weekend.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">UCSB’s libero, sophomore Emilia Petrachi, continues to reign supreme in the conference with 4.54 digs per set and ranks third in total digs at 277.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">The Gauchos have the pieces, the coaching and the attitude to still make some serious noise this weekend as they have consistently stuck with teams even in their losses.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">With two wavering opponents, UCSB will look to build some momentum in hopes of improving their record to above the .500 mark.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5938228481414269541gmail-Body\">The Gauchos will travel to Riverside this Friday, Oct. 14 to play the Highlanders at 7 p.m. at the SRC Arena. Their road trip will continue at Fullerton on Saturday, Oct. 15 to take on the Titans at 7 p.m. at Titan Gym.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73076\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73076\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/gauchos-hoping-to-take-advantage-of-faltering-opponents-in-ucr-csuf/","id":5413,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5412,5411,5410],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Capitalizes Against UC Davis, Falls Flat vs. Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball-DustinHarris-100616-IMG_0028-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball-DustinHarris-100616-IMG_0028-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After picking up its second conference win against UC Davis on Friday, UCSB was unable to even take a set from its green rival Cal Poly Sunday night in a tough loss.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB women’s volleyball split a pair of home matches this past weekend, defeating UC Davis in a close contest 25-23, 21-15, 25-20, 28-26 and falling to Cal Poly in straight sets 25-23, 25-21, 25-16.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match was a grueling affair, as both teams put forth tremendous efforts, leaving everything on the court.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73006\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73006\" data-attachment-id=\"73006\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/ucsb-capitalizes-against-uc-davis-falls-flat-vs-cal-poly/sydney-bast-sends-the-ball-over-the-net-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball-DustinHarris-100616-IMG_0028-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sydney Bast sends the ball over the net.

At 16-11, however, the Gauchos put up four straight and the teams were separated by one point until the set’s concluding score.</p>\n<p>After going up 12-11 in the second, UCSB fell victim to a Davis eruption, as six different players scored seven points to put the Gauchos in an 18-12 hole.</p>\n<p>Two Davis attack errors and a kill by senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield gave the Gauchos a whiff of hope in the set, but UCD was able to stall the comeback and tie the match at one game apiece.</p>\n<p>The third set saw the two team’s barbs early on, with UCSB taking the lead halfway through the game.</p>\n<p>A trio of kills by freshman outside hitter Megan Rice, freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis and junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman, all of which were assisted by redshirt freshman Hannah Juley, coupled with a series of UCD attack errors, put the Gauchos on a 7-2 run, that ended up being the deciding stretch of the set.</p>\n<p>With UCSB up 2-1, the final set was without a doubt the most exhausting of the four.</p>\n<p>Neither team could gain much high ground early on as Davis and Santa Barbara both took the lead on several occasions.</p>\n<p>Down 14-15, the Gauchos benefited from four UCD errors and a Chanel Hoffman kill to gain a four point lead, 19-15. UCSB would hold that lead until two kills and a service ace from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom gave the Aggies a game-point opportunity at 25-24.</p>\n<p>After trading scores, Elizabeth Sheffield’s kill tied the set at 26, and she and Chanel Hoffman blocked an attack attempt from Davis’ sophomore outside hitter Emily Allen to give the Gauchos a one-point lead.</p>\n<p>Allen would slip up again, as her attack error on the next point would give the Gauchos a victory in their first match of the weekend, and propel them to 2-2 overall in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Aggies had six players with double-digit points, paced by junior middle blocker Aima Eichie with 12 kills and 13.5 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB was in the lead in points and kills by Chanel Hoffman with 17 and 15 respectively, and Hannah Juley was everywhere with 43 assists and 11 digs. Elizabeth Sheffield and Rowan Ennis were also vital to the Gauchos, scoring with 9 and 12 kills apiece, while defensive specialists sophomore Emilia Petrachi and redshirt sophomore Sydney Bast combined for 27 digs to prop up the defense.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s matchup with Cal Poly featured more of the Gauchos’ bugaboos, as they were swept for the third time in conference play.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly bested UCSB in hitting percentage in each of the three sets, reaching a wild level of efficiency with a .419 mark in the final game.</p>\n<p>The match’s first set was as close as it gets, with both teams scoring in decisive outbursts. Cal Poly scored three straight early, only for UCSB to go on a 9-3 run.</p>\n<p>The two squads were within one or two points for the majority of the match, and after a back-and-forth sequence brought the score to 24-23 Cal Poly, a devastating block from sophomore outside hitter Adlee Van Winden and senior middle blocker Taylor Gruenewald on Rowan Ennis gave the Mustangs a one-set lead.</p>\n<p>Three Cal Poly kills again opened the next set, though the Mustangs had a much easier time maintaining their lead the second time around.</p>\n<p>UCSB was held at a distance throughout the set, and despite a late run, including a kill by redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins that brought the Gauchos within two, successful attacks from Van Winden and junior outside hitter Raeann Greisen put the Mustangs up 2-0.</p>\n<p>An early six-point run in the third set gave the Mustangs a 9-3 lead they wouldn’t relinquish for the remainder of the evening, as they played their best set of the match.</p>\n<p>Greisen (.423 hitting percentage) and Van Winden (13 kills, 11 digs) were the offensive fulcrums for Cal Poly, while sophomore libero Katherine Brouker contributed heavily on the defensive end with 14 digs of her own.</p>\n<p>Chanel Hoffman (13 kills), Rowan Ennis (nine kills, two assisted blocks) and Lindsey Ruddins (eight kills, .333 hitting percentage) all performed well for the Gauchos, as Ruddins at least was able to play in all three sets after seeing time in only two of the four on Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB sits at fourth in the Big West, tied with UC Davis and CSUN with a 2-3 conference record.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will hit the road this weekend for a Friday match at UC Riverside and a Saturday match at Cal State Fullerton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Throughout the entire season thus far, they’ve received over two kills per set from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom and freshman outside hitter Lauren Matias, as well as over three per set from senior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">The Aggies are led in scoring by sophomore outside hitter Emily Allen, who paces her team with 3.73 kills per set and a robust 220 kills so far in the season. She’s also added 2.68 digs per set, contributing to UCD’s 16.12 overall season mark, good for second in the conference.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">That impressive defense is led by redshirt freshman setter and defensive specialist Heather Reed, who has supplied 4.66 digs per set along with only 23 receiving errors in a whopping 443 attempts (.948).</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">Around the net, UCSB will have to navigate sophomore middle blocker Kelechi Ohiri who leads the Big West with 1.34 blocks per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">After Thursday’s tilt, the Gauchos will have a day off before Cal Poly arrives for a Saturday night showdown. The Mustangs won both matches between the teams last year, and UCSB will be hungry to wrestle the momentary crown from their central coast rivals.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">The Mustangs receive the bulk of their offensive effort from senior middle blocker Taylor Gruenewald (2.38 kills per set), sophomore outside hitter Alexis Clewis (2.87 k/s), junior outside hitter Raeann Greisen (3.13 k/s) and sophomore outside hitter Adlee Van Winden (3.45 k/s).</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">All four rank in the top 20 of the Big West for the statistic, and the Gauchos will have to be keenly focused to deter the Cal Poly attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">Junior setter Taylor Nelson is the main catalyst for the Mustangs, racking up 11.25 assists per set, best in the Big West, along with 2.36 digs per set on the season. Nelson is aided on the defensive end by sophomore libero Katherine Brouker, who leads the team with 3.95 digs per set.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">Wins in both games would put the Gauchos right back in the driver’s seat behind Hawaii and Long Beach State in the conference hierarchy. UC Davis and Cal Poly will provide quite a challenge, though, and the Gaucho squad knows a lot will be thrown their way.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">“We’re going to see some different looks,” Lantagne Welch said, leading up to the weekend’s slate of games. “We’re trying to clean up our side of the ball offensively and make sure our first contact is where it needs to be.”</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">UCSB certainly has some key assets on its side that can help them attain two huge Big West wins. One of them is, of course, outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins. The redshirt freshman leads the team in kills per set with 4.33, second best in the conference. This season, Ruddins has earned Big West Freshman of the Week three consecutive weeks in a row.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt has been solid this season as well, serving as a dual threat for the Gauchos. Currently, she is first in the conference in hitting percentage at .394, as well as fifth in blocks per set with 0.98.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">On the defensive side, libero Emilia Petrachi has been an absolute force for Santa Barbara this season. The sophomore recently earned the Big West Defensive Player of the Week for the second time in her career this week, first of the season, after averaging 5.43 digs per set this weekend.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">This season, Petrachi has been one of the best in the Big West as she ranks second and fourth with 4.56 digs per set and 246 total digs, respectively. She leads the team in both categories.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">The inward focus has defined this Gaucho team all season, and they will rely on their evolving take-care-of-business mentality to boost them against Davis and Cal Poly.</p>\n<p class=\"m_5245315850548032733gmail-Body\">UCSB will host the Aggies at 7 p.m. on Thursday and the Mustangs at 7 p.m. Saturday evening. Both games will be held in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Down 9-12, UCSB scored six straight points, forcing a CSUN timeout and creating what would be an insurmountable lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gaucho offense was propelled by freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis, senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt and junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman. They each reached double digits in kills, while all hitting over .340, setting the tone for a ferocious UCSB attack. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN’s standout sophomore outside hitter Aery Owens continued her scoring prowess, averaging four kills per set and amassing a team high of 16 total. Her efficiency was down, however, as Owens was only able to put forth a modest .159 hitting percentage, and she was plagued by errors with nine, a match high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also contributing to the scoring frenzy was the Matadors’ redshirt freshman middle blocker Melissa Eaglin, who amassed 10 kills on a .429 hitting percentage, and scored 14.5 points, second on her team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively, the Gauchos relied on sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi’s 22 digs, as well as Phoebe Grunt’s two solo blocks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For CSUN, junior libero and defensive specialist Katie Sato dug 21 attacks, second highest in the match, and sophomore defensive specialist Erin Indermill added 15 of her own. The going was tough in the middle for the Gauchos, as Owens and Eaglin contributed to four and seven assisted blocks, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach State would not prove as easy an opponent for the Gauchos, however, as they were swept for the fourth time in six matches and the second time by a conference opponent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first set was the match’s closest, as the opponents traded jabs back and forth before two kills and an attack error gave LBSU a 28-26 win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second set, the Gauchos again kept it close, but after reaching an 8-8 tie, UCSB was held at an arm’s length of two or three points for the remainder of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final set of the match saw UCSB grab an early lead, though the eight-point mark again proved to be a line of demarcation as Long Beach grabbed control of the game, scoring four straight points. A 7-2 run would end the match, as the Gauchos seemed exhausted from the relentless LBSU attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loss came despite Chanel Hoffman’s career evening, totaling a career best 19 kills in the match.

This time around, the Gauchos will be keenly focused on capitalizing on their opportunities and regaining a positive record.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face CSUN this Friday, Sept. 30, at 7 p.m. and will travel to play Long Beach State Saturday, Oct. 1, at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Remarkably, that was the lowest percentage Hawaii would hit for the entire match, as they improved above .400 for the next two sets.</p>\n<p>Hawaii provided another gut punch in the second set, as a dominant performance coupled with a sloppy UCSB showing (eight errors) led the Rainbow Wahine to their most decisive victory of the three games, 25-14.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s hitting percentage actually dropped to .000 while the Wahine jumped to .407, accurately portraying the chasm between the two teams’ second-set performances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to put forth a strong final set, however, finally raising their hitting percentage to a serviceable .241 and amassing double-digit kills (13).</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s vastly improved effort, the 14th-ranked Hawaii squad improved for the third consecutive game, playing a virtually perfect final set on their way to a 25-19 victory.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine boasted a hitting percentage of .448, committed only one error, and each time the Gauchos clawed their way back into contention, Hawaii was poised with a run of its own.</p>\n<p>This impressive Hawaii team refined its attack throughout the evening, asserting itself again as the Big West’s goliath.</p>\n<p>They received important contributions from across the roster, with senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor, sophomore outside hitter McKenna Granato, sophomore outside hitter Casey Castillo and reserve senior middle hitter Annie Mitchem leading the team’s offensive wave.</p>\n<p>Each of the four totaled at least seven kills, with Granato leading the pack with 13. Granato and her teammate Castillo hit a resounding .478 and .667 respectively, marking the efficiency with which the Wahine attacked the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>McKenna Granato also collected seven digs, second on the team to first-year setter Norene Iosia (8), adding to her solid all-around performance. Nikki Taylor had four assisted blocks to go along with one solo, further contributing to Hawaii’s stellar defense.</p>\n<p>Despite the disappointing output, several Gauchos still maintained a high level of play.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman amassed 10 kills, and despite her hitting percentage of .200, she was the only Gaucho with double-digit points in the match.</p>\n<p>Coach Lantagne Welch saw several positives throughout the evening that should help the team during the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>“Chloe Allen came off the bench, followed the game plan and went after it. She had success and that was a boost for us,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted of her first-year outside hitter.</p>\n<p>Allen has settled into her role off the bench, garnering the respect of her team and providing the Gauchos with verve in reserve heavy units.</p>\n<p>During the final game, Lantagne Welch was impressed with another first-year, middle blocker Rowan Ennis: “[She] got hot there for a stretch and helped us in the third set.” Ennis’ three kills in the set were vital in keeping the Gauchos within reach of a victory in the final game.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore and defensive specialist Sydney Bast also caught her coach’s eye, as she “helped stabilize [UCSB’s] passing,” while digging a team-high nine attacks.</p>\n<p>When Bast was asked after the game what about the Hawaii team had stumped the Gauchos, she noted, “they have a fast offense and we knew it coming into this game. We prepared for it all week, we just didn’t execute like we wanted to.”</p>\n<p>She made sure to mention, though, the team’s consistently positive outlook: “It’s all good. We’re going to get them back at Hawaii.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look for its first conference win against Cal State Northridge on Friday, Sept. 30 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/","id":5025,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5024,5023,5022],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/292"}},"__N_SSG":true}
