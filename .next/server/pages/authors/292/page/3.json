","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Prior to being shut out by the University of San Diego in its last match, the UCSB women’s volleyball team had won four of its last five games. After a mid-week practice leading up to Friday’s Big West Conference opening match vs No. 14 Hawaii, Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch was optimistic while explaining what had impressed her most throughout the team’s first few weeks of non-conference play.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of potential.

\r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB played in four tournaments, finishing with a winning record in three of them and swept six of its opponents.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s offense has been spearheaded by its outside hitters, led by redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins and junior Chanel Hoffman. Ruddins has picked up Big West Freshman of the Week honors for three consecutive weeks after earning three straight all-tournament team honors and leads the team with 196 kills at an average of 4.45 kills per set.</p>\n<p>Hoffman boasts the second most kills on the team with 137, providing the Gauchos with a dominant one-two punch on the outside that opponents have struggle to answer against.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt seems to be on her way to an All-Big West team after earning an Honorable Mention the past two years. She is averaging a team-high .95 blocks per set, providing the Gauchos with a force in the middle that has been essential to their early season success.</p>\n<p>“Phoebe has been the most consistent for us,” Lantagne Welch explained before noting her .410 hitting percentage during the non-conference schedule to lead all Big West players. For her fourth straight season, she’s providing UCSB with excellent all-around play, and, with this young team, her leadership has never been more vital.</p>\n<p>The UCSB defense has been propped up by sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi who is one of two Big West players to amass over 200 digs in non-conference play. She’s been seemingly everywhere on the court, and the Gauchos will be relying on her prowess when facing the talent within the Big West.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will be on the road for the first time this season as it played all 11 of its non-conference matches at home in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p>With a 7-4 record, the Rainbow Wahine are 14th in the national Division I rankings and will be one of the toughest teams the Gauchos have faced so far.</p>\n<p>After missing the first three matches of the season, senior outside hitter and last year’s Big West Player of the Year Nikki Taylor leads the Big West with 5.41 kills per set, almost a full kill more than Ruddins, who holds second place by a sizable margin.</p>\n<p>Junior libero and defensive specialist Savanah Kahakai is third in the Big West with 4.40 digs per set, only slightly behind Petrachi, and she’s sure to make things difficult for the Gaucho offense throughout the match.</p>\n<p>Junior middle hitter Emily Maglio will only make matters more difficult for UCSB as her 1.25 blocks per set rank second in the conference, not to mention her jarring .390 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>The veteran laden Rainbow Wahine will provide an important test for the Gauchos to open conference play as Coach Lantagne Welch mentioned UCSB’s tendency to “make rookie mistakes” in certain situations.</p>\n<p>“The big thing is, if we take care of our side and [ride] out at a really high percentage, we’re going to be in a good situation,” Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>Thus far, it has been an exciting season for the Gauchos who have showed that youth doesn’t always need time to mature before success. A visit from the 2015 Big West champions will provide a true test for the young squad who finished a modest 3-13 in conference play last season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos certainly think they belong, however, and Lantagne Welch is fully committed to ensuring that she and her team believe they are capable.</p>\n<p>“We do have some goals; we want to go after this Big West championship,” Lantagne Welch said. “[Most importantly], focusing on what we can do this day and focus[ing] on our next match.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and Hawaii will face off on Friday, Sept. 23 at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of September 22, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72520\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72520\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/","id":5019,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5018,5017,5016],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sweep Through USF Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is off to its best start since 2009 after winning the USF tournament in which newcomer Lindsey Ruddins shined and was named MVP.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After impressive performances in the season’s two opening weekends resulted in a rock solid 5-2 start, this UCSB team still appears to have room to improve as the season continues.</p>\n<p>Traveling to USF for the San Francisco Challenge, the Gauchos swept their three matches against Brown, Saint John’s and the hosting university, losing only one set over the two days.</p>\n<p>In their first match, UCSB controlled each game, winning 25-18, 25-11 and 25-21.

UCSB’s outside hitters were outstanding, with redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins contributing seven kills, freshman Megan Rice adding six and junior Chanel Hoffman rounding out the unit with five more.</p>\n<p>Freshman Charlie Robinson and senior Phoebe Grunt were also tremendous for the Gauchos at middle blocker; Robinson had six kills on 11 attempts, good for a team-best .545 kill percentage, and Grunt’s 10.5 points were good for second highest for the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB hit a much higher percentage than Brown throughout the match, staying over .300 for all three games, and topping .400 in the first frame. Though the Bears hit .368 to open the match, the team followed with a dismal second set including 10 errors on the way to a -.143 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Brown’s junior libero and defensive specialist Melissa Cairo impressed on defense, securing more digs (10) than any other player in the match, and sophomore hitter Sabrina Stillwell still managed to come away with seven kills.</p>\n<p>The second match was UCSB’s closest of the day, as an undefeated St. John’s team came out fast with a 25-16 win in the opening set.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hit a poor .088 compared to the Red Storm’s .360 and committed nine errors to St. John’s one, leading to a mess of a first game for UCSB.</p>\n<p>They would come back to win the next three sets 25-22, 25-22 and 25-23 on the back of a match-high 20 kills from Lindsey Ruddins, who continues to rack up points for the Gaucho offense. Her dominant performance was paired with sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi’s, who carried the UCSB defense with 16 digs, also tops for the contest.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to best St. John’s in hitting percentage for the remainder of the match, accumulating 16 and 15 kills in the final two sets.</p>\n<p>Each of the games were close with both teams trading impressive runs throughout the entire match, easily UCSB’s most difficult in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>St. John’s was led by strong efforts from their outside hitters, sophomore Margherita Bianchin and freshman Gaia Traballi, who amassed 14 and 12 kills respectively. Junior middle blocker Julia Cast and senior outside hitter Mona Karkkainen, both of whom also spend time at opposite hitter, turned in important performances as they were the third and fourth players on St. Johns to have double digit points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished Saturday’s double header strong, beating the host USF in straight sets 26-24, 25-12 and 25-15.</p>\n<p>Starting quickly was again an issue for the Gauchos, as a back and forth game appeared almost out of reach after falling behind 24-21. UCSB would fight back several set points, however, as a calm approach allowed them to maintain their focus and stave off their second lost game of the day.</p>\n<p>UCSB still held a strong advantage over the Dons in kill percentage in the first set, suggesting the gap between the two teams may have been wider than the score suggested. Such a hypothesis was strongly supported throughout the final two frames, with the Gauchos dominating the second set on the back of a game-winning 12-5 run and a staggering .688 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>The final set started with a 6-1 Gaucho run, and another six-point burst would all but seal the game and end the match.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins and Chanel Hoffman were again offensive centerpieces for UCSB, each totaling double-digit points, while Emilia Petrachi turned in another day’s work with 15 digs.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley and sophomore defensive specialist Lexi Rottman added 8 and 7 digs respectively, completing a great defensive effort from the Gauchos which saw the Dons finish with hitting percentages of -.043 and .057 in the final games.</p>\n<p>USF’s outside hitters played a solid game, with freshman Tyna Adamcikova providing 13 points and senior Emily Reed adding nine of her own.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was named the tournament’s most outstanding player with 38 kills and was joined on the all-tournament team by teammate Phoebe Grunt.</p>\n<p>This was Ruddins’s third time in as many opportunities this season making the all-tournament team, as well as her third time being awarded the Big West Freshman of the Week. Ruddins was nominated for the Player of the Week as well, and with her dominant play it would not be a surprise to see her take home that acknowledgment sooner than later.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos sit atop the Big West at 8-2 and will travel next to San Diego where they will participate in the California Mixer with San Diego State, San Jose State and USD on September 16 and 17.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72430\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72430\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/","id":5018,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5017,5016,5015],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Two Out of Three on Opening Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_004.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_004.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos started the season off the right way winning two of their three matches on the first weekend of action.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team started the season in impressive fashion over the final weekend in August, collecting two wins in three matches.

After an attack error by UNLV redshirt sophomore outside hitter Caitlin Wernentin put UCSB up 27-26, an attack error by UCSB junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman, followed by kills from UNLV senior outside hitter Alyssa Wing and sophomore middle blocker Elsa Descamps, sealed the set for the Rebels.</p>\n<p>UNLV controlled the second set 25-16, dominating the Gauchos in hitting percentage .400 to .182 after both teams hit around .275 in the first set. UNLV held second set advantages of three in both errors and kills, and a five-point run, pushing the lead from 15-13 to 20-13, all but sealed the Gauchos fate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB played well in the final frame, however, as the game was tied 25-25 before kills by redshirt senior middle blocker Bree Hammel and senior outside hitter Elisa Woinowsky, both of which were assisted by junior setter Alexis Patterson, propelled UNLV over the enduring Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins, an outside hitter, stood out for the Santa Barbara squad.  She led the match in points with 16.5, edging out UNLV’s Bree Hammel by a point and a half. Ruddins had a whopping 46 total attacks, 15 more than Hammel and 17 more than Alyssa Wing, the match’s second and third most active attackers.</p>\n<p>A disheartening first match didn’t deter the Gauchos from a successful day, as the following contest against New Mexico State was an absolute thriller. Lasting five games, the match saw UCSB battle back from two sets down, once again on the back of Lindsey Ruddins and her match-high 26 points.</p>\n<p>The Aggies took the first two sets 30-28 and 25-22 before the Gauchos stormed back, winning the next three sets 25-23, 25-19 and 15-13.</p>\n<p>Ruddins repeated her performance as the match’s most valuable player with 65 attacks and 24 kills, both match highs. Chanel Hoffman, senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt and freshman middle blocker Charlie Robinson each added double digit points for the Gauchos, and Grunt and freshman middle blocker/opposite hitter Rowan Ennis contributed impressive hitting percentages of .316 and .471 respectively.</p>\n<p>After reaching a 14-14 draw midway through the fourth set, the Gauchos ended the game with an 11-5 run, giving the team a boost of momentum heading into the tie-breaker. The final game was close, but UCSB again pulled away at the end, sealing their first victory of the day on a Ruddins kill, assisted by redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>The Aggies received important contributions from across the roster, including junior outside hitter Jordan Abalos, sophomore outside hitter Tatyana Battle, junior middle hitter Sasha-Lee Thomas, and junior outside hitter Kassandra Tohm. Each of the four totaled at least 16 kills as the Gauchos faced a relentless effort all evening from the NMSU hitters.</p>\n<p>In their final match of the day, the Gauchos sent Albany to 0-3 on the weekend, with sets of 27-25, 23-25, 25-23 and 25-21.</p>\n<p>The Great Danes kept it close with a spirited performance from sophomore libero Nicole Otero, who amassed 27 digs — 10 more than any other player in the contest — and a balanced attack, with four players finishing with double-digit points.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense proved too much for Albany, however, as Ruddins continued her stellar performance and completed her third game of the Invitational in which she led all players in points, attacks, and kills. The redshirt first-year was a revelation in her first weekend of the 2016 season, and after an injury-marred 2015, Ruddins appears to be on pace for a dominant season leading the Gauchos offense.</p>\n<p>Phoebe Grunt also contributed 17 kills in the final match — second only to Ruddins — completing a solid weekend of her own. Sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi was vital to the Gaucho’s solid defense over the weekend, amassing a staggering 64 digs and leading all players in the first two matches with 25 and 27 digs respectively.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play next at the UCSB Tournament over Labor Day weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With Hill and Exum receiving most of the playing time at the point, the Jazz will now offer 48 minutes of impactful defense at the spot where they started Raul Neto and Shelvin Mack, mixed with a heavy dosage of Trey Burke, in 2015-16.</p>\n<p>Though Neto and Mack weren’t awful on that end, there’s no doubt that Hill and Exum will be a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Signing Joe Johnson for two years and $22 million is perfect for a young team in need of veteran leadership and shooting, both of which Johnson offers in spades. Some secondary and tertiary play initiation will be helpful for bench-heavy units, and Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors will easily mask his defensive deficiencies at the rim.</p>\n<p>Pair him with Boris Diaw (acquired from the Spurs in a move to clear space), familiar with Gobert from their time on the French national team, and the youthful team has two old heads to navigate the Jazz to a playoff return at relatively low cost.</p>\n<p>The Jazz will struggle to keep up with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on the perimeter, there’s no doubt, but dominating the Warriors on the boards and scaring them away from the rim has proved a decent tactic in the past.</p>\n<p>The Warriors kryptonite might be a more switch everything approach, with big guards capable of hounding Durant or Draymond Green in short stretches, or it might not exist at all, but the Jazz have added steady contributors to a roster already fairly well-suited to establish itself among the Western Conference elites, and as the Warriors’ toughest competition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>7 Seconds or Less Comes to Houston</em></strong><em> </em></p>\n<p>The Rockets were a massive disappointment last season after many picked them as the second or third best team in the Western Conference.

Gordon will presumably come off the bench, though it wouldn’t be shocking to see D’Antoni start James Harden as his point guard next season. He’s a better offensive player than Beverley, more versatile and a better shooter, and D’Antoni has proven a strong defensive unit is not his priority.</p>\n<p>Ryan Anderson has the shooting that both Morey and D’Antoni crave at the power forward position, but back injuries have left his future in question. Anderson earning $21 million in his age 28 season is concerning, as the success of the contract will be totally reliant on his ability to stay healthy. He will open the paint for the Harden, Clint Capela pick-and-roll, a play with deadly potential on a spaced floor.</p>\n<p>The question for both Anderson and Gordon, teammates for the past few seasons in New Orleans, is whether or not they can contribute to a competent defense. The Rockets’ offense should be a joy to watch, but it’s not assured that Houston, juiced up on D’Antoni, will have a defense strong enough to stay much above 500. Harden should lead the team back to the playoffs, but a top-five seed seems like a stretch.</p>\n<p>Capela should be in store for a dominant breakout season; a talented rim runner, he has the perfect skill set to run the type of offense Dwight Howard stalled in his time as a Rocket. He’ll set strong screens for Harden, and has a knack for finishing inside, shooting over 66 percent at the rim in both of his first two NBA seasons.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71982\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71982\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/","id":3319,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3318,3317,3316],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rebuilt Teams Look to Contend for Eastern Crown","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nets.celtics.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nets.celtics.png?resize=635%2C322&ssl=1","description":"Most NBA analysts believe that Cleveland is all but guaranteed to repeat as Eastern Conference Champs, however, Staff Writer Liam Bailey discusses the possibility of two teams posing a threat thanks t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img data-attachment-id=\"66614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/flip-minnesotas-hometown-hero/around-the-nba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"around the nba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-66614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=746%2C155\" alt=\"around the nba\" width=\"746\" height=\"155\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>With Cleveland keeping most of their team in tact it seems as though dominating the East will be a forgone conclusion yet again this season and what awaits us is yet another Warriors-Cavs NBA Finals matchup, barring any massive injuries.

Marks added a lottery ticket at the shooting guard position in Caris LeVert, who showed the ability to score in bunches in his four years at Michigan.</p>\n<p>Though the lower body injuries that cut short his final two seasons are a concern, LeVert shot over 40 percent from three on over four attempts per game from his sophomore season onward.</p>\n<p>That shooting ability was paralleled by improvements in each of his four years in assists per game and assist percentage (an estimate of the number of teammate field goals assisted by a player while on the floor), the latter reaching 33 percent in his final season.</p>\n<p>With Rondae Hollis-Jefferson establishing himself as a defensive menace and an athletic marvel in his rookie campaign, the Nets are in need of someone at either the shooting guard or small forward to make up for his poor offensive game outside the paint.</p>\n<p>Enter LeVert, who should be able to grow with Hollis-Jefferson, cover up his shooting woes and allow the Arizona product to work off-ball cuts to his preferred areas more often as a result of potentially advanced playmaking at both guard positions.</p>\n<p>With the Boston Celtics receiving their first round pick in each of the next two seasons, adding LeVert gave the team another possible young building block.</p>\n<p>Speaking of guards, Sean Marks was able to acquire Jeremy Lin on a steal of a contract at three years, $36 million.</p>\n<p>Possibly eager to reunite with new the Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, a developmental wizard who was an assistant with the Knicks during Lin’s initial breakout, Lin took what seemed below his market value at an average of $12 million per season. Maybe the Nets were the only ones offering a starting job, but getting Lin for the next three years will give the Nets a competent starting point guard who could easily shift to a backup role if need be.</p>\n<p>Lin has shown the ability, both in Los Angeles and in Charlotte last year, to run an excellent pick-and-roll, with the speed to get downhill into the paint quickly and a strong shooting stroke both off the dribble and catch. He isn’t starting for a championship contender, but he fills the biggest hole on the Nets’ roster and gives them a reliable go-to play with a Brook-Lin pick-and-roll that will be difficult to stop in the regular season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71975\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71975\" data-attachment-id=\"71975\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/img25367215/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img25367215\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71975\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?resize=311%2C194\" alt=\"Jeremy Lin averaged 11.7 ppg coming off the bench in Charlotte last season.

Tyler Johnson and Allen Crabbe both received huge paydays with four-year contracts for $50 and $75 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Though both offers were matched by Miami and Portland respectively, the two bloated contracts will limit the future possibilities for both franchises. In Miami, Johnson’s contract will count for just under $6 million against the cap during his first two seasons, before tripling in cost for the final two.</p>\n<p>Though Miami hopes it can hit big on free agency during those first two years, paying Johnson, Whiteside and Goran Dragic close to $70 million in 2019-20 will constrict those desires.</p>\n<p>Crabbe will earn around $18 million per season, slightly more than the recently signed Evan Turner. Crabb is probably best served as a backup shooting guard, playing alongside either Lillard or McCollum while the other rests, though this is a ton of money for that service.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the Blazers have over $45 million invested in two players who harbor sufficient liabilities (defense for Crabbe, lack of outside shooting for Turner) to make both best suited for reserve roles.</p>\n<p>The Blazers hold few options moving forward, and with an extension for CJ McCollum uprising, they will likely be stuck with some iteration of this roster for the foreseeable future. Thanks to Marks’ aggressive moves, the Nets hamstrung two of the more dangerous teams in the league; Portland fresh off an impressive showing against the Warriors, and the Heat who are always a threat for a league-altering splash.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>The Celtics Get Their Man</em></strong></p>\n<p>Boston was finally able to lure a free agent to what has been a malaise of mediocre young talent and promises of a not-so-distant contender. Constantly propped up by the coaching of Brad Stevens, this odd collection of players was able to cobble together 48 wins in 2015-16, but clearly needed more offensive firepower apart from Isaiah Thomas in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Al Horford should perfectly complement this team, and vice versa; Jae Crowder will be an upgrade defensively from anyone who played small forward recently for the Hawks, likewise for Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart as point-of-attack stoppers who far exceed Dennis Schröder and Jeff Teague in that capacity.’</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71976\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71976\" data-attachment-id=\"71976\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"630,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71976\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Al Horford started all 82 games last season for the Hawks averaging 15.2 points per game and 7.3 rebounds per game.

Kelly Olynyk and Jonas Jerebko are also far superior three-point shooters to Millsap, offering Horford more space to operate during their shared time on the court.</p>\n<p>In the draft, the team reached for Jaylen Brown, impressed with his athleticism, ability to drive to the rim and seemingly high character. Though Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn and even Jamal Murray offered a higher floor than Brown, who held some of the worst statistical translations for such a high pick in recent history (Kevin Pelton), none shared Brown’s hydra-like ceiling on the wing, able to tenaciously defend four positions and get to the rack at will.</p>\n<p>The Cal product certainly struggles to fulfill that potential, however, as defensively his body is far more NBA-ready than his mind, and on the offensive end, his impressive drives end with missed lay-ups more often than made ones, and his passing ability is inconsistent. The flashes of a great player are there, and the Celtics are certainly a team with the flexibility to bring him along slowly, but it’s not difficult to see his career being a substantial disappointment.</p>\n<p>Ainge spent his next-to-first rounders on Guerschon Yabusele, a 20-year-old power forward from France who looked like an absolute tank in summer league and may come over this season, and Ante Zizic, a 19-year-old Croation center with vociferous energy who will stay abroad for at least one more year. Yabusele offers physicality and playmaking in a 270-pound package, and though he’ll require a ton of coaching on defense, it’s easy to picture him making a contribution in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The young supporting cast is perfect for Horford, as his post-30 career will be aided by a roster that mostly shares a positive age curve. Boston is still in need of another star, and for either Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown or one of the other draftees to show some serious juice.</p>\n<p>In an offseason where Celtics established themselves in the wrung below the Cavaliers out East, however, the move is a welcomed development for a franchise that was treading water, and can now consider itself a conference finals contender.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71968\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71968\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/","id":3320,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3319,3318,3317],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2016 NBA Mock Draft","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nba-draft-16.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nba-draft-16.jpg?resize=980%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Prepared to tip-off this evening, the 2016 NBA Draft entail an abundance of talented prospects looking to excel at the next level.

The Los Angeles Lakers also kept their pick, avoiding the potential disaster of two teams jumping them in the lottery, a scenario with a probability just under 45 percent, in which case they would’ve had to sacrifice their No. 4 pick to Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>Despite the lack of excitement on lottery night, knowing the fixed order allows us to start putting together a more accurate mock draft. I’ll give a choice of 1A or 1B — a worst-case pick scenario and a possible trade for each team in the top three — along with a normal mock for the rest of the lottery.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1A: Ben Simmons</strong></p>\n<p>The Sixers have to be keyed in on Ben Simmons in the pre-draft process. While Ingram won’t be a disaster pick, Simmons is the exact type of player they’ve been looking for during this entire process. Whether or not he reaches his ceiling, that ceiling is a perennial all-star, and there’s no reason to pass that up because of a season with mixed results at LSU.</p>\n<p>The Simmons-Embiid pick and roll is the Sixers’ best shot at having a truly un-guardable play in their arsenal, and Jahlil Okafor and Dario Saric are not of the ilk to throw that away. Finding a team to take those two in return for established role players would be an easy feat, with the Celtics being a team that was already rumored to have interest in Okafor during the trade deadline.</p>\n<p>Simmons would force the Sixers to clear out an overcrowded front court, but Bryan Colangelo seems intent on roster change anyway, making Simmons an even clearer choice.</p>\n<p><strong>1B: Brandon Ingram</strong></p>\n<p>If they get cold feet, Ingram won’t be an atrocious pick, as he will allow the team to stay together. If Saric turns out to be an immediate threat on offense and he and Ingram rain threes around further-along-than-we-thought Embiid and Okafor post-ups all season, then this pick doesn’t look half bad.</p>\n<p>Ingram would most likely start at shooting guard alongside Embiid, Saric and Robert Covington in a lineup that has to look promising to Sixers fans with three potential Rookie of the Year candidates.</p>\n<p>Considering that Simmons may force his way to Los Angeles — an unlikely but imaginable scenario — Ingram is a decent plan B for the Sixers.</p>\n<p><strong>Worst Case: Kris Dunn</strong></p>\n<p>While Dunn is a solid player and point guard is a position of need for the Sixers, he is certainly not worth the top pick. They could trade back with a team like the Celtics, Suns or even the Timberwolves depending on what they were looking for in return, but with such a perceived gap between Simmons, Ingram and the rest of the draft, this seems unlikely.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential trades:</strong></p>\n<p>Separated into two groups: trading down in the draft and trading for a star.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading down</strong>: (<strong>Celtics</strong>) Sixers get pick No. 3, pick No. 16, pick No. 23, Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk and Celtics get pick No. 1; (<strong>Suns</strong>) Sixers get pick No. 4, pick No. 13, Devin Booker, PJ Tucker and Suns get pick No. 1; (<strong>Timberwolves</strong>) Sixers get pick No. 5, Ricky Rubio, Zach LaVine.</p>\n<p>Each of these trades gives the Sixers a credible way to build their backcourt while still maintaining a value based approach and getting a good deal of bang for their buck. My favorite deal would probably be some form of the one with the Suns, as Booker and Dunn could combine for a really skilled backcourt and Tucker would provide a veteran who could actually contribute to this Philadelphia team.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading for a star</strong>: Sixers get Paul George and Pacers get pick No. 1, Dario Saric and Nerlens Noel; Sixers get Jimmy Butler and Bulls get pick No. 1, Nerlens Noel and Jerami Grant.</p>\n<p>These are the two names (George and Butler) that have been thrown out a lot since the end of the season, and both fit huge holes in both the Sixers roster and [[the]] rebuilding project. If the Pacers or Bulls were to agree to a version of these offers, probably excluding only Joel Embiid, the Sixers should be quick to accept.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Los Angeles Lakers</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>1A: Ben Simmons</strong></p>\n<p>The Sixers taking Ingram is still the best case scenario for the Lakers, who desperately need another source of efficient offense to pair with D’Angelo Russell. Simmons would be a bit of an awkward fit while Russell has the ball in his hands, but two players with that kind of passing ability on the same team causes the heart to flutter.</p>\n<p>Luke Walton would have his centerpieces of the future, and though it might not be enough to save Jim Buss’ job, drafting Ben Simmons would bring stability back to “Lakernation.”</p>\n<p><strong>1B: Brandon Ingram</strong></p>\n<p>If the Sixers make the correct pick, the Lakers are left with another easy choice as they’ll snatch up Ingram and allow Randle to stay in the starting lineup. While Randle is certainly worthy of a bench role with Simmons on the team, him running pick and roll with Russell, surrounded by capable shooters in Ingram and Clarkson, is the beginning of a productive offense.</p>\n<p>Ingram may well be better than Simmons if he hits all his ceilings, and he is a year younger than the Australian native, but the likelihood that he reaches his peak seems less compared the young man who came close to averaging 20, 10 and five in his freshman season in college, albeit on a sorry LSU team.</p>\n<p>In the long term, an Ingram and Russell duo may even be able to play with one another in the backcourt in a super tall lineup that could baffle defenses with skill and size. Ingram’s ability to play three different positions will drastically help the Lakers embrace contemporary NBA basketball.</p>\n<p><strong>Worst Case: Buddy Hield</strong></p>\n<p>The Lakers maybe become enamored with the college stardom of Buddy Hield, either one of the obvious picks really disappoints pre-draft and the Lakers pass on a star to draft a guy who doesn’t fit with either Clarkson or Russell. However, this scenario is unlikely as scouts have had Ingram and Simmons pegged as the one and two picks for months.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential trades</strong>: D’Angelo Russell and pick No. 2 for either Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Demarcus Cousins or James Harden. While the Pacers, Bulls, Kings and Rockets will probably choose to keep their developed stars, if any team shows interest in a deal, the Lakers should jump at the opportunity and hope they can use it to entice Kevin Durant or another top-line free agent.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Boston Celtics</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>1A: Dragan Bender</strong></p>\n<p>Bender is a solid consolation prize for Boston, fitting the mold of a rangy, shot-blocking four who appears fully equipped to one day have a potent offensive game. While young and undeveloped, according to <em>RealGM</em>.<em>com,</em> Bender shot over 36 percent on 1.92 three pointers per game, solid numbers considering he played only 12 minutes per contest with Maccabi Tel Aviv in the 2015-16 season of international competition.</p>\n<p>His steal and block percentages sit at 2.17 and 6.17, respectively, for the same international competition this year via <em>RealGm.com</em>, numbers that would place him toward the top of the league for a big man in both categories according to <em>Basketballreference</em>.<em>com</em>. Bender is also a good athlete and should be able to play the three through five positions in time, which could be important to the mobile defense the Celtics are trying to construct.</p>\n<p>If Bender shows the ability to combine what could be an unsolvable offensive game with adaptable defense, his ceiling becomes much higher. Brad Stevens is the perfect coach to develop the seven-footer’s unique game, and Bender would finally give Boston a prospect with star-level ceiling.</p>\n<p>Assuming he’s there at three and there’s no trade offer from the teams mentioned in the Lakers section, Danny Ainge would be a fool to pass on such a perfect talent for the innovative team he’s creating.</p>\n<p><strong>1B: Marquese Chriss</strong></p>\n<p>The Celtics don’t have a great second option here, as guards are what this draft has to offer despite the fact that Boston has a roster full of them. Kris Dunn is probably the third or fourth best player in this draft, but Dunn’s talent isn’t daunting enough to blow up one of the cheapest and deepest backcourts in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Jamal Murray can shoot the heck out of the ball, but his other NBA level skills are lacking to say the least, making his ceiling far too low for the No. 3 pick. Though Buddy Hield showed a well-developed game in his senior year, his measurables weren’t impressive enough to allow him to play comfortably at the three in small ball lineups, something else that would clog up the C’s backcourt.</p>\n<p>Thus, if the Celtics are going to pass on Bender, they should do it for the player with nearly the most potential in this draft, Marquese Chriss. No player in this draft — not Ben Simmons, not Brandon Ingram, nobody — will blow your mind on certain plays like Marquese Chriss. His jumping ability, speed and nose for the ball give him the potential to be a real force in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Brad Stevens would be a great coach to bring Chriss along slowly, and his potential shot blocking and controlled aggression fits seamlessly with Smart, Bradley and Crowder in a swarming Boston defensive unit. The Celtics are in no need of quality role players; they have a team filled top to bottom with guys who could easily find a spot on every NBA rotation. The Celtics are in need of true transformational talents, making Chriss an easy pick over the likes of Murray and Hield.</p>\n<p><strong>Worst case: trading the pick for a non-star</strong></p>\n<p>The worst case for the Celtics is Ainge getting antsy and trading away the pick because he doesn’t want to develop a raw player like Bender or Chriss. While Celtics fans certainly want to be in contention soon, there are nearly zero options better than choosing either one of the young swings in Bender or Chriss.</p>\n<p>Jahlil Okafor’s name has been bandied about as a trade target with the No. 3 pick, and though his playmaking and ability to put the ball in the bucket would fit nicely with the Celtics, Bender and Chriss each offer a much more reliable path in the years to come. Stevens loves players who can toggle between the wing and big man positions, and at the three spot in the draft he should have his choice between two superior options.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade options</strong>: <strong>Gordon Hayward or Derrick Favors in a “who says no” offer</strong>.</p>\n<p>Bender and Chriss certainly hold the talent to be better than those two, but the uncertainty they get there is substantial. Hayward and Favors immediately make the Celtics more serious in the East and up Boston’s free-agent profile considerably.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Phoenix Suns: Marquese Chriss</strong></p>\n<p>They will be hoping Dragan Bender falls to them, and it wouldn’t be a surprising outcome to see the Suns attempt to trade up with the Celtics. There is a huge hole at the four and on the wing in Phoenix, making Jaylen Brown an option as a project pick and Chriss a sneaky candidate once again.</p>\n<p>Assuming Bender goes third, the Suns should go with Chriss, as he could potentially offer a more athletic option next to the plodding Alex Len in a future frontcourt. If Bledsoe is able to step up his defensive consistency and Len can develop better verticality at the rim, Chriss could be the defensive star that can mask Brandon Knight and Devin Booker on the wing.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Minnesota Timberwolves: Buddy Hield</strong></p>\n<p>Hield is the perfect fit for the Timberwolves, and it would be a dream for Minnesota fans if he were to fall to them at the No. 5 pick. With Rubio still the point guard of the future, accumulating shooting should be the priority for the Wolves around him and Karl-Anthony Towns.</p>\n<p>Hield and Murray are the two best shooters in the draft and will present Tom Thibodeau with a difficult decision as Murray could develop into a secondary ball handler, allowing the mercurial UCLA product Zach LeVine to stay at his natural two-guard position in the long term.</p>\n<p>Thibodeau will be interested in moving this developing team along, and Hield offers the best chance to solidify the shooting guard position for Minnesota, and, along with progress from Tyus Jones, the entire backcourt.</p>\n<p><strong>6) New Orleans Pelicans: Jamal Murray</strong></p>\n<p>An ideal course of events for the Pelicans, with Murray they grab their Eric Gordon replacement as well as an insurance plan for Jrue Holiday. The Pelicans are still in desperate need of bigs to play with Anthony Davis, but unless Bender or Chriss fall to them, there aren’t many viable options at six.</p>\n<p>Murray would provide a nice offensive option for Alvin Gentry, and his young age finally gives the Pelicans another lottery ticket after doing their best to rid themselves of all the ones they had at the start of the Anthony Davis era. Jaylen Brown could also be an interesting option for similar home-run potential reasons, though their need for shooting will outweigh the need for wing depth. Kris Dunn might be the best pick if Holiday is going to leave in a season, but the desire to win now will eschew the Pelicans from drafting the Providence star.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Denver Nuggets: Jaylen Brown</strong></p>\n<p>On a team filled with promising young players, Denver can afford to roll the dice on the raw Cal product Jaylen Brown to be its wing of the future. While his and Mudiay’s shooting might be untenable together on the court, the thought of those two cloaking the perimeter defensively has to strike fear into the minds of GMs around the league.</p>\n<p>Kris Dunn is still the best player on the board, but the Nuggets have Mudiay and creating a logjam at the point doesn’t seem to be in their best interest. Henry Ellenson could fit nicely next to Nikola Jokic and Jusef Nurkic, but more athleticism is probably warranted in an ideal four-five pairing.</p>\n<p><strong>8) Sacramento Kings: Kris Dunn</strong></p>\n<p>Another best-case scenario — this time for the Kings — Kris Dunn is an exquisite replacement for Rajon Rondo and would hopefully save Sacramento from doling out a big contract to the assist gorger. Dunn would finally give the Kings a young and talented option at point guard, and his consistent defense will be a welcomed addition for new coach Dave Joerger.</p>\n<p>Dunn has the ability to compete from day one and should pair perfectly with Cousins for a revamped Kings season in the new arena. Vlade Divac should have his heart set on the Providence talent with any player mock-drafted above him being a solid consolation prize.</p>\n<p><strong>9) Toronto Raptors: Denzel Valentine</strong></p>\n<p>With most of the big potential guys off the board (Jaylen Brown, Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender), the Raptors should go with a player who can solve many of the issues that are causing them to crater against Cleveland.</p>\n<p>Valentine was a solid three-point shooter in his final two collegiate seasons, with a free throw percentage above 80 percent via <em>Sports-reference.com</em>, suggesting that he’ll be able to continue that production in the NBA. Valentine is also a suburb passer, providing a cure for the Raptors’ inability to move the ball on offense. He gives them some DeMar DeRozan insurance as far as ball-handling, and even if they bring back the USC alumni, Valentine could still perform immediately in a role off the bench.</p>\n<p><strong>10) Milwaukee Bucks: Deyonta Davis</strong></p>\n<p>The Bucks are in need of a center to play with their young guns on the wing, and so far Greg Monroe has not fit the part. Davis’ ability to protect the rim and potential to be a solid rim runner make this a good value pick for the Bucks. He’s still young enough to have dominant upside, and his defensive potential is what the Bucks need next to Jabari Parker who may possibly be a terrible defender his entire career.</p>\n<p>Though Jakob Poeltl might be the better player in a vacuum, Davis’ athleticism makes him a better fit for the switching of the Bucks run on defense. If his jumper continues to develop, he could even play some spot minutes alongside Greg Monroe, covering up the big man’s defensive weaknesses.</p>\n<p><strong>11) Orlando Magic: Skal Labissiere</strong></p>\n<p>Labissiere gives the Magic another shot at blue-chip talent, and if he were to pan out, he is a perfect fit next to either Aaron Gordon or Nikola Vucevic. His shooting would open the floor for both big men, and his potential shot blocking would cover up for Vucevic’s defensive failures.</p>\n<p>The Magic hope to do well in free agency, and with Frank Vogel’s impact on a young, improving roster they should be back in the playoffs next season. The Magic have a great young core two to four players deep, ergo they can aim high for a guy who many had ranked as the presumptive No. 1 pick going into the college season.</p>\n<p><strong>12) Utah Jazz: Wayne Baldwin IV</strong></p>\n<p>An impressive ball handler who plays with energy, Baldwin was one of the most prolific overall college players statistically in 2015-16 according to Kevin Pelton of <em>ESPN.com</em>. Baldwin gives the Jazz depth in Exum’s first season back from a torn ACL, and if both players improve their shot somewhat, they could play together in a lineup with two capable, aggressive ball-handlers.</p>\n<p>While shooting guards Furkan Korkmaz and Malachi Richardson possibly offer a wider range of potential and give Utah the ability to amass depth on the wing. Point guard was the biggest issue for the Jazz last year and they should look to address that problem with another young building block.</p>\n<p><strong>13) Phoenix Suns: Henry Ellenson</strong></p>\n<p>The Suns grab a talented prospect in Ellenson, who may well go in the top ten, but they seem too slow on defense and may be defined as too one-dimensional at the four to warrant such a high selection. That said, the young power forward is very skilled, has a decent shooting touch and, at nineteen years old, could develop into a steal at the 13th spot for Phoenix.</p>\n<p><strong>14) Chicago Bulls: Jakob Poeltl</strong></p>\n<p>Poeltl is a great fit for a semi-rebuilding Bulls team in need of a replacement for the free-agent Pau Gasol. The center out of Utah has a short standing reach and wingspan, along with an old-school game that makes him undraftable in the top 10. In a defined role, however, he could develop into the big body that Nikola Mitotic needs alongside him in order to be effective. If Poeltl can continue to refine his body and give arduous effort while on the floor, the Bulls could end up with the best center in the draft with the final lottery selection.</p><div

attempts per game, both career highs. While possibly aberrational, Crowder displayed decent form and would benefit from a demotion in the offensive rotation.</p>\n<p>Avery Bradley showed a vastly improved offensive game, scoring a career high 15.2 points per contest with an effective field goal percentage of 52 percent, the best efficiency since his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>Bradley continued the Brad Stevens-induced trend of substituting three point jumpers for what had been long-twos, contributing to his uptick in scoring efficiency. The former Longhorn put forth another superior defensive season, which was highlighted in the Celtics’ two clashes with Golden State in which he starred in his audition as the league’s best Steph Curry defender.</p>\n<p>The development of Thomas, Crowder and Bradley asserted them as the above-average NBA starters. Paired with a rim-protector and another shot-creator, Boston has the beginning of an elite starting lineup. The flaws of one dimensional players such as Marcus Smart and Kelly Olynyk don’t look so glaring when they are relegated to bench roles.</p>\n<p>With free agency rolling around again this summer, the true question is: What additions will the Celtics make?</p>\n<p>The free agency market is ripe with players to fill the Celtics’ needs and the suitors will be beyond plentiful. Where Danny Ainge directs his attention in the early days of July will be fascinating. Without further ado, here are a few suggestions as to who Boston could possibly pursue:</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Position: Center </strong></p>\n<p>Flushed with cap space, the Celtics can afford to target the defensive presence at the rim they’ve sorely missed since the departure of Kevin Garnett. While the Raptors’ center has played himself into a max contract in the series against the Cavaliers, he will be worthy of an overpay to take a good defense built on effort and intelligence to an elite level.</p>\n<p>If the Celtics target the block machine, however, they will need to prioritize scoring and ball-handling on the wing as they will receive a little to no contribution from Bismack Biyombo on that end. Biyombo’s hands are bad, but the staff could help him develop a slightly better lob catch, turning him into a decent rim-runner.</p>\n<p>Though there is uncertainty concerning Biyombo’s age (23), he’s shown nothing to suggest his game will suffer a large drop off over the next four years. A team nestled up against the cap with one big move left would be remiss in putting all their eggs in Biyombo’s basket; a team like the Celtics, though, with several rookie scale and bargain veteran contracts extending through the cap boom, should feel comfortable targeting him.</p>\n<p>Ian Mahinmi is another option for the C’s, possibly at a slightly lower price tag as he is Biyombo’s senior by a decent margin at the age of 29, though he offers less mobility on the perimeter and functions more as a point-blank rim protector.</p>\n<p>Neither Hassan Whiteside nor Dwight Howard seem to fit the Celtics’ faster style of play, and too much uncertainty surrounds Festus Ezeli’s health for Ainge to lure him away from Golden State with a substantial offer. Joakim Noah would be a good fit on the floor, adding the best playmaking and defense Brad Stevens has had at the center spot during his coaching tenure.</p>\n<p>Timofey Mozgov and Donatas Motiejunas are possible reclamation projects, too. Mozgov could still flourish as a force in the lane with four shooters around him, and Motiejunas would allow the Celtics to go five-out for the entire game with Olynyk as his backup. Both players might be available on cheaper contracts after disappointing seasons, but with so much cap space around the league they could be bound for expensive deals that aren’t cost-effective for Boston.</p>\n<p>Miles Plumlee is also a viable option and would be a good target if the Celtics find this crop of centers unappealing compared to 2017 or 2018. The latter class has a great deal of star power at the five, including Derrick Favors, DeMarcus Cousins and Brook Lopez.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Position: Wing</strong></p>\n<p>The Celtics will make a pitch for Kevin Durant, but they can’t realistically offer him a better opportunity to win than the Thunder, making plans B, C and D very important.</p>\n<p>Jared Dudley should be a priority for Boston; they can spend heavily on a one or two year deal or get a bargain on a longer contract. Dudley, turning 31 this summer, should have four years of consistent basketball left in him, though injury concerns make a hefty deal doubtful.</p>\n<p>The Boston College alum would be best served coming off the bench as he is able to replace Crowder and also play alongside him in a smaller unit that could easily switch on defense, especially if paired with Marcus Smart at the shooting guard.</p>\n<p>Marvin Williams is appealing for similar reasons, as the four man offers a reliable three point shot and switching ability as a player who has been a small forward at times in his career. In a contract season, Williams was a top 10 power forward in ESPN’s real plus-minus rating, but whether or not that’s replicable is certainly up in the air. He is passing the age 30 threshold in 2016, making a long team deal his priority. However, he is a questionable proposition for a Celtics team looking to maintain future flexibility.</p>\n<p>From the restricted market, Solomon Hill would be a nice addition as a versatile defender, though the Celtics could use someone with more offensive gravity. Moe Harkless is another option, though the Blazers will be likely to match any offer within reason.</p>\n<p>The most impactful possibilities on the wing are Chandler Parsons, who will exercise his player option and become a free agent, and Nicolas Batum. The Mavericks’ small forward would bring juice to the Celtics offense as his silky shot and ball-handling ability would fit seamlessly with Stevens’ five-out aspirations.</p>\n<p>Batum would fit for similar reasons, though he seems committed to staying in Charlotte and carrying the offensive burden he received in his first year as a Hornet, the most substantial of his career.</p>\n<p>Both will hopefully hear from Ainge, as players of their ilk are to be coveted by every NBA team in 2016. Though there are no star players in this class apart from Durant, adding Parsons or Batum would still vault the Celtics meaningfully higher in the East hierarchy.</p>\n<p>With guards a complete non-priority for Boston, they will be free to focus their spending on the frontcourt while hopefully maintaining enough cap space to bring back Amir Johnson and Jonas Jerebko. Both have guarantee dates of July 3, two days after the free agency moratorium begins, giving the Celtics time to strike before deciding their fate.</p>\n<p>Adding Dudley and Biyombo on one- or two-year expensive contracts — allowing them to return to free agency while there’s an obscene amount of cap space available — would be a sound strategy for both sides. If long-term deals are necessary, both should be valuable enough to prove as trade assets during their first years in Boston, allowing the Celtics to welcome any star player made available for trade with open arms.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/","id":3309,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3308,3307,3306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Final Home Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB wins its final home series of the season and makes sure seniors get a great send-off.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With balloons, streamers and an enthusiastic crowd, the UCSB softball team celebrated their seniors in suburb fashion, winning two out of its three games against the Hawaii Rainbow Wahine this past weekend.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70567\" style=\"width: 199px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70567\" data-attachment-id=\"70567\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/softball_vshawaii-20160430-dustinharris-4-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-4-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70567\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=189%2C283\" alt=\"In her last home game as a senior, Ashley Ludlow throws a pitch.

Jacqueline Hinojosa then bunted down the third base line, reaching first on an error by the first year infielder Nicole Lopez. Stacy Cavazos came though again with a shot to the left-center warning track, where first year center fielder Sarah Muzik ran into the wall trying to catch the ball.</p>\n<p>After Jessica Johnston reached on a fielders choice with Tetzlaff being thrown out at home, Melanie Menor beat out a ranging throw from the shortstop Ojala to score Hinojosa from third.</p>\n<p>In the next at-bat, a fly ball off the bat of Arianna Palomares was dropped by left fielder Ulu Matagiese, allowing both Jessica Johnston and Stacy Cavazos to score making the score 8-4.</p>\n<p>Senior catcher Samantha Stark walked to bring up junior Emily Brucelas, who drove one up the middle to score Melanie Menor and what would be her team’s final run.</p>\n<p>Hawai’i scored on a wild pitch the next inning, but no rally was in store as the Gauchos won the first Saturday contest 9-5, the win going to pitcher Ashley Wright.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did not fair as well in the second leg of the double header, losing 4-1 as sophomore pitcher Brittany Hitchcock went the full seven innings, allowing only six hits, one unearned run, and no walks to go along with four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>A masterful performance, Hitchcock made up for a rough outing on Friday by hitting all her spots while in the circle.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, first-year pitcher Veronica Gulvin was passable, allowing three runs in four and a third innings before being replaced by Ashley Ludlow, who closed the game in more concise fashion than her shaky start in the previous game.</p>\n<p>Four runs were plenty for the Rainbow Wahine, however, as sophomore catcher Rachel Lack’s two run homer in the third inning proved to be enough for the victory on its own putting them up 2-0. Lack would also drive in first-year left fielder Jennifer Iseri on a fifth inning single making the score 3-0.</p>\n<p>A late rally in the sixth gave the Gauchos a glimmer of hope, as senior Arianna Palomares started the action with a blooper to right field, just past the outstretched arm of Tayana Mata at second base.</p>\n<p>With Stark on second and Brucelas on first, Altmeyer rocketed one to center field, scoring Stark which made the score 3-1 in favor of the visiting team.</p>\n<p>The Friday 9-3 Gaucho victory was decided in the bottom of the third frame,</p>\n<p>where with two outs and Jessica Tetzlaff on second, back to back doubles from Melanie Menor and Arianna Palomare gave UCSB a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>After Sierra Altmeyer loaded the bases with a grounder into to left field, Jacqueline Hinojose singled up the middle to score Stark, making the score 5-1 Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Another three runs in the bottom of the sixth juxtaposed by Hawaii’s one run in the top of the inning gave UCSB a large cushion at 8-2 and let them coast to the solid win.</p>\n<p>Despite losing the final game of the series Saturday afternoon, the Gauchos were still in good spirits for their senior celebration.</p>\n<p>With parents, family members, and friends galore, the Gauchos honored both the Rainbow Wahine seniors, as well as five of their own: Ashley Ludlow, Jessica Tetzlaff, Alex Pingree, Arianna Palomares, and Samantha Stark.</p>\n<p>The weight of their accomplishments during four years at UCSB was staggering, especially when read aloud over the loudspeaker.</p>\n<p>“It was a fun ride,” said senior catcher Samantha Stark, looking back on her time at UCSB. She continued, “we ended it with a bang,” and in relation to the final two series on the road, she declared plainly, “we’ve got nothing to lose. We just want to keep fighting and take these series.”</p>\n<p>After the game, the head coach of the UCSB softball team had nothing but praises to share about the graduating seniors.</p>\n<p>“The seniors have stepped it up in the past couple of weeks.” Coach Galicinao said. “They’ve been great leaders, not only on the field, but just keeping everybody focused.”</p>\n<p>She continued, explaining, “it’s easier to stay engaged and compete when you’re one of the top two teams, but our team has been really consistent in their effort and in how they’ve been competing, and a lot of that has to do with senior leadership.”</p>\n<p>First-year Sierra Altmeyer noted that the younger players, including herself, “have become really close with the seniors,” and that they were, “just doing it for them.”</p>\n<p>The camaraderie was more obvious than ever for the UCSB softball team on Saturday, as a tight-knit group of players came together to win the final home series of the 2016 season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is a doubleheader against UC Davis Saturday, May 7 beginning at 1 p.m. with the second game starting at 3 p.m. at La Rue Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Following a sacrifice bunt and a line-out, UCSB pitcher Kyle Hatton lost control of the inning, walking and hitting the next two batters before allowing a two RBI single to center field off the bat of shortstop Justin Bridgman.</p>\n<p>After hitting the right fielder Trenton Brooks to again load the bases, Hatton overthrew a pickoff attempt to first base, allowing Nevada to score catcher Kaleb Foster and Justin Bridgman before a deep fly ball to center ended the inning with the WolfPack holding a 4-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>Despite the rough stretch, coach Andrew Checketts stuck with his freshman lefty which payed off as Hatton settled in nicely, throwing four and a third more innings of scoreless baseball.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started a scoring barrage of their own in the bottom of the third, led by standout Muno who hit a single to right field. After advancing to second on a wild pitch and stealing third, freshman second baseman Tevin Mitchell hit Muno home with a scorching double to right-center field.</p>\n<p>Following walks from redshirt junior Andrew Calica and redshirt sophomore Josh Adams to load the bases, redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover singled to center field bringing in both Mitchell and Calica for a total of three runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Kyle Nelson’s first inning was impressive considering he inherited runners on first and second base left by the starter Hatton. After coaxing a fly out to center from junior right fielder Trenton Brooks, senior third baseman Bryce Greager reached first to load the bases on a fielding error by Muno. The left hander showed his resiliency, however, and struck out the final batter to get out of the inning unscathed.</p>\n<p>Carrying a 4-3 deficit into the bottom of the eighth, the Gauchos started the inning hot with a double rocketed down the left field line by Grover. Junior utility Billy Fredrick followed with a weak bunt, but was able to beat the throw to first with a beautiful slide.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Devon Gradford, a defensive substitute in the top of the frame, then reached first on a fielding error by the first baseman Jordan Pearce, advancing Fredrick to second and scoring Grover, tying the game at four.</p>\n<p>Muno then bunted the two baserunners over to second and third before a long fly ball by senior Ryan Clark, pinch hitting for freshman Tevin Mitchell, was caught by the center fielder who was unable to throw out Billy Fredrick tagging up from third giving the Gauchos their first lead of the game at 5-4.</p>\n<p>Despite a single in the last inning by junior shortstop Justin Bridgman, Nelson had no problem shutting down the Wolfpack, and earning his sixth win of the season.</p>\n<p>Muno was the star of the game for UCSB, going two for three and making several essential plays for his team, especially his batting work in the third and eighth innings. He continued his stellar play from the weekend series against Cal State Northridge, showing his versatility in his ability to toggle between second and third base.</p>\n<p>Coach Checketts liked the play of his freshman second baseman Tevin Mitchell, who unfortunately is simply buried on the depth chart by the wealth of infield talent on the roster. Checketts noted, however, that Mitchell, “had really good at-bats, played good defense at second base,” and that they see him as a, “future star.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is Friday, April 22 against their biggest rival Cal Poly at 6 p.m. at Robin Baggett Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70122\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70122\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/","id":4184,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4183,4182,4181],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/292"}},"__N_SSG":true}
