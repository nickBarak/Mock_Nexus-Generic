a local government official questioned if the project is feasible. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The sexual assault “report card” is one of 12 demands that UC Santa Barbara administrators agreed to address in May 2017 after a student sit-in. But so far, neither the university nor the local government has started to work on it.</p>\n<p>The demand calls for the university to “work with the Isla Vista Community Services District to develop a report card… for behaviors and education surrounding rape and sexual assault in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>At a Feb. 8 town hall, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn featured the report card in a slideshow documenting the progress made on the demands. In the slideshow, the report card was listed as “in progress.”</p>\n<p>But the university did not contact I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand about the report card until Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“The CSD looks forward to working with the university on these continued efforts, but at this point there has not been a partnership on that front,” Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> after a Feb. 12 CSD meeting.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said she was under the impression that the CSD was working directly with students on the report card.</p>\n<p>“It had come up at one of the meetings that we had, where I was told that students were working directly with the CSD on that item,” Klawunn said. “I thought I was only reporting progress that was being made.” She said she did not remember who had told her or at which meeting.</p>\n<p>Klawunn spoke to Bertrand about the report card on Tuesday night, after the <em>Nexus </em>had inquired about the university’s progress. She said Bertrand told her that the report card is not actually feasible.</p>\n<p>“I sought Ethan out yesterday and asked him,” she said. “He said, ‘No, we can’t do it the way [Ro’Shawndra Earvin] had hoped it’d be carried out.’” Earvin led the 2017 sit-in.</p>\n<p>The demand calls for documenting crime in I.V. and counting the number of meetings that have educated the community about sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Local officials will need to find a different way to create a report card, Klawunn said. She suggested creating local crime reports as an alternative. Bertrand could not be reached to elaborate on how an alternate report card would look.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 22 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/","id":4811,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4810,4809,4808],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Graduate Student Dies in Crash After Driving Wrong Way on Highway 101","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2018-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/JKopecky_5.25.10_Freeway-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/JKopecky_5.25.10_Freeway-1.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"While traveling at normal freeway speed, the victim’s 2012 Nissan Sentra collided with a concrete rail on the freeway median.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A UC Santa Barbara graduate student and Isla Vista resident died early Saturday morning after driving the wrong way on Highway 101, California Highway Patrol (CHP) reported.</p>\n<p>Alan Anhphi Vu, 28, was reportedly driving north on a 101 southbound lane in Santa Barbara at 1:58 a.m. While traveling at normal freeway speed, Vu’s 2012 Nissan Sentra collided with a concrete rail on the freeway median.

In his writing, Rodger bemoans his “inability to find a girlfriend,” condemns interracial couples and laments that a black man — “descended from slaves” — can “get a white girl,” while he cannot.</p>\n<p>On May 23, 2014, Rodger, then a second-year student at Santa Barbara City College, stabbed three of his housemates before driving through Isla Vista and opening fire on street-goers. In the years since, he has become an internet meme on alt-right forums. Posters frequently invoke his memory to highlight misogynistic, anti-feminist ideology.</p>\n<p>Rodger’s link to Nazi ideology was established as early as Feb. 2015 when the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) released its full report on Rodger’s killing spree. Rodger searched the internet for phrases like “Adolf Hitler and the law of attraction,” “Nazi curbstomp” and “Holocaust of black people,” the <em>Nexus</em> <a

Spencer coined the phrase “alt-right” as far back as 2008, but since the turn of the decade, the ideology has gained prominence, especially with the rise of meme culture and a surge in far-right sympathies in global politics.</p>\n<p>In all, the SPLC listed 13 alt-right killers, including Dylann Roof, who in 2015 killed nine people in a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Juan Camarena. <em>Courtesy of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div>\n<p>Lt. Juan Camarena will transfer from the Human Resources Bureau of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), where he has worked for 19 years, including service in the Major Crimes Division.</p>\n<p>Cintron was transferred to the Criminal Investigations Bureau, where he intends to ride out a nearly 28-year career into retirement. His transfer was part of a regular SBSO rotational schedule, under which officers serve for about two years in a division before rotating to another job.</p>\n<p>This won’t be the first time Camarena will serve in I.V., as he worked brief stints with the IVFP while he was a sheriff’s deputy in the late 2000s. He noted that I.V. today has a far less populous weekend party scene, crediting his predecessors for “making things safer” for the community.</p>\n<p>Born in Mexico to migrant field workers, Camarena is a first-language Spanish speaker, reader and writer. He joined the Marines out of high school before starting at the SBSO.</p>\n<p>Camarena said he will open his doors to both UC Santa Barbara students and I.V.’s robust Spanish-speaking population. While he’s getting settled into the job and familiarizing himself with the neighborhood, he said he will work to police by the “golden rule.”</p>\n<p>“Using just the simple values I learned from my parents will open the doors for me to address the community and build that trust,” he said.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents in the past year have reacted strongly to reports of burglaries and sexual assaults.</p>\n<p>In May, Cintron attended an I.V. Community Services District Town Hall to address resident concerns directly. Camarena emphasized his own commitment to preventing assaults from occurring. While law enforcement won’t have all the answers, he said, a unified I.V. might be a step toward solution.</p>\n<p>“Little by little, I’m trying to introduce myself to the different communities so we can see what we in law enforcement and the community need to do to find that fair balance, so I.V. will be a safe place to live, to work in and visit,” Camarena said.</p>\n<p><strong>Cintron, by the numbers </strong></p>\n<p>Since Cintron came onto the IVFP in March 2016, crime rates have roughly improved in the neighborhood over a two-year period, according to statistics provided by SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover.</p>\n<p>There were 190 burglaries in I.V in 2015, 196 in 2016 and 106 in 2017 through Nov. 29.</p>\n<p>When it comes to simple and aggravated assault, the numbers fluctuated.</p>\n<p>Between July 2015 and June 2016 there were 181 simple assaults, while between July 2016 and June 2017 there were 149.</p>\n<p>There were 35 aggravated assaults between July 2015 and June 2016 and 37 between July 2016 and June 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Cintron reflects on achievements, challenges</strong></p>\n<p>Cintron, who took up the post of station lieutenant in March 2016, said he believes he helped I.V. continue a “trajectory toward the better” during his time.</p>\n<p>“I fully embraced and engaged with the community,” he said. His proudest efforts were put toward preserving community safety and reducing police presence during Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement presence decreased under Cintron’s watch, alongside a decline in crime. During the four-day period through Halloween 2016, the IVFP stationed nearly 300 officers. Less than 100 IVFP officers patrolled the streets during the same period in 2017.</p>\n<p>Cintron’s tenure didn’t go without controversy. A proposed noise ordinance in Oct. 2016 threatened to scale existing “no-loud-music” restrictions from midnight back to 10 p.m. on weekend nights. A sizable community response, comprised mostly of UCSB students, railed against the proposition. The IVFP promptly <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-17/foot-patrol-postpones-noise-ordinance-change-in-response-to-community-pushback/\">delayed</a> and later nixed the plan.<br>\nCintron maintains that the noise ordinance was never his idea; before he’d arrived, the IVFP was “constantly” receiving noise complaints and Cintron was told to finish the job, he said.</p>\n<p>For the most part, though, the community has made things easier for him, he said, which will, in turn, make things easier for Camarena, whom he called “very open-minded.”</p>\n<p>Nearing 30 years on the job at the SBSO, Cintron’s stint in I.V. will likely be the penultimate leg of his career.</p>\n<p>“It was a challenge, but I learned a lot,” he said. “A lot of different ideas from different people. It was a good time. A good two years.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 4 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Many experienced lung problems from the smoke and ash in the air. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was horrific,” said Darren Schmitt, a 46-year-old homeless local. Schmitt regularly sleeps on a cushion behind Embarcadero Hall, tucked in a corner out of sight of the students passing by.</p>\n<p>When the air quality in I.V. plummeted in the wake of the Thomas Fire, most students fled the neighborhood for their permanent residences. Schmitt stayed on the streets.</p>\n<p>“I watched ash drop all night here,” he said. “Everyone else was wearing [the masks], but I didn’t, so I felt like puking.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, a group of good Samaritans handed him a mask. But Schmitt, uninformed of just how bad the air had gotten, didn’t feel like wearing the mask all day. Believing his mask to not be fully effective, he discarded it.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, volunteer chaplain at the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office, said events like these are far more than unfortunate for the “house-less” of I.V. — they’re life-threatening.</p>\n<p>“You take someone who’s got respiratory problems to begin with — many of them are smokers — and it’s desperation,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>Some of those seeking shelter experienced asthma attacks, coughing and hacking as they finally arrived to an environment with cleaner air.</p>\n<p>Others suffer from lung-related ailments like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or emphysema. Hedges himself felt pain in his lungs, he said, though he had a home to return to.</p>\n<p>Homeless locals are allowed entry to a Warming Center at the University United Methodist Church on Camino Del Sur. Those straying in can receive dinner and blankets.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been doing this for 10 years, serving our community and making sure our friends without a home have a place to go to when it’s cold and wet outside,” said Ed Wesson, operational manager for the Freedom Warming Centers of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Warming Center opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 6:00 a.m. the next day. At that time, Schmitt said, those who stayed overnight are told to leave, regardless of the weather outside.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s pouring rain,” Schmitt said. “We’re sent out onto the street.”</p>\n<p>In the case of last week’s rainfall, Schmitt escaped to an underground garage in Goleta and hid until the storm cleared.</p>\n<p>“When rain like that comes, we get wet, and all our stuff gets wet,” added another local, who would identify himself only as Jeffrey.</p>\n<p>For decades of living in I.V., Jeffrey has made money by fishing at Goleta Beach and collecting recyclables. Days of heavy rain get in the way of his ability to fish, leaving him with little recourse for money.</p>\n<p>Not all the homeless despaired under the conditions. Another local, who gave his name only as Danny, scoffed at the idea that he was under distress.</p>\n<p>“We live our lives outdoors and fight through everything,” Danny said. “Rain and fire don’t scare me.”</p>\n<p>Each spring, the Central Coast Collaborative on Homeless (C3H) releases an annual census on nationwide homelessness. The 2017 account, published in March, found a population of 26 homeless I.V. locals, the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/\">reported</a>. Multiple homeless people said they were suspicious of the figure, agreeing that it felt too low. Hedges refuted the number altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe what happened with that,” Hedges said. “I know the numbers, and the count was just wrong.”</p>\n<p>If census-takers wanted to get an accurate homelessness count, Hedges said, they could attend free dinners served by local churches. When the 2010 census was taken, he rallied homeless people to sign up. If people were to stand up and be counted, Hedges said, it would make for a telling political statement.</p>\n<p>“If you stand up for a census,” he said, “it says, ‘Here I am — you’ve got to count me, I exist. Now deal with me.’”</p>\n<p>If the “powerful” were to know the extent of the problem, he said, there could one day be a difference.</p>\n<p>With the weather cleared, the homeless are free to go about their days on the I.V. streets. Some roam on their bicycles, others hang out at a stone bench on Pardall Road that they’ve dubbed “the bedrock.” Schmitt and Jeffrey sit on the ground at Anisq’Oyo Park and share a jar of peaches. When he reflects on the past month’s trying conditions, Jeffrey is animated but maintains that it doesn’t faze him.</p>\n<p>“We do have a home,” he said, lying horizontally on the ground and tucking his backpack beneath his head. “All of us out here depend on each other.”</p>\n<p>He travels light, but does carry a cardboard sign he likes to show I.V. residents walking by. It boldly reads, “Refuse to have a bad day.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 18 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/","id":4334,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4333,4332,4331],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/28"}},"__N_SSG":true}
