Truman through president Barack Obama.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross has been involved with issues concerning the Middle East for more than 20 years, and his extensive experience gives him the ability to share a unique experience. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout his career, Ross has served as special assistant to President Barack Obama, special adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">special Middle East coordinator under President Bill Clinton, director of the State Department’s Policy Planning Staff in the George H.W. Bush administration and more. Ross helped form U.S. policy toward the former Soviet Union, played a prominent role in the unification of Germany and its integration into NATO, facilitated arms control negotiations, helped to form the 1991 Gulf War coalition and assisted Israelis and Palestinians in reaching the 1995 Interim Agreement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross engaged Friday’s audience through an interactive question and answer session where he would ask the audience questions and analyze their responses. After asking the audience which presidential administration had the most tumultuous relationship with Israel, Ross said it was former President Dwight D. Eisenhower who was “the toughest on Israel.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross said there are three reasons why the United States sees Israel as “a problem and not a partner.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first assumption is that if we distance from Israel we will gain with the Arabs,” Ross said. “The second is that if we cooperate with Israel, we lose with the Arabs. The third is if we want to transform the American position in the Middle East, we need to solve the Palestinian issue first.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross then refuted each assumption using historical events as evidence. According to Ross, all three reasons are flawed, and the U.S. cannot distance itself from Israel because it is one of the few countries “we fundamentally share values with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross also shared his views on the Islamic State in Levant (ISIL), and the group’s recent act of terror in Paris that left more than a hundred dead. Ross referred to the terrorist group as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first thing we should be doing is asking how did this kind of attack take place?” Ross said. “Number two, what do we have to do to disrupt ISIS … to be geared towards thinking through how another operation is going to work through that. The third thing is we really do have to have a coherent strategy for Syria. Also finding a way to make Russia change its approach or, at a minimum, to go after ISIS.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-year psychology and sociology double major Nina Abramson said she enjoyed hearing from a political figure that has been involved in Middle East diplomacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel that the public hears about ISIS and the President’s plans with Israel through media so it was cool to get a perspective from a diplomat and hear what the different presidents felt toward Israel,” Abramson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year psychology major Mia Feller said she liked that Ross asked the audience questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it was a cool format of how he was asking people questions,” Feller said. “It kind of allowed for audience participation. I thought it was really good — a lot of information to grasp, but it was good.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB professor of religious studies Gil Ramot said he was impressed with Ambassador Ross’s “knowledge of detail.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The intimate conversations and details that he knew about the administration really impressed me,” Ramot said. “His vast knowledge about what happened between specific people and people who were in some of the most secret rooms in the government impressed me.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/dennis-ross-speaks-on-middle-eastern-relations-new-book/","id":2589,"author":{"id":136,"name":"Jessica Aguilar"},"related":[2588,2587,2586],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Award-Winning Writer Graces Campbell Hall to Speak on Chilean Mining Accident","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tobar_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tobar_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Héctor Tobar lectured on his recent book, Deep Down Dark, Monday night at Campbell Hall in an event hosted by UCSB Arts & Lectures.

Tobar was the only journalist the miners granted permission to record the story.</p>\n<p>In an interview preceding the lecture, Tobar said coming from an immigrant, Latino family, he felt like an “outsider” in higher education, which he believes ultimately “served him well” as a journalist and author.</p>\n<p>“I always felt like I didn’t get a great education and I was with all these people who had been really well educated,” Tobar said. “It turned out that those qualities that you have as someone who is an outsider and someone who is maybe more humble, those are great qualities to have when you’re a journalist, because it breaks down the barrier between you and the person you’re interviewing.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said one miner he interviewed said he reflected back on pivotal moments of his life in the moments leading up to his ultimate rescue.</p>\n<p>“One of the men told me ‘As I was going up [the capsule], I saw my life flash before my eyes. I remembered things that happened since I was young; I remembered when I met my wife; I remembered when our kids were born; I remembered when I got married,’” Tobar said.</p>\n<p>According to Tobar, the experience of longing to return home and ultimately escaping the mine was like “rebirth” for the 33 miners.</p>\n<p>“What it became for me was a story about men who want to return home,” Tobar said. “They want to be reborn into the lives they had before, they want to go back home to the routines of family.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said interviewing the miners and understanding what they valued amid the mine cave-in caused him to reflect on his own life.</p>\n<p>“In being trapped, in seeing their own deaths, in that time they have to think, they realize that the best thing about them was all the love they brought into the world and all the love that surrounded them,” Tobar said. “That’s what I’ve learned, and as a result of this project I think I value even more my own life.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said despite his accomplishments as a journalist and author, his greatest pride comes from his family.</p>\n<p>“I have many great things that have happened in my life, but the thing that I am most proud of, the best thing about me is that I’ve been married for 22 years and am a father of three kids.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said family is an “extremely powerful force” during challenges times such as the months the 33 miners spent trapped below ground.</p>\n<p>“The miners are back at home and they are fathers, husbands and providers once again,” Tobar said. “They now have the experience of living through an adventure that has taught them the value of the simple things.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Maria Garcia said she found Tobar’s lecture interesting because she did not previously understand the intensity of what the miners underwent.</p>\n<p>“I felt like I got a personal perspective on what they went through, how they suffered and what they had to go through after they came out. It was a really good lecture and I’m really glad I got to see it,” Garcia said. “And now I’m looking forward to buying the book because of everything he said, it was really interesting.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Itzel Cruz said Tobar’s lecture gave her an “inside perspective” on the miners’ story.</p>\n<p>“Seeing it on television is a completely different version than it being told by the writer itself, who personally interviewed these people, stayed with them and got to know each one of them on a personal level,” Cruz said. “You can identify yourself with the Chilean miners and the writer.”</p>\n<p>First-year journalism major at Santa Barbara City College Logan Keaton said Tobar is a “great speaker,” and the lecture made him consider the miners’ experiences in a more personal way.</p>\n<p>“I was amazed at how he got so close with all the miners,” Keaton said. “The different testimonies and experiences that all the miners had, those were inspiring and sad at times. It puts you into perspective looking at the world and everything. You can’t take anything for granted.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66071\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66071\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/","id":2632,"author":{"id":136,"name":"Jessica Aguilar"},"related":[2631,2630,2629],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/136"}},"__N_SSG":true}
