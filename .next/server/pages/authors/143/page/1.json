Metzka will be permanently closing Gio’s this week after losing a legal battle to renew his lease for the restaurant. The current lease owners have not disclosed their future plans concerning the property, and Metzka is debating opening another business in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Metzka said the legal battle was quietly “going on for years,” and he wished the situation had worked out differently.</p>\n<p>“I wish that there was other opportunities to work with the landlords, but they don’t want me in the building,” Metzka said.</p>\n<p>Metzka said he is unsure of what will happen to the building, the property or his staff after the restaurant closes.</p>\n<p>“They may tear the building down. They might try to run another restaurant. I don’t know what they’re going to do. I have no say,” Metzka said. “If they lease it to somebody else and approach my guys and say ‘hey, do you want to work for me,’ obviously they could.”</p>\n<p>Metzka is debating on whether to buy or lease another property in I.V., but said he has no potential time frame for when that may happen.</p>\n<p>“I mean this is what I do. I have talked to a couple other business owners around who are selling,” Metzka said. “I’m just trying to de-stress from all of this and evaluate. At the end of the day, I don’t know what’s going to happen.”</p>\n<p>If he decides to run another business in I.V., Metzka said he is unsure about opening another pizza place.</p>\n<p>“After having Sorrisos, Blaze and Pizza my Heart open up in 2012 and 2013, it’s like ‘Really? You already had Woodstocks, Domino’s, Pasta House and Rusty’s delivering in I.V. in 2009,’” Metzka said. “There’s seven pizza places now, the burrito places are almost as bad.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said the new property owners have the option to rebuild and remodel the building.</p>\n<p>“Someone might try to come in and run Gio’s, another type of Gio’s,” Metzka said. “Someone might come in and totally change the concept or demolish the building and make a three-story building. In fact, if I was building, that’s what I would want.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said he has met amazing people during his seven years of working at Gio’s, and will miss his interactions with staff the most.</p>\n<p>“The guys in the kitchen. Some of these guys have worked here forever. Marco, Pedro, these guys have been here five, six years,” Metzka said. “My morning chef has been here for 18 years. That’s why the food here is always so good, because the guys in the kitchen have worked here forever. I don’t change my kitchen.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67370\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67370\" data-attachment-id=\"67370\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gios-pizza-to-close-after-34-years-in-business/gios-closing_by-eric-swenson-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452714931\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gio’s Closing\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67370\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67370\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Gio’s employee and SBCC student Erin Lambie said even though she has only been working since October, she is incredibly saddened by the Gio’s closing.</p>\n<p>“It’s so sad. Just seeing how big it gets during big games and trying to talk to people like ‘Wait, what did you say? I can’t hear you,’” Lambie said. “It’s weird, but it gets so exciting. Or they call you and ask what the deal on the pitchers are and you’re like ‘they’re $6, ‘and they’re like ‘Oh my god it’s Disneyland.’”</p>\n<p>Metzka said the day before he announced the restaurant’s closure, his previous Instagram post had 14 likes and no comments. The day after he posted the closure, he received over 250 likes and 300 comments.</p>\n<p>“I mean, talk about beyond moved. I mean we’re talking about countless comments,” Metzka said. “We’re talking frowny faces and ‘I met my best friend here.’ It’s never going to be the same. These comments are fucking amazing.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Conner Jainese said the closing of Gio’s is a “tragedy” in I.V.<br>\n“Honestly, it’s the stronghold of Isla Vista and the only place where you can get a slice and a pitcher without breaking your wallet,” Jainese said.</p>\n<p>Kaylie Roujmer, fourth-year biochemistry major, said she originally thought Gio’s closing post on Instagram was a joke to get more business.<br>\n“I thought it was just a prank, like ‘No, Gio’s can’t be closing.’ Gio’s is one of the best places to get food and people just don’t believe it’s happening. I’ve even heard of people thinking of creating a petition to try and stop it from happening.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said people have been approaching him since he made a Facebook page announcing the restaurant’s closure.</p>\n<p>“I had like 30 or 40 people walk up to me and they were like ‘what the fuck?’ And I was like ‘I know,’” Metzka said. “They were like ‘this isn’t okay’ and honestly, I don’t know what to tell you.”</p>\n<p>Jainese said it was also difficult for him to believe that Gio’s will be permanently closed after Thursday night.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s one of those comedy movies where everyone gathers in the library to meet to figure out a way to save their favorite hang-out place. Everyone would use their majors and show how Gio’s has affected them to save the restaurant.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said some of his favorite weekends to work were graduation weekend, alumni weekend and Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“It was super fun. We had the last Floatopia in 2009,” Metzka said. “Then after that, when it became Deltopia, I used to go to Kmart and buy a big kiddie pool for the patio and fill it with water then say ‘oh, it’s the beach.’”</p>\n<p>Hope Curran, fourth-year global studies and art double major, said she spent a lot of time celebrating different parties and events at Gio’s.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge part of the I.V. community. Especially people over 21 come here to have fun and chill and it’s actually a great alternative to partying on D.P. with minors,” Curran said. “It’s a much more relaxed environment, and socially, I feel it’s much healthier than what you can find in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said one his favorite memories during his time at Gio’s was when a couple of girls walked in “stoned” and stood at the counter for six minutes in “dead silence.”</p>\n<p>“Me and my staff stared at them the whole time, waiting patiently. After silent menu-looking, they look at me they go ‘so how much is that so far?’ Like sweetie, no you haven’t ordered. And they’re like ‘oh fuck’ and go straight back into staring,” Metzka said.</p>\n<p>Metzka said he moved to Santa Barbara in 2000 and lived in I.V. from 2000 to 2003 before buying Gio’s in 2009.</p>\n<p>“I’m your poster child for ‘don’t go to college, don’t incur a whole lot of debt, work your ass off and buy something,’” Metzka said. “I did finish UCSB extension for a licensing certificate. I did some stuff there but college and I aren’t friends.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said he chose to buy Gio’s after spending time there with his friends when he first moved to the area.</p>\n<p>“I used to come to Gio’s and I used to eat burgers and have a beer and watch the game,” Metzka said. “This was always the spot. It was always the hang our spot. It was the biggest place in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Natalie Tran, fourth-year psychology major, said Gio’s is a landmark of I.V. and she is going to miss the restaurant’s atmosphere the most.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely the vibes, you know? You’re just not going to find that anywhere else,” Tran said. “Not at Hana Kitchen, not at Domino’s, just at Gio’s. It’s irreplaceable. I don’t even want to bike by it anymore. We’re going to miss it so much. Thank you, Gio’s.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Movement began on the steps of UC Berkeley’s Sproul Hall in 1964 when thousands of student activists insisted the University of California lift its ban on campus political activities and acknowledge students’ First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p>Among the student activists was artist and former UC Berkeley student David Goines, whose participation in the student protest led to his expulsion from the university and 60-day jail sentence.</p>\n<p>“When you’re 19 years old, that’s a long time,” Goines said.</p>\n<p>For Goines, the unrestricted expression of a student’s speech is something he and other Free Speech Movement activists had to “wrestle” away from UC with “fire and blood” in the 1960s. Now, over 50 years later, the issue of whether or not the UC can regulate student speech has come into question once again — this time, with the issue of anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>Several accounts of anti-Semitism have taken place on UC campuses over the last year. In January, students at a UC Davis-affiliated Jewish fraternity found swastikas spray-painted on their building in January, and in February, student government leaders at UCLA questioned the eligibility of a student for a campus judicial panel because of her involvement in Jewish organizations.</p>\n<p>In light of these events, over the summer the UC Board of Regents began crafting a statement which outlines their principles against “intolerant” acts such as threats, harassment, hate speech and derogatory language. After failing to draft a statement that satisfied all parties, the Regents called together a working group to form a policy that more adequately addresses anti-Semitism on university campuses.</p>\n<blockquote><p>These rights that I fought for — you want to give them away. You just want to hand them over. You don’t even want to put up a fight. Well, I think that’s disgusting.<br>\n<em>– David Goines</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Goines, hearkening back to his days in the Free Speech Movement, argues students should not allow the UC to create any sort of policy regulating the content of their speech. This, he says, is surrendering the rights which he and his fellow activists fought for decades ago.</p>\n<p>“These rights that I fought for — you want to give them away. You just want to hand them over. You don’t even want to put up a fight,” Goines said. “Well, I think that’s disgusting.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hillel executive director Rabbi Evan Goodman said free speech is not “unlimited” and the Regents need to instate a policy that protects Jewish students from anti-Semitic “hate speech.”</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, a line should be drawn — an argument he presented to the Regents at the working group’s forum in October at UCLA. Rabbi Goodman spoke and advocated for the Regents to adopt a policy on anti-Semitism similar to that of the United States Department of State, which states that denying Israel’s right to exist is an action considered anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>In a radio interview with 90.9 WBUR last May, UC President Janet Napolitano also said she personally advocates for the State Department definition of anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>“I have my own personal view, and my personal view is that we should [adopt the State Department’s definition],” Napolitano said in the interview.</p>\n<p>The State Department gives several criteria — known as the Three Ds — of the ways in which anti-Semitism “manifests itself with regard to the state of Israel.” The Three Ds include: demonizing Israel, applying a double standard to Israel and delegitimizing Israel. Within these criteria under the state definition, comparing Israeli policies to Nazi Germany, focusing on Israel solely for human rights investigations and denying the right of Israel’s existence are examples of actions that would be considered anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>In his speech to the Regents at the UCLA forum, Goodman recommended the Regents protect Jewish students from hate speech with a policy that categorizes denying Israel’s right to exist as anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>“I urge the Regents to adopt a clear, system-wide definition of anti-Semitism, including some versions of the Three Ds, with explicit policies and procedures that protect Jewish students in the UC system from experiencing a hostile environment,” Goodman said in his speech.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Accusations are made that Jews as a people are responsible for things. For example, last year posters appeared on campus that had a Jewish star and it said that Jews are responsible for 9/11.<br>\n<em>– Rabbi Evan Goodman</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Goodman, in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>, said in the past seven years working in Isla Vista he has seen a rise in more “subtle” anti-Jewish and anti-Semitic activities on UCSB’s campus.</p>\n<p>“Extreme examples are swastikas on a Jewish person’s possessions or their home or Jewish fraternity,” Goodman said. “Accusations are made that Jews as a people are responsible for things. For example, last year posters appeared on campus that had a Jewish star and it said that Jews are responsible for 9/11.”</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, the UC needs to adopt an intolerance policy like that of the State Department to adequately acknowledge the “key role” the state of Israel plays in Jewish identity.</p>\n<p>“To me, the State Department definition is not the be-all and end-all,” Goodman said. “It’s a good starting point to recognize that for the preponderance of Jewish students, connection with Israel plays a key role in their own personal, religious and cultural identity.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year psychology major Niki Elyasi said she is also in support of the State Department definition to prevent religious intolerance on campus and to protect Jewish students from discrimination.</p>\n<p>“No matter how you feel about Israel, if you value protection of all students on campus and the safety of those students on campus, then you’d value the methods in which those students tell you they feel most safe … the definition under which those students will tell you they feel most safe, not your interpretation of what that definition could mean,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<h2><strong>What About the First Amendment?</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the fundamental questions surrounding the debate to create a policy for anti-Semitism in the UC system is whether or not such a regulation would infringe on the First Amendment. There are many like Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (F.I.R.E.) attorney Will Creeley, who finds these “calls for censorship” to be worrisome in respect to free speech rights.</p>\n<p>“This is a dispute that is bitter; it is intensely felt by both sides, and I think that has resulted in calls for censorship by both sides,” Creeley said. “I’m really worried because no matter how well intentioned those matters are, they still amount to a plea for official government intervention in response to what is core speech protected by the First Amendment.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Their stated intent is to choke speech and they’re very open about that.<br>\n<em>– Attorney Liz Jackson</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Attorney Liz Jackson from Palestine Legal, an independent organization dedicated to protecting the civil and constitutional rights of people who speak out for Palestinian freedom, also views the adoption of the State Department definition of anti-Semitism as censorship of protected speech. Jackson said those who promote such a definition are purposely trying to suspend free speech rights.</p>\n<p>“They say it’s just a standard for what is considered anti-Semitic and what is not, but that is completely disingenuous and goes against the demonstrated record of attacks to censor speech on campus,” Jackson said. “Their stated intent is to choke speech and they’re very open about that.”</p>\n<p>Goines also said any attempt to regulate the content of speech is contrary to the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“If there are college students who are demanding that the government stop somebody from saying something, they simply have not read the First Amendment and do not understand it,” Goines said.</p>\n<p>However, according to Rabbi Goodman, free speech has limitations.</p>\n<p>“It should be protected and it has to be protected, but there are limits and we recognize those limits in all sorts of other areas of our lives, particularly when there’s hostility to minority groups,” Goodman said. “The Jews should be afforded the same kind of protections that those other minority groups get.”</p>\n<p>Elyasi said she does not think the UC adopting the State Department definition will violate anyone’s First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p>“On a federal level everyone is entitled to whatever they want to say for anyone about anything. That is what free speech is,” Elyasi said. “You wouldn’t go into a LGBTQ+ meeting shouting homophobic slurs. Jewish students want the same protection because anti-Semitism is on the rise.”</p>\n<p>Creeley noted the United States does not have an official ban on hate speech, as much of it is protected under the First Amendment and hate speech itself is difficult to define.</p>\n<p>“It’s such an amorphous concept. One person’s hate speech is another person’s freedom manifesto,” Creeley said. “It really depends on the eye of the beholder and the ear of the beholder. It is difficult to say what can and cannot be said based on the listener’s reaction.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you want the government to start regulating the content of speech, welcome to fucking Nazi Germany.<br>\n<em>– David Goines</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Goines said the First Amendment was created to protect not only the speech people want to hear, but that which they disagree with.</p>\n<p>“If you want the government to start regulating the content of speech, welcome to fucking Nazi Germany,” Goines said.</p>\n<h2><strong>When Does Free Speech Go Too Far?</strong></h2>\n<p>Controversy surrounds the State Department definition’s proviso on anti-Semitism. Individuals have questioned whether there exists a clear line between criticizing Israel and being anti-Semitic when referencing the Jewish nation state.</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, there is a definitive line between speech that is simply criticizing Israel and speech that is anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>“To be critical of Israel is certainly fine,” Goodman said. “To deny the right of the Jewish people to have the same kind of national rights that any other people have is anti-Semitic.”</p>\n<p>Past Santa Barbara Hillel student president and fourth-year anthropology and global studies double-major Sarah Tagger said the line between criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism should be drawn where people begin to deny the necessity of Israel’s existence.</p>\n<p>“It is fair to discuss Israel’s politics as you would any other country,” Tagger said in an email. “However, when the discussion shifts from possible critiques on Israel’s policies to that of its existence that crosses a line.”</p>\n<p>However, opponents of the definition argue there is no clear line and what they express as constructive criticism of Israel is considered anti-Semitic hate speech by others. Eugene Volokh, who teaches at the UCLA School of Law and has recently covered the Missouri University protests for the Washington Post, said there is no clear definition of anti-Semitism and people will always question whether the criticism of Israel is similar to that leveled against any other country.</p>\n<p>“The overall State Department definition puts people who harshly criticize Israel in a position where they are basically presumed to be anti-Semitic unless their motives are somehow shown to be pure by a comparison of the criticism of Israel with that leveled at other countries,” Volokh said in an email. “But any such comparisons are almost always subjective and highly contestable.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>To be critical of Israel is certainly fine. To deny the right of the Jewish people to have the same kind of national rights that any other people have is anti-Semitic.<br>\n<em>– Rabbi Evan Goodman</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Volokh, people’s criticisms of different countries will vary since the situations each country faces are different.</p>\n<p>“The critics might think that some kinds of criticisms are more effective at changing the behavior of one country than another, or just because many people understandably focus their energies on one conflict rather than trying to learn about and talk about many different conflicts,” Volokh said in an email.</p>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) representative and third-year music studies major Daniel Mogtaderi said there is “danger” in labeling certain criticisms of Israel as anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>“What’s really dangerous about calling the criticism of Israel anti-Semitic is what they’re saying to Jewish students is that any criticism of Israel is criticism of all Jewish people,” Mogtaderi said.</p>\n<p>Mogtaderi said people should feel free to safely criticize Israel and other countries without fear of censorship.</p>\n<p>“To try to limit that by calling it racist, which is basically what anti-Semitism is, is a disservice,” Mogtaderi said. “We should have that space on campus to talk about countries that we don’t agree with the policies of.”</p>\n<h2><strong>The Consequences of Speaking Out?</strong></h2>\n<p>During the UC Board of Regents meeting on Oct. 16, Regent Richard C. Blum stated he and his wife, Democratic California Senator Diane Feinstein, advocate for the UC to adopt a statement on anti-Semitic hate speech and create a set of penalties regulating such speech. According to Blum, Feinstein will publically engage to be “critical” of the UC system if the Regents do not “do the right thing.”</p>\n<p>“Students doing the things that have been cited here today probably should have either a dismissal or suspension from school,” Blum said at the meeting. “I don’t know how many of you feel so strongly that way, but my wife does and I do, too.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, Palestine Legal responded to nearly 300 incidents of alleged accusations of anti-Semitism this year alone, with 85 percent of those incidents targeting students and scholars on over 65 different campuses across the country.</p>\n<p>“Over one third occurred in California. Of the nearly 300 incidents we responded to, 159 involved false accusations of anti-Semitism based solely on speech critical of the Israeli government,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Creeley said enacting the official State Department definition of anti-Semitism would create a “slippery slope” among other minority groups creating their own specialized definition of discrimination against them.</p>\n<p>“If you pass the principles of intolerance and allow students to report other people, then pretty quickly people who are on the pro-Palestinian side of things will report the Jewish students for speech they find hateful against Palestinians,” Creeley said. “Then those Jewish students will be investigated under those same measures that were intended to help them and vice-versa.”</p>\n<p>According to Volokh, adopting the State Department definition will limit academic discussion through microaggressions, subtle but offensive comments or actions directed at a minority or other non-dominant group that often unintentionally or unconsciously reinforce a stereotype.</p>\n<p>“Labeling speech ‘anti-Semitic’ sends a powerful message to faculty members and students, especially ones who weren’t protected under tenure — a message that you had better not express certain views if you want to stay on the administration’s good side,” Volokh said in an email. “That’s a serious blow to academic freedom and to freedom of discourse more generally.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you pass the principles of intolerance and allow students to report other people, then pretty quickly people who are on the pro-Palestinian side of things will report the Jewish students for speech they find hateful against Palestinians.<br>\n<em>– F.I.R.E. attorney Will Creeley</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Creeley, principles against intolerance will encourage students and faculty to report one another to the authorities for “policing” opinions they disagree with.</p>\n<p>“That’s the wrong lesson to teach students and faculty about life in our democracy,” Creeley said. “The answer to speech we don’t like is more speech, not punishment. The better response is to allow a great deal of political speech, which allows truth to arise.”</p>\n<p>Goines said giving the government the ability to regulate free speech, regardless of what topic that speech addresses, is a surrender of one’s valuable free speech rights.</p>\n<p>“The content of speech is not important — it doesn’t matter. It takes power to regulate it, and if you voluntarily give that up because I’m saying something you don’t like, you have given away a very precious right for a small gain.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Who Can Define Hate Speech?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to UCSB religious studies professor Richard Hecht, defining anti-Semitism is the responsibility of the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>“If you were to ask an African American person in the 1960s as to what constitutes racism, they would reject the possibility that the white person has the ability to say, ‘this is racist’ or ‘this is not racist,’” Hecht said. “Ultimately you have to take very seriously the object of hate, which is, in this case, Jews.”</p>\n<p>UCSB student Tagger also said only Jewish students should define the parameters of anti-Semitism at the university.</p>\n<p>“We are continuously shut down and told what is and what is not anti-Semitic. How can everyone else define that for us?” Tagger said in an email. “If we feel that these comments and demonstrations of ‘free speech’ cross boundaries, then we should be heard.”</p>\n<p>UC Student Regent Avi Oved also said it is inappropriate for individuals outside of the Jewish community to define what anti-Semitism is and to dictate how the Jewish community should feel about anti-Semitic activity.</p>\n<p>“We must respect the fact that we can only speak to our own experiences, identities, and respective communities and use this opportunity as a platform for education,” Oved said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Hecht, Israel is closely tied to the religious identity of Jews for various historical reasons.</p>\n<p>“What has happened in the twentieth century is that Israel has become the central component of Jewish life,” Hecht said. “Israel is integrated into Jewish identity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB SJP member Mogtaderi said Israel is not inherently related to Jewish religious identity and thus speech against the policies of Israel as a political entity cannot be considered anti-Semitic.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What has happened in the twentieth century is that Israel has become the central component of Jewish life. Israel is integrated into Jewish identity.<br>\n<em>– UCSB religious studies professor Richard Hecht</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>“Anti-Semitism is something that is against Jewish people for being Jewish. It has nothing to do with the state of Israel,” Mogtaderi said. “We’re criticizing a nation’s policies, not a religion that holds its people’s identity.”</p>\n<p>Palestine Legal attorney Jackson said the term “Israeli” should not be conflated with the word “Jewish,” since approximately 25 percent of Israelis are not Jewish.</p>\n<p>“The state of Israel does not represent all Jews in the world. It does not represent me. I’m Jewish. It is not my homeland and the majority of the global Jewish population does not live in Israel,” Jackson said. “It’s not a Jewish place.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Is This About Divestment?</strong></h2>\n<p>Jackson said the Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement would be considered anti-Semitic under the State Department definition. According to Jackson, advocates are pushing for this definition to purposely undermine the BDS movement.</p>\n<p>“That would have a chilling affect against First Amendment speech,” Jackson said. “There would be many people afraid to engage in the issue at all and that’s the reason why the promoters are trying to adopt it. It’s very obvious.”</p>\n<p>F.I.R.E. Free Speech attorney Creeley said regardless of one’s position on the issue of divestment, the movement is protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“Would the opponents of the divestment movement characterize them as anti-Semitic? Absolutely — I think that would be an almost inevitable result,” Creeley said.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB religious professor Hecht said the activists behind the BDS movement are driven by anti-Semitism and have no interest in providing “legitimate criticism” for the state of Israel.</p>\n<p>“Legitimate criticisms should be made about Israel’s social life and political life and economic life,” Hecht said. “The people who sponsor the BDS movement are not interested in criticism.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The First Amendment is not there to protect the government from you. The First Amendment is there to protect you from the government.<br>\n<em>– David Goines</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) member and second-year Asian American studies and history of public policy double- major Marjan Kris said he believes Israel-aligned activists who label the BDS movement as anti-Semitic are “pulling a card.”</p>\n<p>“If it’s something they don’t like hearing, they’ll say, ‘Oh that’s anti-Semitic,’” Kris said.</p>\n<p>Kris said adopting the State Department definition of anti-Semitism is a violation of the First Amendment and an attempt to block divestment from Israel.</p>\n<p>“How can we move on and progress with limitations that seem to literally render us voiceless?” Kris said. “Speech translates into action. By limiting our free speech, you’re limiting our action. By limiting our action, you’re limiting our movement.”</p>\n<p>At the upcoming UC Board of Regents on Nov. 18 at UC San Francisco, the Regents will further discuss the stance they want to take on the issue of designating certain speech as anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>Former UC Berkeley student Goines argues that all advocates on the issue need to be well-versed on the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“The First Amendment is not there to protect the government from you,” Goines said. “The First Amendment is there to protect you from the government.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66426\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66426\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/the-principles-against-intolerance-attempts-to-redefine-antisemitism-and-the-potential-threat-to-free-speech/","id":2610,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2609,2608,2607],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Revisit I.V.

Stakeholders scheduled specific topics to be discussed at the following meeting through mid-February.</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident and business owner Jay Freeman said he did not like the presentation-oriented structure of the parking meeting. According to Freeman, attendees contested the results of a previous parking survey which found a 15 percent increase in parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was all a power-point presentation format and we all had only three minutes to say what we didn’t like about the parking study,” Freeman said. “Essentially everyone made the argument, ‘well we don’t have any parking spaces even though you found 15 percent parking.’”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdoc said she is concerned about UCSB’s involvement in the suggested parking permit program, and is suspicious the University will push students to pay for campus lots.</p>\n<p>“I feel they have another objective,” Murdoc said. “They want people to pay in their lots or want to make parking expensive enough in Isla Vista that people will use their lots. That concerns me.”</p>\n<p>Field Representative from Williams’ office and UCSB alumnus Cameron Schunk said the SB County Sheriff’s Department will not be responsible for enforcing parking permits in I.V.</p>\n<p>“In our most recent conversation, the Sheriff was not willing to be responsible for the enforcement of a parking permit program in Isla Vista,” Schunk said. “Basically saying we don’t have enough manpower to do it without paying them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65048\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65048\" data-attachment-id=\"65048\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-07/stakeholders-revisit-i-v-self-governance/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444157215\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"140\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65048\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-65048\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Community Organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said issues concerning parking services are complicated.</p>\n<p>“There’s so many different directions we could go with this,” Elliott said. “There’s so many parts of it.

community of Isla Vista is certainly one of the biggest perks of attending UC Santa Barbara. Despite the iconic party scene and the picturesque setting, there are risks that are inevitable in a college town. Daily Nexus sat down with three students from the Associated Students Public Safety Commission to give you the tips you need to have a safe time out on the streets of I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Dwayne Mosbey</strong><br>\n<strong> A.S. Senator and Liaison to the Public Safety Commission Ashcon Minoiefar</strong><br>\n<strong> Former A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Molly Morrison</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What should students be cautious of when going into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> When on the streets or in a party, a simple look around at what is happening can keep you safe, your friends safe and out of trouble with law enforcement. Isla Vista is a friendly and fun place, so it should be enjoyed. But being conscious of what you or your friends are doing will keep you safe, out of jail or getting the infamous MIP (Minor in Possession) … Although it’s an amazing place, Isla Vista unfortunately falls victim to crimes like theft, assault and sexual assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Even though we are in a relatively safe community, be aware of areas with poor lighting and do not engage those who are behaving in an antagonistic manner towards you. When going out be sure to keep track of your drink and never allow anyone to make or give one to you.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What should students do to prepare for potentially dangerous situations?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The easiest way to get yourself into trouble is by not knowing what you or your friends plan on doing. If you’re going to drink and walk DP, which every freshman will understandably do, have a game plan if things don’t work out. Eat some food before, have an idea of where you want to go, have a backup plan if that doesn’t work out (Freebirds nachos are a solid move), and make sure you know where your friends are when you want to head back home. Pouring too many shots back and aimlessly wandering Isla Vista after not getting into any parties is a surefire way to get yourself into some trouble.<br>\nMosbey: When you go out, be sure to have friends accompany you and keep track of each other throughout the night! Familiarize yourself with the local area and as well be aware of the safest routes to take. Be sure to take care of your personal belongings and keep track of them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are some resources that students can access when they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The number-one resource students should be aware of is the CSO Escort program. The number is (805) 893-8000 … Call 911 if you or anyone around you is in any danger, perceived or real. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol can respond to a call very, very quickly and should always be reached out to … Good Samaritan Laws in California provide both the caller and the one in medical need amnesty from prosecution for minor crimes like minor in consumption or drug use. Their priority is getting the person in need of medical attention to the hospital, not citing you a MIP. So don’t hesitate to call.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services is the most valuable resource this campus has for students seeking mental help of any kind, ranging from the most benign forms of stress to other more serious disorders. There should be no stigma associated with wanting to seek help — Counseling and Psychological Services just fought a huge battle against UC budgets to stay a strong force on this campus, and students should really be utilizing this wonderful service more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> Who can students reach out to if they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> Make sure to go to your friends as a support group, no one will be there for you like the friends you meet here at UCSB. Professors can be great help when your course load is getting crazy. Stop by their office hours and you will be amazed how helpful they can be. The SRB [Student Resource Building] has a mind-boggling amount of services. The Womyn’s Center is an amazing resource for many things, including any services pertaining to sexual assault. If you are injured out in Isla Vista or wherever and are having trouble getting to class, check out the Disabled Students Program in the SRB for help.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> When students start to feel that they need help, the most important thing to do is NOT TO STAY QUIET! There are so many people who want to help, and all you have to do is ask. Don’t know where to go? Start with your RA. Don’t have an RA? Walk right into Student Health or Counseling and Psychological Services. No one is judgmental; everyone wants you to do well and BE well.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What do you recommend students bring with them when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Always be sure to have some form of ID when you go out, preferably a state-issued or government ID, as well as a fully charged phone, emergency contact information and your keys (for those who are prone to losing them, buy a carbineer or lanyard.)</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Buddy system. Too often have students wandered off by themselves, and most end up fine, but some have gotten into situations they did not intend, which can have really serious repercussions … When you go out, always carry a form of ID on you … Also bring an open, but grounded mind and heart. Being under any influence may make you more prone to decisions you wouldn’t make otherwise, so make sure to always have your best interests take priority over everything else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are common mistakes made by students, especially freshman or transfers, when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The most common mistake made in Isla Vista is not spacing out your shots or handle pulls. It’s really easy to fill time between conversations with shots. But what we don’t realize until we make this mistake a few times, is that five shots in one hour is a lot. You won’t feel any shots you take for 30 minutes after you take it at the very least, and it’s usually more like an hour. So if you’re not spacing your shots out, you’re gonna have a bad time when it all hits you. Best way to avoid this is to know that saying no to a shot really isn’t that big of a deal … [people] will forget about it in less than a second.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Young adults at this age haven’t fully developed critical decision-making parts of their brain yet, so it’s difficult to figure out if you’re really making the right decision if you are thrust into a neighborhood where there are little to zero authority or parental figures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 6 &amp; 7 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the

id=\"caption-attachment-64716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>University of California Investment Office recently announced it divested nearly $200 million from coal mining and oil companies focused on tar sands while adding sustainability criteria to their investment portfolio.</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UC is a campaign organization comprised of students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members demanding UC divestment from all fossil fuel companies. The announcement to divest came after increased student pressure from a dozen schools following the May oil spill in Santa Barbara, preceded by three years of constant campaigning from Fossil Free UC.  Despite the partial victory, the University of California continues to invest in oil and gas industries involved in processes like the controversial method of hydraulic fracturing.</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UCSB Organizer and global studies graduate Theo LeQuesne said Fossil Free UC is a fossil fuel divestment campaign targeting the top 200 fossil fuel industries, discerned by the amount of carbon dioxide the companies release into the atmosphere. LeQuesne said divesting from the industries forces them to take responsibility for their environmental impact.</p>\n<p>“The reason we are targeting these industries is not necessarily that we think we can financially bankrupt them,” LeQuesne said. “The reason we want to do that is because they have assured themselves not to be responsible in terms of the public interest.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, fossil fuel industries lobby to block legislation targeting climate change, which motivates Fossil Free UC to continue the campaign advocating for divestment.</p>\n<p>“The fossil fuel industry has an enormous lobbying power and it’s really not okay for these people to uphold democracy and the way that politics are going at the moment,” LeQuesne said. “We will continue for divestment and we will be doing that for as long as it takes. We’re not going anywhere.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said the goal of Fossil Free UCSB is to change people’s perspective on the fossil fuel industry by educating the public on the industry’s tactics and impacts in person as well as online through social media.</p>\n<p>“We do this by having conversations with people at the arbor,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a long process, it’s one person at a time. By talking to people we encourage them to come to our meetings and get involved which is really a wonderful thing to see happening on campus.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said another goal is to reinvest the UC’s capital in more sustainable practices.</p>\n<p>“Once divestment occurs you have a lot of capitol to reinvest,” LeQuesne said. “We’re not just pushing for divestment, but putting that capitol to help benefit smaller communities and to help prevent climate change. It requires a different way of thinking of divestment.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, though the oil spill in Santa Barbara last May was damaging to the environment, it also united the UCSB community to demand the UC recognize its responsibility regarding the spill.</p>\n<p>“We had about 75 students demonstrating outside of Chancellor Yang’s office against UC investments,” LeQuesne said. “The UC has investments in Exxon mobile, for example, and Exxon Mobile’s oil was running through that pipeline that burst and endangered a whole bunch of wildlife.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said Fossil Free UCSB has been campaigning for three years and are excited to have won a “partial victory” through student involvement.</p>\n<p>“The recent victory is really testament that you can as a student make a difference through campaigning and activism and that is really exciting to see,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a shame that the recent divestment didn’t result in oil and gas, it was only coal and tar sands. It’s really a matter of time, I believe. It’s not an everyday occurrence.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Isaiah Swauncy said he thinks divestment will help the shift from fossil fuels towards more sustainable alternatives.</p>\n<p>“I think fossil fuels are definitely ruining the environment,” Swauncy said. “I think it’s a great idea and stepping stone for the rest of the U.S. However, until we find another energy source that can sustain the population we can’t completely stop using fossil fuels but the UC can help with divestment.”</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UC leader and UC Berkeley creative writing major Jake Soiffer said it is about time the UC began divesting from fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>“This is a hard-fought victory for students and our allies from across California who have been demanding the UC truly live up to its big talk on climate change,” Soiffer said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64731\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64731\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/","id":2699,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2698,2697,2696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SB County Planning Commission Finds an Increase in I.V.

Students and long-term residents attended the meeting to give input during public comment, all of whom rebutted the survey results. The event ended with the Commission promising to hold another meeting addressing the issue of parking in I.V. to better incorporate the community and for staff to develop a new survey.</p>\n<p>Planning and Development staff member David Lackey said the survey found 34 new parking spots due to elimination of designated red curb areas, new measurements, car share programs and overall reduced total vehicles.</p>\n<p>“It’s a combination of factors that concluded that the overall parking spaces that were available were actually increasing as the capacity has remained the same,” Lackey said.</p>\n<p>Second District SB County Planning Commissioner Cecilia Brown said there has been an increase in student population at UCSB and in I.V. since 2004.</p>\n<p>“But from what I understand, there has been a decrease in vehicles in that community,” Brown said. “Is that a fair statement?”</p>\n<p>Lackey said in terms of a “general trend,” certain demographics such as younger populations are not bringing single personal vehicles in the community.</p>\n<p>“That’s one of the many factors that were identified in the parking survey in 2013,” Lackey said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Associated Students (A.S.) representative Ethan Bertrand said overcrowding I.V. is unsafe and the community’s interests need to be taken into account when looking at I.V.’s future regarding parking.</p>\n<p>“There has been various outreach to the community, but I would say those have been ineffective and I would say we [the community] haven’t been provided with a chance to provide input and consideration to this,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) Chair Pegeen Soutar said IVRPD requests the I.V. Master Plan process be postponed and sent back to the community for review. Soutar also asked that IVRPD to be the lead agency to gather input from the community on all matters related to recreation and parks.</p>\n<p>“Since the Master Plan was first created, we find it to be inconsistent with the active community plan for our parks,” Soutar said. “It is very hard to find parking in Isla Vista at all. As far as your study, we cannot find parking at all. I’m not sure where that 15 percent paring is at folks, but we’re not finding it.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, it is very difficult to find coastal access parking in I.V., especially when people come from out of town for recreational activities.</p>\n<p>“We have excellent surf spots out there,” Soutar said. “And trust me, there are hundreds of people that when the surf is going, they want to come into town and that is a huge problem.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Sue Dickson said she wants amendments for the Master Plan to be postponed because the plan no longer accurately reflects community needs and does not address the density, parking and development issues in the current drought.</p>\n<p>“The Master Plan itself is flawed and out of date,” Dickson said. “A lot of change has taken place in Isla Vista since it has been originally written. Much of the report is no longer relevant. I did not receive any outreach.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Susan Wickham said she was not notified regarding meetings about the I.V. Master Plan.</p>\n<p>“You need to bring the community back into the conversation and let us have an opportunity to acknowledge the changes and the whole plan as it goes through the process,” Wickham said. “I believe the survey needs to be redone.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Maia said I.V. residents are double parking, parking nose to tail with no space in between, parking on dirt lots and in other people’s lots and that land owners are charging for parking.</p>\n<p>“Now it is summer and students are gone mostly. I’ve seen the fewest parking spaces in any of the summers,” Maia said. “There’s no places for visitors to go. This is our personal experience and surveys don’t necessarily reflect that. Why would landlords be charging for parking when there’s lot of spaces?”</p>\n<p>I.V. Project Committee Chair Teddy Warfield said it is not beneficial for those who are not residents of I.V. to create plans for the community.</p>\n<p>“I have to mention the arrogant and high-handed services your county staff has provided for the Isla Vista Master Plan Project and this process,” Warfield said. “I never received any notice that this process was going on. Your staff has served us poorly in this process.”</p>\n<p>UCSB A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs Paola DeLa Cruz said the survey is incorrect; there is no parking in I.V. and apartment complexes charge up to $300 for parking spaces, a fee many students cannot afford.</p>\n<p>“The information that you have in front of you is inaccurate and definitely does not address safety in Isla Vista,” DeLa Cruz said.</p>\n<p>First District SB County Commissioner C. Michael Cooney said community expectations are not being met, particularly concerns of the student body and long-term residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>“As an overall observation, I didn’t hear any support for our actions today,” Cooney said. “We have to emphasize to the Board of Supervisors that we need to look at the overall Master Plan through the eyes of the current Isla Vista, concerned Isla Vista population.”</p>\n<p>Third District SB County Commissioner Joan Hartmann said there needs to be more outreach in I.V. and increased community input to make a “reasonable” decision regarding parking.</p>\n<p>“I think we must ensure that people know what is happening and we need to do a better job. I’d like some assurances,” Hartmann said. “In terms of the parking, what we see here in the survey results is that there is enough parking but according to the community, that is not the case.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/","id":4652,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4651,4650,4649],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Resident Assistants Give First Years Advice","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Huynh.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Huynh.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Balancing college courses and new extracurricular activities is hard enough as it is, but living with one, maybe even two roommates for the first time can add a whole new layer of stress.

studies major Nicole Willard</p></div>\n<p>Their advice:</p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em>: What is the best piece of advice you can give a freshman moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh</em>: Bring only what you need and be mindful that you’re sharing the room. It’s helpful to communicate with your roommate(s) before moving in so you can organize who is bringing what and avoid possibly bringing two fridges!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> “Just do it!!” Shia LaBeouf hits the nail on the head with this statement when it comes to being involved. When you first move in, you will feel intimidated by the whole experience. But don’t coop yourself up in your room! Your dorm intentionally plans many programs the first week of move-in so you can be social and meet new people. You will have such a better experience when you put yourself out there, and you could possibly make lifelong friends! Don’t be afraid to introduce yourself and get to know other people.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki</em>: The best piece of advice I can give to a freshman moving into the dorms is to make an effort to get to know the rest of the people on your floor or building. Some of these people will be your best friends for life. Also, don’t forget to take it all in. Moving into your first college dorm can get pretty overwhelming, but as long as you remain optimistic and hopeful, you can definitely make the most of your time here.</p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What are some things freshmen often forget to pack when moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Get yourself some baby oil! Once you walk along the beautiful beaches of Santa Barbara, you will learn about the sticky tar that is almost impossible to get off of the bottom of your feet. Baby oil does the trick, and it will save you the pain of scrubbing those toes forever!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> Freshmen forget to bring air freshener! Sometimes those rooms get smelly and no one wants to be “that room.” I know a lot of freshmen also forget to bring business attire, for job interviews and such. Last thing, stamps!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What are some belongings freshmen often move in with that won’t be useful?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshmen definitely do not need to bring a printer since UCSB offers 200 free pages a quarter at various printing labs. Check out the free resources your campus offers!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Don’t bring clothes you don’t need! When you go visit your family for breaks, you can switch out clothes for the different seasons. This will give you so much more space for you and your roommates!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen who don’t participate in the “party scene” get involved?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> RAs work really hard to plan programs weekly for residents to who don’t want to party. Residents can suggest ideas and even organize the programs with their RAs. If freshmen want to get involved, there’s SO MANY leadership and volunteer opportunities at UCSB such as Hall Council, RHA, Associated Students and various interest clubs!<br>\n<em>Isozaki:</em> There are plenty of organizations on campus that are excited and welcoming to new first-year members, ranging from activist groups to cultural groups to dance teams to video game clubs. Finding a job is a great way to get work experience, make friends and stay active. It’s also very possible to be involved in the party scene without drinking or doing drugs. The campus climate of UCSB is not about who drinks the most, it’s about having a good time.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki: </em>There is so much you can do. I think there is a strong misconception that every single person parties at UCSB, it’s definitely not true. There are so many student organizations that you can get involved in. If you log onto orgsync.com you can find a huge list of the many clubs and organizations we have on campus. Many of the RAs create programs that will have alternatives to the party scene. You will have many opportunities that will cater to your needs and interests.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen learn to get along with their new roommate(s)?</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is super important to have an open and honest discussion in the first few days you are there. Set some ground rules, and stick to them. There have been too many instances where one roommate doesn’t like something the other roommate is doing so they go ask their RA to fix it for them. When that happens, I don’t intervene until I know they have talked to their roommate about it. Also, being passive aggressive doesn’t work! Don’t do it. If you have a problem, try to be an adult and find a solution yourself. Also, sometimes it is just easier to let the small things go. If you have a mutual understanding and follow the rules you set at the beginning of the year, everything should be fine.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> I think the main thing is just to have respect for one another. Having healthy communication and remaining transparent whenever it is necessary definitely promotes a positive living environment. Try to make an effort to get to know your roommate(s). I suggest to go to programs your RA plans together or find a place to eat in Isla Vista that you both have not tried yet.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What’s a common mistake freshmen often make?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshman should take advantage of the fresh new start that college gives them. They should reach out to others, be open-minded and try new things. The person you were in high school does not have to be the person you are in college. You literally can reinvent yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> Not buying a U-lock for one’s bike! We are a biking campus and having a U-lock helps keep your bike from getting stolen. Also, choose a major based on passion, not pay, because there are so many opportunities in every major to excel in great things.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> Are there any other tips you would like to share with the class of 2019?</p>\n<p><em>Hunyh:</em> Set some academic and personal goals for yourself before starting college. Think about what you really want to achieve by the end of your first year and work towards it! It’s not bad to get lost or go with the flow, but make sure you’re always working towards something great!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is imperative that freshmen learn time management and remember to not put off studying until finals week! Meet your professors and hall directors, go to office hours and don’t be afraid to use all of the campus resources, because they are there for you!</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> Your freshman year goes by so fast!

Interviews led by a panel of three deputies and two community members for the three potential candidates will begin July 23.</p>\n<p>EVPLA Public Safety Director Duncan Calvert said the community members on the panel were not allowed to ask questions, but will be included in the process of choosing the CRD from among the applicants.</p>\n<p>“In creating the questions, we left them vague to allow them to do as much research as they possibly can before attending the interview,” Calvert said. “That really lets us see how their mindset is and how they see policing communities and how it especially ties in with Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said the purpose of the meeting was to develop a general consensus on what qualities are desirable in candidates and to expand on what the CRD position requires to better serve the community.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, I want this conversation to be a part of the larger process of the community resource deputy,” Dela Cruz said. “We want to hear back from what you want from this position so the panel can mention to the candidates that this is what the community needs from you.”</p>\n<p>According to I.V. long-term resident Pegeen Soutar, the CRD officer should be sensitive to the community’s needs. Soutar said an example of this awareness of the uniqueness of I.V. is a case where she saw police officers call in a professional to speak with an intoxicated young man instead of arresting him.</p>\n<p>“You can tell the attitude of the young man changed instantly when he had the chance to talk about his problems,” Soutar said. “And for me, that’s community policing.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said it is up to the community members at these meetings to decide what type of work and how many hours will be dedicated to duties the CRD is responsible for, including attending workshops and trainings.</p>\n<p>“We are the ones who can say, ‘Can you please come to this workshop or this training in diversity?’” Dela Cruz said. “It really is up to us to decide what this individual will be doing in the community.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said due to discrimination laws, the phrase “bilingual preferred” could not be included in the job description because the ability to fluently speak a language is considered a skill.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64315\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64315\" data-attachment-id=\"64315\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-20/i-v-community-resource-deputy-search-to-attract-genuine-applicants/crd_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1125&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1125\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1437068625\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"110\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CRD_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64315\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x576.jpg?resize=600%2C338\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-64315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I discussed it with [I.V. Foot Patrol] Lieutenant [Rob] Plastino, and that is something you are not allowed to put on,” Dela Cruz said. “But if it came down that — all the candidates had the same amount of experience — and that made one stand out in particular, he would choose that person.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Cooperative Manager Melissa Cohen said the nature of the CRD position will attract applicants who “genuinely” want to help the community and are not just applying for a small salary raise.</p>\n<p>“It takes a certain type of person to even apply for this position,” Cohen said. “I think we can hold hope that there will be people who got into police work because they feel strongly about this. Our lieutenant feels quite strongly about it.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office volunteer Chaplain Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said he agrees the officers who apply for the CRD position are those who want to improve the community.</p>\n<p>“Those who stepped up to the table are those who want to be here,” Hedges said. “They will definitely take some heat from their coworkers who would not step up for this kind of thing.”</p>\n<p>Calvert said he hopes the CRD will make committees and teams to help address different issues in I.V., especially those between students and police.</p>\n<p>“There is a disconnect between students and the police force,” Calvert said. “The more interaction we can get between the two will alleviate a lot of the bad things that happen and will help build a stronger community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

University United Methodist Church co-hosted a walk and special service Sunday afternoon to honor the victims of the Charleston Shooting and to advocate for reduced gun violence.</p>\n<p>Participants gathered at People’s Park in Isla Vista to listen to guest speakers before walking down Sueno Road to the University United Methodist Church. A candlelight vigil was held at the church with speakers and live music in remembrance of the nine lives lost in the Charleston Shooting on June 17 and the six lives lost in I.V. in the events of May 23 last year. Guest speakers included state legislators, city officials and the parents of May 23 victims Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss.</p>\n<p>Richard Martinez, father of Christopher Michaels-Martinez and senior outreach associate for Everytown for Gun Safety, said 88 Americans are shot and killed every day with hundreds more wounded in homes, schools, churches, stores and streets.</p>\n<p>“Today we accept that gun violence can happen at any time, any place and to anyone in America,” Martinez said. “It happened to my family and it can happen to yours. I am here today for my son, Christopher, who was shot and killed near here just over a year ago.”</p>\n<p>Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America Team Leader Emily Heckman said the purpose of the Sunday’s event was to “lift each other up.”</p>\n<p>“We want to pray together for the safety of our children, for the sorrows and deep compassion for our community and for the wisdom and courage of our elected officials to take the next action,” Heckman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider said America’s collective inability to keep history from repeating itself is “disheartening.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen tragedy unfold again and again,” Schneider said. “The second amendment and common sense legislation that would have prevented a lot of these tragedies by stopping mentally ill and convicted criminals from accessing firearms are not mutually exclusive.”</p>\n<p>State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson said she remembers the assassinations of Former President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and has not seen significant improvement in gun regulation since.</p>\n<p>“This was decades ago,” Jackson said. “I am very old, and this problem is not getting better.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64216\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"896488250\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64225\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64216\" data-attachment-id=\"64216\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-29/walk-church-service-promote-anti-gun-violence-movement/charlestonwalk_by-lorenzo-basilio-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1435502118\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"95\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CharlestonWalk_by Lorenzo Basilio-15\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64216\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15-1024x684.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64216\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Jackson, acts of violence related to firearm use can be avoided.</p>\n<p>“We talk about mental illness, we talk about hate,” Jackson said. “These are things that live in all societies. But they don’t get to demonstrate themselves the way they do in our country because not everybody has access to a firearm just because they want one.”</p>\n<p>According to Assemblymember Das Williams, gun violence is one of the biggest causes of death among young people in America, behind car accidents and overdoses.</p>\n<p>“We need to, more than anything, keep ourselves and our society from complacency,” Williams said. “If we really want to keep our youth safe, we need to tackle the issues of gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said opponents to increased gun regulation told him background checks did not save his son.</p>\n<p>“Does that mean background checks are a failure and not worth doing? No,” Martinez said. “Seat belts in cars don’t prevent death from accidents 100 percent of the time, but that doesn’t mean we should stop using them. Seat belts save a significant number of lives … We need to improve California’s background check system to prevent the seriously mentally ill from having guns.”</p>\n<p>In the 17 states that require firearm background checks, 46 percent fewer women are shot and killed by their partners, 48 percent fewer on-duty police officers are shot and killed, 48 percent fewer people commit suicide with guns and there is 40 percent less gun trafficking, according to Schneider.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing society can do to reduce gun violence is to require a criminal background check on firearm sale,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, individuals in opposition to gun regulation question why knives are not being focused on because three of the victims of the events of May 23 last year died of knife injuries. Martinez said a gun has “vastly” more power than any knife.</p>\n<p>“The handgun that killed Veronika Weiss could fire more than 40 bullets in one minute” Martinez said. “At the time the Isla Vista shooter died, he had more than 500 bullets left and his gun could fire as fast as he could pull the trigger.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he co-authored Assembly Bill (AB) 1014 with Assemblymember Nancy Skinner to allow for a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) to be signed by a judge to temporarily prohibit a person from owning, purchasing or possessing firearms if the individual has been proven by law enforcement or a loved one to being a danger to themselves or others.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, we shouldn’t be having mentally unstable people having possession of firearms,” Williams said. “Laura’s law is a powerful tool about incorporating mental illness, and I’m pleased that Santa Barbara is looking into it.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she authored Senate Bill 347 which adds dealing in firearms without a license, petty theft involving a firearm, selling ammunition to someone under 21 and bringing or carrying ammunition onto school grounds to the existing list of misdemeanors prohibiting individuals from being able to purchase or possess a firearm for 10 years.</p>\n<p>“A number of crimes are associated with firearm-related misdemeanors,” Jackson said. “We know these people are more likely to use firearms and we know that we need to take those guns away from them moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Schneider said even though 94 percent of American citizens are in support of gun regulation, special interests groups such as the National Rifle Association (NRA) are still a big obstacle to passing gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“A large part of the problem is on the national level where special interests groups block any debate to keep politicians bound to some sense of ideological purity,” Schneider said. “When that happens our citizens are not served.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she believes the Charleston Shooting was clearly an act of hatred.</p>\n<p>“It is flamed by groups who unapologetically feel that they are the only ones who have truth and justice by their side,” Jackson said. “And we know they are wrong, and they should not be able to determine the fates of other people.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64213\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

The evening ended with long-term I.V. houseless resident Clyde performing Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth” on the guitar.</p>\n<p>Hedges said while many people think of houselessness as an abstract problem, it is actually an issue made up of individuals.</p>\n<p>“They are not a population,” Hedges said. “They are persons who you can meet and know by name and by stories, not by what group they’re a part of.”</p>\n<p>Anyone can become houseless given unfavorable circumstances, according to Hedges.</p>\n<p>“In a blink, any one of us can become homeless,” Hedges said. “We’ve seen it happen. A house burned and that family becomes homeless. During the landslide, a lot of those folks became homeless for a while.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while nonprofit organizations need to create opportunities for houseless people, they should not try to “fix” them.</p>\n<p>“We stepped in and gave them [houseless people] a key to provide opportunity and advocacy to get their lives back together,” Hedges said. “They take it upon themselves to better their lives.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said houseless people have died in I.V. this past year, specifically his friend, Little Rick, who passed away after struggling with addiction and depression.</p>\n<p>“He ended up dying behind that … liquor store in Isla Vista,” Hedges said. “He drank himself to near death then died of hypothermia that night. He had no will to live, and it broke my heart.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said people need to stop stigmatizing houselessness because it creates a “self-fulfilling” cycle.</p>\n<p>“There’s a set of characteristics homeless people have — low self-esteem, difficulty holding a job, etcetera,” Rawlings said. “If you tell them they can’t make it or they’re inferior or can’t do certain things, they will lose the motivation to try.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said society’s conceptions on homelessness do not reflect the root of the problem.</p>\n<p>“We carry in our heads bullshit of how the world really works,” Rawlings said. “What is true and what is legitimization — stories we tell ourselves that makes us feel better about the world.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said common ideas on houselessness often underestimate the influence of economic and social forces.</p>\n<p>“Poverty is seen an individual problem — people are poor because they don’t work hard. They’re not the toughest of the lot, but that’s not true,” Rawlings said. “The basis of these B.S. theories on inequality is through an overemphasis on being individuals.”</p>\n<p>Common Ground Santa Barbara Volunteer Coordinator Stephen Gruver said houselessness is much harder than perceived.</p>\n<p>“You end up filling out dozens of paperwork to apply for anything, and people say homeless people are just getting free handouts, which may be true, but they’re working hard to get even the simplest things,” Gruver said. “I want to change the stigma that being homeless is easy.”</p>\n<p>Longtime Santa Barbara county houseless resident Jim said he wishes meetings like Houseless Awareness Night were more frequent.</p>\n<p>“I’m grateful it happens in the first place, it’s a good step in the right direction, but more needs to be done,” Jim said. “Only an hour and a half can’t even begin to explain what we go through every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Jim, being houseless in Isla Vista is like living in a “war zone.”</p>\n<p>“At night we get this breeze from Alaska that will be like 10 degrees — you can die of hypothermia,” Jim said. “The kids don’t care and will run over you with bikes and you’re constantly living in a state of fear from being attacked or mugged or raped by anyone. The people here don’t give a damn about us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

of Malware” in the Pacific View Room tonight at 4 p.m. as part of the Davidson Library’s Pacific Views: Library Speaker Series.</p>\n<p>Vigna is the co-founder and CTO of Lastline, co-director of the Security Lab and director of the Center for CyberSecurity at UCSB. Vigna’s talk on malware, short for malicious software, will discuss research being developed to fight cybercriminals who quickly adapt to countermeasures being deployed in cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, the lecture will focus on four key questions: “What is malware?,” “How does it operate?,” “How does it affect us?” and “How can the average person protect themselves?”</p>\n<p>“Everyone is susceptible to malware,” Vigna said. “If you’re on the Internet you will be attacked one way or another and it’s important to know how it works.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said the damage caused by malware varies in strength but can create major repercussions, especially for students.</p>\n<p>“Malware can steal personal information, like your bank info, and sell it in the underground market for money,” Vigna said. “They could encrypt your files and ask for a ransom. If you do not have a backup you will not be able to get your files back, which can be especially troublesome for students who may have a project or a big paper due the next day.”</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, writing malware is as difficult as coding any other computer program, varying in strength and complexity depending on the developer’s experience.</p>\n<p>“It takes skill when you want do something very sophisticated that hides its presence very well,” Vigna said. “There is very simple malware … and there is other sophisticated malware that goes deep into the operating system.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said that protecting against malware is a competition between defense and attacker because the superior program comes out on top.</p>\n<p>“You’re against another person trying to make your stuff work against his; it is a battle against one another,” Vigna said. “It’s an arms race.”</p>\n<p>Vigna also said malware changes at a rapid rate because it, and the products developed to detect it, is continuously evolving.</p>\n<p>“We come out with new techniques to detect malware and they’ll come out with new techniques from our techniques, and we have to come out with new way to find theirs,” Vigna said. “It’s continued evolution.”</p>\n<p>First-year film and media studies major Andrew Okeh said students should take cybersecurity classes in high school because they depend on computers now more than generations before them.</p>\n<p>“With this increase in computer use it would be wise to implement basic ‘safe online behavior classes,’ like how we learn about having safe sex,” Okeh said. “I mean it is 2015! Practices like installing anti-malware software, updating computers, not using random networks or downloading stuff from sketchy websites.”</p>\n<p>Second-year computer science major Dylan Lynch said he is interested in attending Vigna’s talk because cyber security is relevant to anyone who uses the Internet.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited to attend the talk because I think computer security is growing to be a really lucrative field,” Lynch said. “It’s very relevant because of all the companies people trust with their personal information.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Walk a Mile in Her Shoes began in 2001 in Northern California and has since grown into a worldwide movement, with tens of thousands of men donning heels to demonstrate the importance of the cause.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sexual assault is more than just a ‘Greek’ issue. It is a human issue. Even one case of sexual assault is one too many … – Sigma Pi Herald Austen Mauch</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year biology major Kevin Duong said he hopes the event will help alleviate the negative image of fraternities contributing to rape culture on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“I loved this event. My high school took part in walks every semester and seeing it take place in college is an absolutely amazing sight,” Duong said. “We, as fraternity men, want to work with the community to benefit everybody and having the thought of ‘Oh, X fraternity is prone to sexual violence against women’ leads to adversity in our mission.”</p>\n<p>According to Sigma Pi Herald and third-year biology and economics double major Austen Mauch, the UCSB Greek community stands against sexual violence and is actively trying to reverse the negative stigma surrounding fraternities and rape culture.</p>\n<p>“Sadly, I do know that statistically 1 in 6 women are a victim of sexual assault, every two minutes someone in America is raped and 1 in 4 college-age women will be sexually assaulted during their time in school,” Mauch said. “Sexual assault is more than just a ‘Greek’ issue. It is a human issue. Even one case of sexual assault is one too many … We wanted to bring this issue to the forefront of everyone’s mind so together, everywhere, we can change the violent culture we unfortunately see today.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said UCSB is not the only university where sexual violence occurs and that altering people’s perspectives can be a first step toward changing the campus environment.</p>\n<p>“Many people do not understand the struggle that others have to endure,” Mauch said.  “By taking the opportunity to walk in someone else’s shoes maybe we can begin to understand what others are subjected to … Until everyone, every brother and sister, son and daughter, mother and father, friend and neighbor, can walk alone with no fear of sexual violence we haven’t done enough. Until everyone can go anywhere at any time without fear of sexual violence we have not done enough.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If even only one person we saw walking down Pardall changed how they saw fraternities here at UCSB, we did a fantastic job and should continue to push our solidarity for the safety and comfort of women in similar ways. – Third-year biology major Kevin Duong</p></blockquote>\n<p>Duong said the event was successful if even one person changed his or her opinion on fraternities.</p>\n<p>“One thing to note is that sometimes events like these don’t feel like it was ‘successful’ but in my eyes, even if one person was swayed to change their opinion then it was successful,” Duong said. “If even only one person we saw walking down Pardall changed how they saw fraternities here at UCSB, we did a fantastic job and should continue to push our solidarity for the safety and comfort of women in similar ways.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said while it was difficult walking in high heels, this was his favorite part of the event because it allowed him to better relate to those who choose to wear them.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely an eye-opening experience,” Mauch said. “It was incredibly difficult and tiring and made me truly appreciate what women and men go through when choosing to wear heels. I believe the event went very well, and through our constant chanting on the walk of ‘listen, believe, support’ definitely drew most people’s attention and hopefully inspired some inquiry into sexual violence awareness and prevention.”</p>\n<p>According to Duong, the students participating in the walk received positive support from bystanders as they marched through I.V. toward Embarcadero Hall.</p>\n<p>“My favorite part was actually when we started entering I.V. past the Pardall Tunnel and our entire group started chanting, ‘listen, believe, support’ while doing our walk,” Duong said. “It showed that we not only were men who could change our footwear for a mile, but that we were willing to, as a collective, voice our concerns for the women in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said by attending the event, participants made a promise not to be passive bystanders when it comes to preventing sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“They were pledging to stop sexual violence, and that any and every time they see anything questionable anywhere, they will not stand idle,” Mauch said. “We need the culture to change. We need everyone to speak out, stand up and not let the violence continue.”</p>\n<p>According to Kappa Sigma Grand Master Guillermo “Memo” Llamas, the event went through multiple stages of planning.</p>\n<p>“Preparing the event required filling out forms, reserving the plaza, making posters and signs, and spreading the word to invite as many individuals as possible to the event,” Llamas said. “Leading up to the event there were several educational workshops geared towards improving sexual violence awareness.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said his fraternity chose to host Walk a Mile in Her Shoes to fulfill the community service requirement which all Sigma Pi chapters must complete because he thought it could make a significant impact.</p>\n<p>“The high heels were supposed to symbolize the struggles of women and anyone who identifies as a woman,” Mauch said. “Having a group not accustomed to the struggles of women would have an opportunity to walk a mile from their perspective. It’s the best way for more individuals to begin to understand some of the struggles that women face.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-19/fraternity-brothers-walk-a-mile-in-heels/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-19/fraternity-brothers-walk-a-mile-in-heels/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-19/fraternity-brothers-walk-a-mile-in-heels/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-19/fraternity-brothers-walk-a-mile-in-heels/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-19/fraternity-brothers-walk-a-mile-in-heels/","id":2798,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2797,2796,2795],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Arbor Mural Assembled","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students for Justice in Palestine erect mobile mural, sparking West Bank, Gaza Strip debate","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Students for Justice in Palestine erect mobile mural, sparking West Bank, Gaza Strip debate</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_62221\" style=\"width: 668px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62221\" data-attachment-id=\"62221\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/new-arbor-mural-assembled/the-wall_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428481197\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Wall_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C365&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62221\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=658%2C400\" alt=\"Originally assembled at UCI in 2012, the mural has been transferred to and displayed on college campuses as far as UC Berkeley and Arizona State University.

The wall seeks to encourage discussion on the Palestine/Israel conflict, though some students have expressed concerns it does not represent multiple viewpoints.<em> Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) constructed a mural wall in the Arbor on Monday to remain until tomorrow that displays artwork and messages illustrating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the West Bank and Gaza Strip region.</p>\n<p>The wall was originally constructed by SJP at UC Irvine in 2012 and has since been transferred to multiple university campuses, including UC Berkeley, UC Merced, Stanford, Arizona State University and the Claremont Colleges, to promote a UC resolution to divest from companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Palestine/Israel. The Associated Students External Affairs Committee will consider this campus’s divestment resolution at its 6 p.m. meeting today after tabling the proposal at its meeting last week.</p>\n<p>Second-year music major and SJP member Daniel Moltke said the wall was built in order to spark discussion among the campus community about the ongoing conflict in the West Bank and Gaza as well as to inform interested students on the current divestment resolution.</p>\n<p>“We want them to know there is this divestment campaign happening these weeks and that the vote will hopefully be happening Wednesday,” Moltke said. “Our main objective is to spread awareness and let people know that there’s something we can do about it and something we can do about it right now.”</p>\n<p>Third-year history major and SJP member Aaron Reveles said the wall travels to different campuses each spring quarter or semester in order to educate UC students statewide about the UC’s financial holdings in corporations such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard, which all allegedly profit from Israeli government policies in the Palestine/Israel region.</p>\n<p>“This is a communal wall that travels to different campuses,” Reveles said. “We drove down to the last school it was at, which was Pitzer College in [Pomona], with a U-Haul truck we rented out. A group of us worked hard and put it together.”</p>\n<p>According to Moltke, the UC divestment campaign regarding Palestine/Israel reflects a similar past UC resolution calling on an end to apartheid in South Africa.</p>\n<p>“There’s people that were big in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, who mentioned specifically the UC’s divesting was a significant part in the turnaround of their movement,” Moltke said. “So we hope that by getting all of the UC’s on the same page, we can get the regents to stop funding these corporations that perpetuate violence and oppression.”</p>\n<p>However, first-year economics major Jack Tannenbaum said while he believes the wall facilitates political discussion, its messages do not represent multiple perspectives.</p>\n<p>“I’m so happy I’m on a campus like UCSB that facilitates free speech,” Tannenbaum said. “I think that it’s great this wall is up and that it’s starting political discourse. But I really wish … that there had been some form of collaboration, or this wall had shown two sides of the story … I believe it really, really does not.”</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum also said the campaigns associated with the wall represent an “affront” to Jewish self-determination.</p>\n<p>“On this board it says Zionism equals racism … the general definition of Zionism is the belief in having a nation for the Jewish people free from persecution with the right of self-determination,” Tannenbaum said. “Saying that idea is racism — the existence of a Jewish state is racism — personally affronts my belief in the idea that I can have a place as a Jew where I am free from persecution.”</p>\n<p>According to Moltke, despite the presence of the wall, Palestinian students often feel victimized and afraid to voice their opinions at public forums due to potentially consequential future circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There are Palestinians who are afraid to speak at these public meetings because someone pro-Israel can record them and send it to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],” Moltke said.</p>\n<p>Moltke said SJP student groups across the UC feel compelled to display the wall and spark discussion among students because of the challenges Palestinians face expressing free speech abroad.</p>\n<p>“The Israeli government won’t let you into Palestine if you’re pro-divestment or anti-Israel. There are no airports in Palestine so you have to go through Israel and if students speak out,” Moltke said, “they may never get to see their families in Palestine. So it’s up to us to get the word out.”</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Hannah Ellenhorn however said she does not agree with the wall and its illustrations supporting divestment, and believes that the resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in the Palestine/Israel area is anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>“At the core of the conflict is a refusal for Arab populations to recognize the right of Jewish self-determination in Judea and Samaria,” Ellenhorn said. “The recent move for college campuses to boycott Jewish-owned businesses based in Israel is nothing more than blatant Jew-hatred masked in a degenerate view of social justice.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year computer engineering major Nader Khalil, however, United States’ corporations should cut funding to companies profiting from human rights violations everywhere in the world, no matter who the perpetrators or victims are.</p>\n<p>“Human rights on all scales are important,” Khalil said. “I see the West Bank Settlements as an issue. There is hate from both sides. A practical solution would be to cut American funding of these Israeli settlements and other war crimes that were committed on Gaza.

Crawford gave a lecture on modern technology and the mind Tuesday night in Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>Hosted by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, Crawford’s talk, “The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming an Individual in an Age of Distraction,” discussed a phenomenon called the “crisis of attention,” which explores the distractive capabilities of modern day technology and reliance on social media for purposes of comfort and confidence. Crawford’s goal is to convince individuals, particularly youth, to be more aware of their surroundings and less consumed by technological distractions such as television and cellular devices.</p>\n<p>According to Crawford, societal pressures exist that encourage people to stay up-to-date with trends and popular entertainment as opposed to such topics such as classic literature. Crawford said engrossment with modern technology has been “normalized.”</p>\n<p>“I’d be sitting down on my comfortable couch about to read Plato and rediscover my love for complex philosophy,” Crawford said. “I would read a few pages, realize that my favorite TV show is on, so I switch on the TV and now I’m not a societal freak and can talk to some people about it. If I just read Plato and tried to talk to someone about the next day, they’d think I was a bit of a freak.”</p>\n<p>Crawford said ‘”distractibility” is facilitated by technology and provides a colorful, attractive world as opposed to a dull world without the distractions.</p>\n<p>“The more we delve into these distractions, whether it be Facebook or Candy Crush or whatnot, we start to view the normal world as more bland and tasteless,” Crawford said. “It doesn’t offer the same amount of fun and entertainment that your marshmallow treat phone application has. So then we get hungry for it, and we go running back to our phones.”</p>\n<p>Crawford also said self-esteem and sense of worth is tied to the attention users of social media get on social media sites.</p>\n<p>“To be distracted is to be entertained and awed by all these fake experiences,” Crawford said. “Our self-dignity depends on social media which then creates a fragile self, which makes us dependent on constructed experiences to make up for it.”</p>\n<p>Goleta resident Michael Jung said as a teacher he often encountered students who were unable to detach themselves from technology and relied on phone applications to solve problems.</p>\n<p>“I taught high school [trigonometry] and I just couldn’t believe how many kids would just sit and play on their phones if I left them alone,” Jung said. “One girl even asked why we need to learn math if there’s ‘an app for that.’ To be educated, that’s why!”</p>\n<p>Jung also said he found it refreshing to see young people take interest in activities and experiences other than technology.</p>\n<p>“When I see people actually take an interest in other things — traditional art, music, dancing — I feel better,” Jung said. “I know technology hasn’t consumed every part of their life.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Margaret Rhiner said she believes youth need to be reminded to enjoy their physical environment and interact with people around them.</p>\n<p>“They don’t realize it anymore, or maybe they’re just numb to their surroundings,” Rhiner said. “I go to the beach and I’m baffled to see all these kids on their phones instead of admiring the water or playing in the sand. Young people don’t talk to people anymore and they’re all obsessed about the next big invention.”</p>\n<p>Crawford said students should take advantage of campus and its surrounding scenery while they still have the opportunity.</p>\n<p>“If you’re a UCSB student, you’re living on the edge of the Pacific Ocean,” Crawford said. “You will never, ever, live anyplace like this again. I mean, unless you’re a billionaire or something. I think of a 20-year-old walking on the beach with his head stuck in Facebook and it just breaks my heart. Live a little. It’s worth it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62134\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62134\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/","id":2845,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2844,2843,2842],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lecture Talks About Reintroducing Extinct Animals","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Conservation-Talk_Brendan-Mansfield-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Conservation-Talk_Brendan-Mansfield-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) hosted a talk on the possibilities of resurrecting extinct life by Oliver A.

Ryder, Director of the San Diego Zoo’s Frozen Zoo Project and Chair of the Zoo’s Institute for Conservation Research, delivers a talk on reviving extinct species.<em> Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) hosted a talk on the possibilities of resurrecting extinct life by Oliver A. Ryder titled “Conservation, De-Extinction, and the Future of Life” in the HSSB McCune Conference Room on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Ryder is the Director of the Frozen Zoo Project at the San Diego Zoo’s Institute for Conservation Research, a project that freezes cell samples and DNA from over half a million endangered organisms in an effort to save species coming close to extinction.</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, there is increased global concern for conservation and he is disappointed in the United States’ lack of participation in international conservation treaties.</p>\n<p>“The international community is making goals to provide standards and higher expectations to express these problems on a global basis,” Ryder said. “Our country is one of the great minority in the world that has not participated in the discussion since we did sign the Convention [on] Biological Diversity. We have a major role to play in the involvement of these discussions one way or another.”</p>\n<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity is a multilateral international treaty signed in 1992 by over 150 countries across the world pledging a commitment to ensure conservation of biological diversity within their borders. As of 2014, the U.S. has signed but not ratified the conditions of the 1992 agreement.</p>\n<p>Ryder said the now extinct Hawaiian po’o-uli bird was been studied in the Frozen Zoo Project using cells of the bird from previously acquired genetic samples.</p>\n<p>“[The Po’ouli bird] is a real just a tragic story and a prime example of dysfunction,” Ryder said. “However we were able to receive some DNA of the species before the bird died and we were able to grow some living cells out of it. It was a surreal experience. How the cells are growing vivaciously and seeing the chromosomes being created and just knowing the organism is gone.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, in 1987 conservationists counted the amount of California Condors and found a shockingly low total population of about 20 birds. Participants took samples of and tagged each individual bird and found they were struggling to survive due to lead pollution, according to Ryder who participated in the project.</p>\n<p>“We used DNA fingerprinting on 23 condors and found each Condor to only three clans and found they have a genetic disease, like a lethal dwarfism that prevented chicks from hatching, resulting from lead in the environment,” Ryder said. “As a result of that, Governor Brown signed a bill banning lead bullets, but California is the only state to do this even though the condor is present in Arizona and Utah.”</p>\n<p>Ryder said one of the biggest success stories is of the black-footed ferret, which was thought to have been extinct but reappeared in Wyoming in 1981. Seven of the ferrets brought to captivity reproduced successfully using artificial semen, a process that increases genetic diversity.</p>\n<p>“Currently, all 8,000 ferrets in captivity came from seven individuals,” Ryder said. “We received skin biopsies samples from ferrets who were alive earlier to create artificial semen. The semen was then used on the seven individuals who gave birth to ferrets that now have more genetic diversity, which will help the overall survival of the black footed ferret species.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, the only way to help increase genetic diversity of endangered animals is by cloning, which he considers an expensive procedure.</p>\n<p>“Cloning is the only way to do it,” Ryder said. “However this is used as a model for cystic fibrosis research. There are ferrets who are given the gene for the human form of cystic fibrosis that are then used as test subjects for medication treatment. They can take the ferret cell but it costs about $50,000 to $150,000.”</p>\n<p>Ryder said the San Diego Zoo is attempting to use Frozen Zoo Project samples to save the only five remaining northern white rhinoceros, but that saving the animals will not be enough to save the species if the rhinos do not breed.</p>\n<p>“We took some cells from one of the rhinos and grew stem cells from them, which can make any cells in the body,” Ryder said. “Theoretically we can save the white rhinos, however the rhinos aren’t repopulating. There are five walking around, but if there is no offspring, they might as well be extinct already.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, future generations are raised with notions of potentially saving endangered species, and must decide the future of manipulating genomes.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to watch movies like ‘Ice Age’ because it assaults everything we know about DNA and genes, but this is the world our children are growing up in,” Ryder said. “They’re growing up believing this is possible, and it might be, but it’s up to them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Bree Brydenthal said she believes scientists need to work purposefully when conducting research and should consider whether their work will benefit the community.</p>\n<p>“I think the question that has to be asked is what is the point of them branching out to bring these animals into a world we don’t need them in,” Brydenthal said. “Is it beneficial to our current ecosystem or will it have serious environmental consequences? I think we have to determine what place it will have.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Brianna Acuesta said freezing samples could lead to moral debates among researchers and the general public.</p>\n<p>“In terms of morality, it’s the issues that come up of this topic,” Acuesta said. “People are talking about cloning or bringing back animals that necessarily don’t have a place in our world right now. But also we’re not talking about mammoths, we’re talking about species such as the passenger pigeon too.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62032\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62032\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/","id":2838,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2837,2836,2835],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/143"}},"__N_SSG":true}
