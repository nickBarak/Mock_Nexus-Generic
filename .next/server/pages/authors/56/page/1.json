There’s no doubt that that’s going to be part of everybody’s career in the next 10 to 20 years,” Dowd said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not just enough to know how to program, to incorporate data; you really need to have an understanding of what you’re trying to achieve with that data. And that takes some creativity, some critical thinking skills,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After graduating from UCSB, Dowd began his career at Barclays Global Investors in San Francisco. Each time he was promoted, however, Dowd said he was reminded of how little he knew about finance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to his lack of knowledge of the field, Dowd was motivated to continue his education at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business to obtain an MBA in finance and accounting. It was there that he discovered the value of an interdisciplinary education in today’s tech-driven economy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really started to appreciate how important data analysis and technology will be going forward in solving problems — not just financial problems, but world problems,” Dowd said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s kind of where I got this idea that we should probably all start incorporating data analysis and technology in how we think about the world and how we creatively solve problems using the tools available to all of us,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Majewski, dean of humanities and fine arts at UCSB and largely involved in the program’s development, feels the Creative Computing Initiative will benefit university graduates as they enter the professional field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With automation and artificial intelligence poised to remake the economy, employment experts expect far-reaching changes in jobs and employment,” Majewski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Majewski feels that skills such as “research experience, communication skills, intellectual empathy, mental flexibility and systems thinking,” all common in the humanities, are crucial for maximum productivity across a variety of fields, including technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Distinguished alumni in the high-tech industry … often point out that their ability to effectively communicate with different groups — whether programmers, consumers or corporate executives — has been critical in their career success,” Majewski said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ability to understand the viewpoints of others, to communicate effectively and to think creatively about problems seem to be in high demand in technology and other industries,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the program’s courses are still in the development stage, students should eventually expect to find classes on topics ranging from computer programming to artificial intelligence — all geared toward humanities students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is going to be invaluable in the next 20 years for kids to, on the one hand, develop critical thinking skills, and on the second hand, be able to understand where technology is headed and utilize that as a great tool,” Dowd said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 3, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> print edition. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

When I first came to UCSB, I didn’t really like it here, and being in the residential community was something that really changed that for me,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Voss said she recognized the importance of RHA’s primary focus on event planning and management, she felt that the association could further expand its supply of resources for residents by providing more professional and academic opportunities in the dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to have safe, alternative events that people can go to. But I also think that’s not what makes living in the dorms better. I think what makes living in the dorms better is having different kinds of facilities, opportunities and resources that you don’t get off campus,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these insights in mind, Voss ran for RHA president against incumbent </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kyle Bates</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in spring  2018 and won.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came into the position this year not necessarily knowing what I was getting myself into. I knew that I loved RHA’s mission, and I loved the fact that we get to do work that’s so personal and intimate,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Voss’s biggest goals this past year was working on the expansion of professional and academic resources for residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is currently implementing a series of workshops focused on event planning and management. The workshops would teach students the basics of event planning, from making room reservations to funding requests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her presidency, Voss prioritized building connections with offices such as Residential and Community Living (RNCL) and Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE). She said that she noticed a disconnect between these entities and residents and took it upon herself to become an intermediary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not that these offices don’t care about these issues, it’s that they don’t know about them. Their offices are separate from students, and they don’t really employ students in their offices,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss explained that higher entities are often uninformed about everyday residential issues such as laundry malfunctions. She feels that by maintaining stronger channels of communication between these offices and RHA, these problems can be solved more efficiently and effectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m someone who’s not really afraid to stand up and advocate for students, and I’m not someone who’s going to say I’m going to do something and then not do it. For me that has to do with going into a conversation with these offices with a really clear plan of exactly what I’d like to do,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is also committed to seeking creative, alternative sources for funding when entities like RNCL are not equipped to fund certain programs. This includes applying for grants from the Zero Waste Committee and seeking funds from other organizations on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we do have great sources of funding as RHA, I’m definitely willing to look to other resources if we can’t fulfill the kinds of things that I think are important to students through those resources,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As RHA president, Voss attended </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PACURH (Pacific Affiliate of College and University Residence Halls) housing conferences at UCLA and Southern Oregon University in November</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fifty schools from the Pacific Region, which includes California, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington and Oregon, were invited to the conference.. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss said the money for conferences came entirely from fundraising and not student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss also created “Resources with RHA,” a program that distributes hundreds of free midterm materials in the residence halls every quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She  is also working with several members of RHA to create a new position in Hall Councils next year: an International Student Engagement Chair. The position will work closely with the Office of International Student Services (OISS) to ensure adequate resources and opportunities for international students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After completing her first year as RHA president, Voss decided to run again in an effort to accomplish her longer-term goals and projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constant changes in leadership affect the productivity of student government each year, Voss said. This problem is especially pertinent for RHA, she added, since living in the residence halls is a requirement of being in the organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every single year RHA is completely different than the previous year, and very few of the projects are long-lasting,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss took 63% of the vote in this year’s RHA elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I can take a lot of things I’ve done this year and make it even better for next year in a way that leaves a stronger foundation for the next RHA,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited for the fact that in RHA we really have the agency to accomplish a lot of wonderful things, and that I feel like I have such a stronger idea of how RHA works and how to actually get projects off the ground,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Editor’s Note]: Laila Voss is a copy editor for the</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Daily Nexus</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

When Al-Anbar was a student at UCSB, they spoke against <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-senate-approves-funding-for-ben-shapiro-event-after-six-hour-meeting/\">conservative speaker Ben Shapiro visiting campus </a>and organized <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/muslim-students-push-back-against-immigration-ban/\">a protest against the travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Al-Anbar also spoke about the value of setting aside time to take care of oneself.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you need a second to come to terms with [being] a QTPOC person in the job sector post-grad, take that. It’ll be okay,” they said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one of the student-led workshops, first-year film and media studies major Alexia Duran led a discussion about growing up queer while speaking a different language. Duran shared their story as a queer international student from Mexico, and how transitioning from Spanish, a heavily gendered language, to English impacted their own process of navigating their identity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“English, for me, has been an escape,” Duran said, as they described overcoming the barriers that exist in gendered languages such as Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, QTPOC conference organizers and participants were satisfied with the turnout and success of the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m feeling very hopeful and want the conversation [about queer and trans students] to continue growing,” attendee Alvin Rios, a third-year student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want the QTPOC conference to eventually grow and have a lot more visibility and presence. This is a great space for workshops, but obviously there’s a lot more narratives being left out that could be included in this.”</span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the event can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/in-photos-queer-trans-people-of-color-conference-2019/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [May 22, 1:29 p.m.]: A previous version of this article said Al-Anbar founded Students for Justice in Palestine.

students each year. <em>Courtesy of Pamela Velazquez</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ucsbclop.com\">College Link Outreach Program</a> (C.L.O.P.) is a three-day, two-night program in which 150 underrepresented students across California are invited to the UCSB campus to explore opportunities for higher education.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. was originally created through the collaborative efforts of Hermanos Unidos, a Chicanx organization for University of California students, and Sigma Alpha Zeta, a multicultural group for women of color. The two organizations joined forces in 1999 to bring an inaugural group of 40 low-income students to the campus, according to the C.L.O.P. website.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. is an all-expense paid program that is fully funded by multiple Associated Students (A.S.) entities, including A.S Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC), Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.), Finance and Business (F&amp;B) and the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.).</p>\n<p>The program is also funded by individual donors and fundraisers, which take place throughout the entire school year.</p>\n<p>Over the past 20 years, the program has since expanded to serve 150 students each year. Students gain insight into the college experience by participating in workshops and attending mock lectures and overall gain exposure to campus resources.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. Coordinator Pamela Velazquez, a third-year sociology and Chicanx studies double major, has been involved with C.L.O.P. for the past three years.</p>\n<p>“I think our students often lack representation, so being able to see someone like you on a college campus can make a huge difference,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>“Institutions of higher education need to do a better job at reaching our students, but since it is not being done, it is up to us and programs like ours to really reach those students and impact them.”</p>\n<p>To get involved with C.L.O.P., high school students have to partake in an application process. C.L.O.P. outreach facilitators visit 20 participating high schools throughout Winter Quarter to encourage students to apply. Students then submit their field of interest, extracurriculars, community service hours and a two to three page personal statement explaining their motivations for attending college. Applications are due the March prior to the event.</p>\n<p>Several C.L.O.P. alumni have gone on to help lead the program themselves, including Entertainment Facilitator Kassandra Perez, a third-year financial math and statistics major.</p>\n<p>“My outlook has tremendously shifted now that I am part of the team because I see on a greater level how much this program is able to influence students,” Perez said in an email.</p>\n<p>“As a C.L.O.P.Per (our nickname for participants) I saw how the program impacted and helped me, but now that I am part of the team it is so rewarding to see all the students that have benefited from the program.”</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. participants are hosted by UCSB students in the Manzanita Village and San Rafael residence halls, a process that is facilitated by C.L.O.P. housing coordinators in collaboration with RHA. Participants eat in the various dining commons on campus throughout the course of the program, according to Velazquez.</p>\n<p>Participating students attend several workshops, including admissions, financial aid and A-G requirements workshops. These workshops are hosted by UCSB Admissions and Financial Aid staff, Perez said.</p>\n<p>“It is important to provide these students with this information because many of them will be first generation college students, and their parents/families may not be able to provide them with the insight they need to pursue a higher education,” Perez said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“C.L.O.P. is a way to remember that although we have made it this far and we continue to grow our experiences, a lot of students who were once like us are not.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Not having this information and not knowing what to do often discourages these students from applying to college.”</p>\n<p>Participants also attend several lifestyle workshops, including the “Gender Fishbowl,” in which they are separated into groups to discuss the difficulties that face young men and women of color. They also participate in the “Get a Life” workshop, which aims to represent the inequalities that certain social and class backgrounds face. After each workshop, facilitators lead a discussion to debrief each activity, highlighting the underlying meanings for students to take away.</p>\n<p>Several other events include an interactive chemistry demonstration and a “Know Your Rights” workshop, which teaches students how to proceed in situations that involve law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes we have students that may have difficulty when it comes to approaching police. They may have different feelings about the police in their own communities, so…we show them exactly how they should conduct themselves when approached,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. coordinators also put on a Resource Fair to highlight the opportunities that higher education has to offer. Several departments such as the Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E.) and Undocumented Student Services will be in attendance this year, in addition to the local fire and police departments, according to Velazquez.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. concludes with a barbeque on the beach and a closing ceremony, during which all teams and C.L.O.P. contributors are recognized in a closing video. For its 20th anniversary this year, C.L.O.P. will feature alumni and their experiences in the program via video submission.</p>\n<p>The program is also offering a new scholarship designed to help past C.L.O.P.Pers as they continue their journeys through higher education, another component of the program’s 20th anniversary celebration. The scholarship will involve an application process and be offered to one member of each grade.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. has placed an emphasis on expanding its social media presence in the past years as well, which has significantly contributed to the growth of the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m really proud of our social media so far. We have really started working with it to reach students, we know its the best way to reach them at their age,” Velasquez said.</p>\n<p>WIth social media campaigns like #CLOPWorks on the C.L.O.P. Instagram page, students are able to send in stories of how C.L.O.P. helped them and what their future plans were after attending the program, according to Velasquez.</p>\n<p>“Our students will ask questions about financial aid and classes, and that’s also the way we are able to connect to them through surveys or anything like that,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>Perez has a dynamic perspective on the impact of C.L.O.P. on the lives of students, having experienced being both a team leader and “C.L.O.P.Per” herself.</p>\n<p>“As a high schooler coming from a low-income family, I always knew I wanted to go to college, but always felt discouraged because I never thought that someone like me would be able to afford college or even be able to make it to college,” Perez said in the email.</p>\n<p>“C.L.O.P. benefited my life because prior to coming to the program, I didn’t even know what UCSB was, nor did I ever think I would ever apply here. Now I can proudly say that C.L.O.P. definitely influenced me to attend UCSB and give back to my community and students like myself.”</p>\n<p>Like Perez, Velasquez is passionate about C.L.O.P.’s impact on the lives of participants, as well as the necessity for such outreach programs on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“C.L.O.P. serves as an opportunity to inspire others and to grow as a college student as well. Sometimes college kind of takes a toll on us and we stop seeing what really matters and really caring about our communities,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>“C.L.O.P. is a way to remember that although we have made it this far and we continue to grow our experiences, a lot of students who were once like us are not.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-86522\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several administrations spoke at the town hall, including VP for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn (right). <em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), an extension of the Associated Students (A.S.) Human Rights Board, <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/asks-amended.pdf\">revised its list of Asks</a> on Feb. 4 to include mandatory training for Office of Student Life organizations and sports teams, a revised Title IX Office website and online access to Gaucho FYI content, among other requests.</p>\n<p>Monday’s town hall was the second of the year, following the first <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-26/sasa-hosts-town-hall-focuses-on-interpersonal-violence-prevention/\">town hall</a> that was held at the Pardall Center in November.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez led the meeting alongside SASA Vice Director Alya Ruiz and SASA Policy Analysts Vince Feliciano and Alia Reynolds.</p>\n<p>Title IX Officer Ariana Alvarez began by providing an update on the Department of Education’s <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf\">Proposed Title IX Amendments</a>. The department is still in the process of reviewing comments, which means that the status of the amendments is still unclear, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>The most concerning potential regulations include changes to the evidence threshold, scope of jurisdiction and responsible employee designation, according to Alvarez. Additional amendments include the right to cross-examination of survivors and perpetrators and a narrowing of the definition of sexual assault under Title IX.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.) Director Briana Conway said to students that despite the potential stress the proposed changes could bring survivors, C.A.R.E. will work to support them through the legal process however it can.</p>\n<p>Reynolds pointed to <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB493\">Senate Bill 493</a>, a piece of legislation recently introduced by Senator Hannah Beth Hannah-Beth Jackson, which aims to combat potential issues arising from the amendments.</p>\n<p>Reynolds questioned whether the UCSB administration would be taking a stance on the legislation. The UC system <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-03/uc-responds-to-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\">released a response</a> to the proposed amendments in December 2018, stating that the changes would “reverse decades of well-established, hard-won progress toward equity.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez responded that they are aware of the bill and are currently trying to navigate its position.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life Miles Ashlock discussed the possibility of requiring Standard of Excellence Training for OSL organizations and sports teams, which is another Ask proposed by SASA.</p>\n<p>The Standards of Excellence is an educational program run by C.A.R.E. that is currently required for fraternities and sororities on campus. SASA has requested that the training be required for all OSL organizations and sports teams.</p>\n<p>The current obstacles for Standards of Excellence training concerns the content of the curriculum, which is still under discussion, Ashlock said. OSL plans to meet with C.A.R.E. to review the Standards of Excellence.</p>\n<p>Alvarez gave an update on SASA’s third Ask, which requests a redesigned Public Accountability Report modeled after UCLA’s Title IX Office. UCLA’s model features an “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB currently produces an annual report, SASA feels that shifting to UCLA’s model will provide more thorough information.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Title IX Office is in the process of considering which aspects of UCLA’s model may be beneficial for UCSB, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Students and Director of Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity Kimberly Equinoa discussed the online accessibility of Gaucho FYI content, another Ask proposed by SASA.</p>\n<p>Equinoa predicts that the Gaucho FYI content will be accessible online within the next couple of months.</p>\n<p>SASA officers also discussed the Ask that requests $5,000 annually from UCSB. The funds would be used “to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>Ruiz clarified that funds for this request would ideally come from university fees, not student fees.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn suggested a formal proposal and budget for the ask, detailing what the campaign will accomplish. The SASA officers agreed to follow up on this request.</p>\n<p>SASA officers moved on to discuss the National College Health Assessment, a survey distributed to over 100 universities nationwide that assesses students’ “habits, behaviors, and perceptions,” according to National College Health Assessment website.</p>\n<p>The survey questions students on topics ranging from alcohol and drug use to personal safety and violence. It was distributed to UCSB students via email on Feb. 12.</p>\n<p>Ashlock explained that the survey provides reliable national data, allowing administration to see which issues are unique or less prevalent at UCSB. These trends allow administrators to gauge which programs and policies are beneficial.</p>\n<p>Feliciano voiced several of SASA’s concerns regarding the survey, including its lack of trigger warnings and feedback opportunities. He noted that SASA officers were also disturbed that the survey did not list any resources and neglected to give a clear definition of affirmative consent.</p>\n<p>Conway responded that UCSB did not have any jurisdiction over the content of the survey itself, only the email that was sent to students. The email provided a trigger warning, stating that there may be some “personal discomfort with the content of certain questions.”</p>\n<p>Conway also explained that the Health Equity Initiative, a work group that promotes health equity for underserved students, went through the survey last spring and wrote recommendations to the national organization. The group consists of members from RCSGD, C.A.R.E., C.A.P.S., Student Health, the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, Health &amp; Wellness and the Women’s Center.</p>\n<p>UCSB administration requested that the SASA Officers compose their feedback in writing to allow them to seriously acknowledge their concerns.</p>\n<p>SASA’s next town hall will take place in Spring Quarter, with exact date and location yet to be determined.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Acacia is located across the street from Embarcadero Hall.</em> Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Their I.V. office – located across the street from Embarcadero Hall, behind Cajé Cafe on Embarcadero del Norte – is the closest long-term counseling offered for UC Santa Barbara students, providing individual therapy, group therapy and psychiatry services.</p>\n<p>Acacia was founded in 2014 by Dr. Keith Higginbotham and Dr. Brett Donnelly. The two psychologists noticed a growing demand for mental health services while working at UCSB’s Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</p>\n<p>As a result, many students were referred to community providers to ensure consistent scheduling and shorter wait times. However, students faced several barriers to accessing these outside services, such as transportation issues, cost difficulties and provider availability.</p>\n<p>Recognizing these barriers, Higginbotham and Donnelly embraced an opportunity to create an accessible, welcoming therapy center to meet the growing needs of the student population.</p>\n<p>“We made it our mission to help students get the longer term care that they need and really address the barriers,” Higginbotham said in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Acacia has been providing services to the I.V. community for upwards of five years. Today, the office works in conjunction with C.A.P.S. to ensure an effective treatment plan for each patient.</p>\n<p>Students seeking treatment first attend C.A.P.S. on campus, where they may be referred for long-term care at Acacia.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. is a really important function in doing crisis work, that short-term treatment, and a lot of the outreach and education. We want to be their premier referral service by providing the best treatment and hiring therapists who are really well-skilled in working with student issues,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>Robbyn Jackson, clinical psychologist and lead director of Acacia’s I.V. office, said he is passionate about successfully serving the needs of the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“I see my role as finding the best clinicians I can to meet the needs of the student population. I’m always looking for really good quality therapists who are passionate about the work we do, and make sure that we are helping as many students as possible every week,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>The office is also home to Charlie the therapy dog, a trained therapy animal that brightens the I.V. community on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>With more than 16 therapists on staff, Higginbotham said that Acacia has a diverse pool of providers so as to make people with all identities feel welcome in their office. If a therapist at another clinic has an identity that someone is looking for, Acacia hopes to connect them through video sessions.</p>\n<p>Acacia also partners with several other organizations on campus, including C.A.R.E., the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) and the Disabled Students Program (DSP) to ensure quality mental health care to students of all identities.</p>\n<p>“We really appreciate the relationship with the university, to sort of work hand in hand with them, with referrals, understanding what the needs are that they’re seeing. We love to be able to reach out and partner with them as much as we can,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>The Acacia <a href=\"https://www.acaciaroots.org/\">Resources, Outreach, and Outpatient Therapy for Students (R.O.O.T.S)</a> non-profit project is also dedicated to aiding low-income students in accessing mental health services. Students and members of the community consistently raise funds for the project, which go toward mental health education and outreach as well.</p>\n<p>The office also runs the Mental Health Advocates Internship program, in which students that are interested in the psychology field can gain hands-on experience.</p>\n<p>“We do mock therapy sessions together so they can get a feel for what it’s like to be in the field, and they do events and all kinds of stuff for us. It’s a really great opportunity,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>According to Higginbotham, therapy has the potential to significantly change individuals’ lives for the better, especially young people.</p>\n<p>“You see a lot of growth, you see a lot of confidence building, and some people are just very different people today than when they came in,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>UCSB students are encouraged to access Acacia’s services through a referral from C.A.P.S. Students and members of the community can also access Acacia’s services through their <a href=\"https://www.acaciacw.com/isla-vista-appointment\">online registration form.</a></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The cookie program is also the country’s largest financial investment in girls annually.</p>\n<p>The Girl Scouts recently debuted “Caramel Chocolate Chip” for the 2019 season, accompanying the iconic line-up of Thin Mints, Samoas, Trefoils and more.</p>\n<p>This year, Girl Scouts sell cookies across campus in prime locations near the University Center, Pardall Tunnel and Davidson Library.</p>\n<p>Skyler, a local 13-year-old, set her stand in front of the library last Monday night. She said she has been selling cookies on the UCSB campus for the past two years.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of really enthusiastic people and it’s always a treat to be here,” Skyler said.</p>\n<p>Skyler experimented selling cookies at a variety of locations on campus and decided on the location based on where she found the most people.</p>\n<p>“As it gets later and people start to go to bed, I migrate over there,” Skyler said as she pointed toward the freshmen Chi-5 dorms.</p>\n<p>Thin Mints, Caramel Delights and Peanut Butter Patties are especially popular this year, according to Skyler. This year, Skyler’s goal is to sell 3,000 boxes of cookies.</p>\n<p>Lilly Rodriguez, the sister of two local Girl Scouts, posted on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page offering pre-orders for cookies. Within a day, she received over 50 messages.</p>\n<p>“I enjoy helping my sisters out so they can go on trips with their troop. My older sister is planning on going to San Francisco and my little sister will use the money for activities,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Many Girl Scouts are now accepting payment through Venmo, a mobile payment app, in an effort to increase sales to college students who may not carry cash.</p>\n<p>Sixth grader Olivia F. is excited by the increased profits from the usage of Venmo.</p>\n<p>“We love Venmo. We took over $1,000 on it at our UCSB cookie booth. Not all troops use it but we think it is a must,” Olivia said.</p>\n<p>“[Students] get very excited when they hear us yell ‘We take Venmo.’”</p>\n<p>Olivia is aiming to sell 500 boxes this year, enticed by the pair of narwhal slippers that she would win as a prize.

UCSB’s chapter is led by Conway, who has been working with the program since 2014.</p>\n<p>The meetings took place at UC Davis and spanned from Dec. 10 to Dec. 12. Those in attendance also included UC Interim Systemwide Title IX Coordinator Suzanne Taylor and Vice President for Student Affairs Robin Holmes Sullivan.</p>\n<p>The directors typically hold biannual meetings to discuss a multitude of issues related to sexual assault and violence, Conway said. At last week’s meeting, their primary concern was the Department of Education’s recent proposed Title IX changes.</p>\n<p>Among various modifications, the changes propose narrowing the definition of sexual assault under Title IX and allowing for the cross-examination of accusers and respondents in live courtroom hearings.</p>\n<p>The C.A.R.E. directors discussed how these changes would disrupt the UC’s current “single-investigator model” by allowing for the cross-examination of accusers and respondents in live hearings.</p>\n<p>Currently, the UC’s model uses a “neutral-fact finding” investigator to determine whether there is enough evidence to constitute a violation of Title IX policy. The amendments would change this by shifting disputes to traditional courtroom settings, opening the possibility of power imbalances, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>“It’s becoming much more of a legalized process that can feel really intimidating to someone in trauma. Obviously some parties choose to have lawyers involved, so there’s an imbalance in power there if one party has a lawyer and the other doesn’t,” she said.</p>\n<p>Other concerns related to this amendment includes the financial ability of students to pay for legal services often needed to pursue a case in court, Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway feels that shifting to the courtroom model would create unnecessarily difficult hurdles for survivors as well as alleged perpetrators.</p>\n<p>“Having to put a survivor in the same room as their perpetrator is barbaric, but that’s not to say that the student who is defending their academic future isn’t also in a stressful situation,” Conway said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I think the burden would fall on either the UC or our campus to integrate how what happens in Isla Vista is tied to the educational experience of the students.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the C.A.R.E. directors considered how schools would no longer be required to investigate off-campus allegations, which could leave a large number of incidents in neighboring communities ignored, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>She feels that especially with UCSB and Isla Vista, survivors’ experiences would be severely neglected.</p>\n<p>Conway hopes that whatever transpires with the proposed changes, UC administrators will be able to maintain protections of their students under the law. However, she said it might be up to the UC system to decide how to proceed with pursuing off-campus cases in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think the burden would fall on either the UC or our campus to integrate how what happens in Isla Vista is tied to the educational experience of the students.”</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. directors also discussed controversies over the amount of evidence required for Title IX convictions.</p>\n<p>Currently, the “preponderance of evidence” standard requires that institutions follow the lowest standard of evidence when deciding if students have violated Title IX. This standard was set forth by the Obama administration, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/devos-colleges-sex-assault.html\">New York Times.</a></p>\n<p>With the changes, the Department of Education would instead let schools decide which standard to follow, whether it be “preponderance of the evidence” or a higher standard of “clear and convincing evidence,” as the <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf\">department’s report</a> stated.</p>\n<p>According to the report, some cases carry “particularly grave consequences for a respondent’s reputation and ability to pursue a professional career,” which might warrant a higher standard of proof.</p>\n<p>Whether it be “preponderance of evidence” or “clear and convincing evidence,” institutions would be required to use the same standard for students and faculty members, the report said.</p>\n<p>Conway agrees that regardless of the accepted standard, it is most important for institutions use the same guidelines for employees and students alike.</p>\n<p>“When we treat populations with different standards of evidence … it almost creates a system of power and privilege,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>In light of the proposed amendments, C.A.R.E. directors also talked about how schools can provide resources.</p>\n<p>“If the federal government is going to start narrowing down the help that we can provide survivors in the administrative process, we as an institution need to respond to broader, better arms to help care for the human being,” she said.</p>\n<p>This includes ensuring that “responsible employees” respond adequately to reports of sexual assault and are trained to provide resources for students and connect them to programs like C.A.R.E. It also includes communicating students’ rights to survivors and helping them through processes like law enforcement and civil reporting.</p>\n<p>Taylor and UC President Janet Napolitano, who recently wrote a <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-troubled-proposed-changes-sexual-harassment-rules\">press release</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/janet-napolitano-dont-let-the-trump-administration-undermine-title-ix/2018/12/04/6c91f316-f7fc-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.14e3cbe04ab6\">op-ed</a> about this issue respectively, will factor C.A.R.E.’s discussion into the official UC opinion on the Title IX changes, Conway said.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education has allowed for a 60-day period of public comment following the proposed changes. It will be required to respond to any “substantive” comments after the conclusion of the period on Jan. 21, 2019.</p>\n<p>Conway encourages students, faculty and community members to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“We want them to hear their constituencies’ voice of why these are problematic or detrimental. The more voices we use, the harder it is to justify the decision,” she said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

assault.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education has authorized a 60 day period of public comment regarding the proposal.</p>\n<p>U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who spearheaded the guidelines change, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-proposed-title-ix-rule-provides-clarity-schools-support-survivors-and-due-process-rights-all\">said the amendments were made</a> with both the survivor and accused student in mind.</p>\n<p>“My focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment,” DeVos said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on.”</p>\n<p>The Title IX amendments would rework the definition of sexual assault, changing it from “incidents that limit a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the educational programs” to “conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school’s education program or activity,” according to the proposal.</p>\n<p>This redefinition would limit what is legally considered sexual harassment, thus invalidating the experiences of many victims, Taylor said.</p>\n<p>“Narrowing the scope of what constitutes sexual harassment risks leaving serious misconduct unaddressed,” she said in the press release.</p>\n<p>The Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which enforces civil rights laws in programs that receive federal assistance, has used an appropriate definition of sexual harassment in the past, according to Taylor.</p>\n<p>Changes to this definition would not only create “new and unnecessary hurdles” for survivors but also create obstacles for OCR’s enforcement of Title IX.</p>\n<p>“The proposed rules significantly weaken the OCR’s authority to enforce Title IX. In stark contrast to its current enforcement powers, OCR would not require changes to a school’s process unless it determines the school is ‘deliberately indifferent,’ an incredibly high standard,” Taylor said in her statement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the proposed regulations would require live hearings for sexual assault allegations. These live hearings would allow for the cross-examination of plaintiffs through the parties’ advisors, according to the amendments report.</p>\n<p>Taylor expressed doubt that alterations to Title IX policy would improve the legal proceedings following incidents of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The rules are prescriptive… the proposed hearings would allow representatives of alleged assailants to directly cross-examine complainants, which is wholly unnecessary and inherently intimidating, especially to students making the already difficult decision to come forward,” Taylor said.</p>\n<p>Taylor is adamant about the UC’s stance against the proposed regulations, calling the amendments “ill-advised attempts to erode important Title IX protections for all members of the community.”</p>\n<p>“UC remains steadfast in its commitment to combating sexual violence through prevention, transparent and fair resolution processes, and just outcomes,” she said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“The university will continue to ensure its policies and procedures protect the rights and well-being of all parties in the process.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The event was organized by Senator Solomon (left). <em>Courtesy of Zion Solomon</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB students, led by UCSB Associated Students Senator Zion Solomon, organized the “Trans Joy Take Over” to increase visibility within the trans community.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to bring a positive movement and show trans people that they are seen and visible and show people why it’s important to show solidarity with trans folks even if they aren’t trans themselves,” said Solomon, a second-year history of public policy major.</p>\n<p>The effort consisted of card- and poster-making activities on Monday and Tuesday in the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) room, located within the Student Resource Building (SRB).</p>\n<p>Students also tabled in the Arbor on Thursday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>\n<p>These events were supported with funds from the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and RCSGD, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>“I know that suicide rates for trans people are rising and it’s not good for the mental health of trans people to be seeing this in the media, so regardless of whether they’re home or here, people are affected by it,” they said.</p>\n<p>Several other volunteers joined Solomon in the Arbor.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Andres, a second-year sociology major, expressed that this event could be very informative and valuable to people without much knowledge of the transgender community.</p>\n<p>“I think having visibility, having trans flags and rainbow flags out here and all of our signs really can leave an impact on someone who might not know a lot about the trans or LGBTQ+ community,” Andres said.</p>\n<p>Diego Reyes, a second-year biology major who tabled on Thursday, is adamant about the drastic implications the Trump Administration’s policy might have.</p>\n<p>“I know there are a lot of people who have their own opinions on what being transgender means and about what being non-binary means,” Reyes said. “I feel like that passing gives them a pass to spread trans antagonism and trans hatred… And I think if that passes then it’s gonna come back probably a hundred times worse [than it already is].”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“It’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UCSB’s administration has “been pretty responsive to trans needs” but always has room to improve, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Their primary concern is how the environment created by students on campus for transgender people could potentially see a big change following the gender redefinition policy.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that this will affect this university’s response. Maybe the students’ response and maybe transphobic people at this university, but I think we should still be pushing the university to support trans students regardless of whatever the administration says,” Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Riley Hsieh, a second-year political science major, talked about the importance of support from allies who extend beyond just the queer and trans community.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important that we have allies in the community… because it’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n<p>Ivana Cruz spoke about how mistakes in pronoun use, whether deliberate or not, can feel invalidating and isolating, “especially in academic circles.”</p>\n<p>“Even if there’s a slip with a pronoun and they don’t take time to acknowledge that, it can really intimidate you from an already-intimidating process of reaching out to your professors.”</p>\n<p>However, Cruz stressed that solidarity can lead to progress and inclusivity and positive change.</p>\n<p>“I try to look at what’s possible. I look at the fact that 20 years ago we wouldn’t be having an event like this. We wouldn’t be having open conversations about pronouns without being laughed at. They, them would still be grammatically incorrect,” Cruz said.</p>\n<p>“I just think that we as a community have a responsibility to grow more and that’s essentially what’s going to lead to a very progressing change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The university is demanding less security and more inequality for tens of thousands of its workers, and that is completely at odds with its promise to ‘pioneer a better future’ for California.”</p>\n<p>Today’s protests at UCSB were part of a much bigger UC-wide demonstration that encompasses all 10 campuses.</p>\n<p>Protestors will strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. They will hold rallies from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. each day under Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>Nothing has improved for AFSCME workers since the last demonstration, according to Bill Fitzpatrick, campus representative of University Professional &amp; Technical Employees (UPTE).</p>\n<p>UPTE workers are striking this week in solidarity with AFSCME.</p>\n<p>“The university has now forced [the workers] to accept the terms of the university’s offers without the benefit of any more negotiations,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>Fitzpatrick, who represents 1,040 people in UPTE and voices their concerns to UC administration, has spent the past year and a half traveling to various UC campuses to bargain for workers’ conditions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“Students usually think of custodian staff or groundskeepers as ‘ghost people.’ They don’t want to see them, they just want to see the product of their work.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UCSB workers are among the lowest paid in the system, despite the high cost of living associated with the Santa Barbara area, Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>“Nobody is asking for an outrageous paycheck. We have a couple of titles here where the potential pay is 52 percent lower than the UC Davis campus for the same job titles. We are demanding an explanation of why that would be fair to us, why we are among the lowest paid campuses.”</p>\n<p>For Esther Ramirez, a senior custodian in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall for the past 15 years, the future of UC workers’ conditions remains unclear.</p>\n<p>“It’s the second strike; I don’t know what is next,” Ramirez said. “It’s hard because I’m a single mom, and my family of three needs to take other jobs to support the family.”</p>\n<p>According to a UC worker who asked to remain anonymous, UC employees are often considered invisible.</p>\n<p>“Students usually think of custodian staff or groundskeepers as ‘ghost people.’ They don’t want to see them, they just want to see the product of their work.”</p>\n<p>Dozens of UC Santa Barbara students, as well as several professors, were among the workers on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Shelsea Sanchez, a second-year political science major and student worker in the dining commons, said she felt the need to support her coworkers in the demonstration.</p>\n<p>“I see and interact with these workers on a daily basis and see how the UC is super exploitative when it comes to working conditions,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I have to use my voice as a student to come out and represent those people who can’t talk for themselves.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez is hopeful more students will gather for the protests on Wednesday and Thursday, adamant that students have a unique platform to advocate for reform.</p>\n<p>”Everybody here loves working at their jobs and would love to stay here. But if the UC can’t make it affordable to where we can’t afford to work at a UC and live in the Santa Barbara area, a lot of people aren’t able to stay with us,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>“We would love to come to terms with a fair contract and get back to work without this distraction.”</p>\n<p>Further <em>Nexus</em> coverage for the strike can be viewed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1054710350061301763\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

It also focuses these resources toward students from low-income communities, with the hope of giving them a higher chance of attending college and becoming productive members of the workforce.</p>\n<p>“We have some serious issues on the planet that must be solved soon, and students with a good education can be positioned to be part of that solution,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>Ortiz, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1985, originally got involved with the organization as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>He worked as a tutor for the program during his college years and went on to take a temporary job doing outreach following his graduation.</p>\n<p>After continuing his education at Cal State Northridge and the University of La Verne, he eventually returned to UCSB in 2000 to become EAOP Director.</p>\n<p>“We need more students to participate in higher ed. Our economy needs a highly educated workforce and we are helping that process,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>When the EAOP was first created, its intent was to diversify the student body of UC campuses by providing resources to racial minorities.</p>\n<p>Over the years, its focus has shifted to targeting low-income, first-generation students who do not have readily available access to college services. The program now spans three counties and soon will be serving 11 high schools.</p>\n<p>“The idea was to increase college enrollment rates from these schools that were usually associated with low-income communities that don’t always have the same resources to prepare for college,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>With over 2,000 students enrolled in its cohort, the program’s services reach a wide range of students, including those at the middle and elementary school levels.</p>\n<p>EAOP’s welcoming atmosphere is evident through its dedicated staff. Mirka Lopez, a first-generation student herself, works as college-site coordinator for the program.</p>\n<p>“[The EAOP] gives them that motivation and encouragement because sometimes they don’t think they belong at a UC, or they’ve never set foot on a college campus,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>“Through this program they get the opportunity to explore their options and learn what kind of resources there are.”</p>\n<p>The program also has several student interns on staff, allowing UCSB students to serve as role models for under-represented teenagers.</p>\n<p>For Daniel Segura, a second-year sociology major and EAOP intern, the program is especially meaningful.</p>\n<p>“It means a lot to me because I was a part of EAOP myself in high school, so my first experiences with college were through the program,” Segura said.</p>\n<p>“Now that we’re interns, we get to see those effects on other kids, seeing them believe that college is actually possible because someone like them actually made it.”</p>\n<p>However, EAOP has endured its share of struggles over the years, including several budget and staff cuts.</p>\n<p>Staff went from 23 to nine in the mid-2000s, and EAOP suffered additional monetary cuts due to the fluctuating economy, according to Ortiz.</p>\n<p>EAOP began a using new budget model in 2007 that shares costs with its school sites to help run the program. They now use a “Dual Service Model,” aiming resources toward all students, regardless of their indicated college interest level.</p>\n<p>“So in essence, we cover the entire school. We don’t just raise the cohort’s college-going rate, we aim at raising the graduating class’s college-going rates,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>UCSB EAOP also recently trained UCLA and UCR EAOPs to replicate its model, hoping to impact not only the surrounding community but also the state as a whole.</p>\n<p>The program’s influence was made clear on Friday during a college-readiness event, which gave dozens of low-income and first-generation high school students a first look at UCSB’s campus.</p>\n<p>During this event, UCSB undergraduate volunteers gave tours and provided advice to the aforementioned students.</p>\n<p>“[EAOP] is changing the world one school at a time,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Lopez’s first name is Mirka, not Lirka. </em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: UCSB EAOP is training other UC’s to “replicate” its model, not “respect” its model. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
