over the next days and weeks, Ansorg said.</span> <em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newest confirmed coronavirus cases are residents between 22 to 59 years of age, with four cases in South County and two cases in North County, according to Batson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the total confirmed cases, 19 are recovering from home, four have fully recovered –– and have completed 14 days of monitoring by the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department –– and only one person has been hospitalized due to the virus, Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batson said she and her team are preparing to present specific information about the locations and regions where cases have been identified in coming days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county plans to hold press conferences every day this week to update the public on the coronavirus spread and efforts to contain it, Gina DePinto, communications manager for Santa Barbara County, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the number of cases grows in the county, the department’s efforts will focus on mitigation, Batson said, adding that the department will “focus [its] investigation efforts on confirmed individuals who have had exposures in congregate settings such as health care facilities, correctional facilities, shelters, skilled nursing facilities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cases will increase and resources will be much more impacted,” Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Public Health Officer Henning Ansorg urged Santa Barbarans to stay at home as much as possible and to “assume the virus is in your community, assume you are at risk for contracting it and take actions to stop the spread.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant rise in cases is expected over the next days and weeks, Ansorg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t really anticipate the exact numbers or over what period of time they will occur, but we are really feeling comfortable that we can meet the demand,” Ansorg said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Sheriff-Coroner Bill Brown said at the press conference that “the vast majority of people” in the county are adhering to the statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect on Thursday evening, but that repeat violators of the order could be cited, arrested and jailed, “particularly if a violator has been made aware of the order and continues to violate it.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If a person or group of people willingly continues to break the public health order, they could be charged with a misdemeanor crime and they could be cited, and in certain repeated or egregious cases, they could be arrested and jailed for noncompliance,” Brown said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first tactic for officers in enforcing the stay-at-home order will be an “explanation” of the order and a “warning,” as Brown noted that some of those who have not complied with the stay-at-home order were previously unaware or confused about the restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown added that the number of law enforcement calls, medical service calls and arrests reduced significantly over the weekend, but said there has been an uptick in domestic disturbances since the stay-at-home order was placed.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

But now, at the end of her second year, she does not believe that the program was made for people like her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man,” Eseka said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her experience with the Honors Program underscores an issue that has loomed over the department’s staff for years — the program’s demographic fails to reflect the diversity of students that exists in UCSB’s student body as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2018-2019 school year, UCSB boasted one of the most diverse student bodies of any college in the nation, snagging 14th place in “Best Ethnic Diversity” among public national universities by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US News &amp; World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2018/019172/top-five\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advertised by the university at the time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But the Honors Program told a different story. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost half of the 1,713 students in the honors program in 2018-19 school year identified as white or Caucasian, despite white or Caucasian students making up only about 30% of the total student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicanx/Latinx and Black/African American populations in the Honors Program represented less than half of their respective proportions in the student body, according to numbers from UCSB’s Office of Budget &amp; Planning in the 2018-19 school year. Chicanx/Latinx students made up about 12% of the Honors Program compared to 29% of the student body; Black/African American students made up about two percent of the Honors Program compared to five percent of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-KN8eC\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of UCSB Undergraduates Campuswide vs. in the Honors Program, 2018-19\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KN8eC/3/\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Stacked Column Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of nearly 40 Black students in the program, Eseka doesn’t always see diversity at program activities, such as honor seminars, and she said the university could be doing more to support people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The chance of me being the only Black person in that class is really high and sometimes maybe as an honors [student], you might get second looks, like ‘Are you in the right place?’ and you have to be like ‘Yeah, I am,’” Eseka said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Eseka, feeling comfortable in the Honors Program is key to recruiting and retaining people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Diversity is really necessary to encourage more people to come to the program and then to stay in the program, so you don’t feel lonely or feel left out or singled out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And of the new honors students enrolling for the 2019-2020 school year, diversity statistics aren’t improving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the incoming group of freshmen – the class of 2023 – invited to join the Honors Program, almost half of the students are white. Chicanx, Latinx and African American students collectively make up less than 10% of the honors-eligible students. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-eoOjm\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of Incoming UCSB Freshman Admitted to the Honors Program, Fall 2019\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eoOjm/6/\" height=\"458\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, associate vice chancellor for undergraduate education, is one person in the honors departments who has kept the issue of diversity on his radar. When he first started to look more closely at the honors department about three years ago, Stopple noted several concerns with the way the program had been functioning, particularly with how the program included and supported diverse student populations at UCSB.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a high rate of attrition, of students not staying in the program. There was also a concern that the program didn’t represent the diversity of UCSB [because] it was not particularly diverse,” Stopple said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But three years since Stopple’s arrival, the diversity of students in the program still lags behind the diversity of the campus as a whole. Stopple said his office has worked in several ways to modify the program to support students of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those efforts is the collaborative Q&amp;A panel discussion put on in May 2019 by Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the honors department. Over a hundred first-year students who were on track to meet the honors requirements were invited to attend the information panel to hear from current EOP honors students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said the panel, which he started in 2017, has been effective in recruiting more diverse students to the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eseka spoke alongside Stella Delgado, a UCSB third-year history of public policy and anthropology double major, as panelists during the event. The two discussed EOP students’ concerns about the “intimidation” factor of the Honors Program. Some students felt the “elitist” reputation of the Honors Program was something that gave them reservations about applying, Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Delgado, the program’s lack of diversity points to “the different challenges students of color face on campus and the different challenges students from lower-income communities also face.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a student of color and a low-income student, I’ve had to maintain having a job for most of my time at UCSB, which has taken away from academics,” Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can enter the program in two ways: by being invited into the Honors Program when admitted to the university or by applying to the program the summer after their freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising sophomores are required to adhere to a 3.5 GPA and 36 letter-graded units requirement to enter the program, Stopple said.  Students can apply for the program in July and are admitted so long as they meet the GPA and unit requirements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said GPA is a “crude” metric and that he “would prefer to do something different.” But for now, due to “limited resources,” the honors department cannot incorporate more criteria for their application process besides the “purely quantitative” measures currently in place, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple did, however, lower the GPA requirement for the honors program from 3.6 to 3.5 in June 2017 in order to include more students in the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several advantages that come with being in the Honors Program; one, Stopple said, is having priority enrollment, which allows honors students to be among the first to enroll in classes during pass times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other advantages that come with being in the Honors Program include access to special academic advising, extended library privileges and academic and community service opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The promise of one-on-one time with professors, building relationships for letters of recommendations and beefing up resumes with honors status draws many students to the program. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michelle McKee, a recent graduate of the Honors Program, said “it’s very hard to get one-on-one time with the professors and to really talk with and work with the professors” without having the advantages of the Honors Program.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She joined the Honors Program after her freshman year and said the perks benefitted her education at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The day-one pass time is a plus,” she said. “But I also just knew that there were a lot of great opportunities if you were involved in the Honors Program including these really cool honors seminars and I’ve just been able to take so many interesting classes that I wouldn’t have taken otherwise.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB honors student, Michael Stallworth, said his experience in the Honors Program helped him get settled into the university and allowed him to “work with other people who are like-minded and just want to… achieve as much as they can.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth noted that a diverse honors program would indicate a university that adequately supports students of color and students from unique backgrounds, something still in the works at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It just shows that we have people from different communities who are able to be successful at UCSB and still be able to take advantage of the opportunities that are offered,” Stallworth said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the experience of each student in the Honors Program varies, many agree that increasing and supporting diverse populations in the program remains an important goal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know how much more opportunities and advantages I get being in the Honors Program between volunteer opportunities, earlier pass times, separate advisors,” said Zeina Safadi, an honors fourth-year political science major. “And so it would be disheartening to think that it was only to a specific group of students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Eseka said the root of the problem is in the way minority students perceive the Honors Program, and given the unique challenges they already face at UCSB, honors could be exactly what these students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You hear honors [and] you think ‘I’m not meant for this,’ not because you don’t have the credentials, but just because… historically, as a low-income first generation minority, you’ve…  had so many barriers that have prevented you from getting here faster or at the same pace as others.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Eseka, the Honors Program makes achieving her academic and career goals a little bit easier. The distinction of being in the Honors Program in college is an edge that she said she needs to accomplish her goals after college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s one reason why I keep on going because I know I’m gonna hit so many barriers. It’s just gonna make it one less hoop.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

year.<em> </em></span><em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plaintiff in the most recent case, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Lee Reyes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of California Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is UC Santa Barbara UC Police Department officer Jonathan Lee Reyes. In the suit, Reyes alleges he was retaliated against for reporting misconduct in the department relating to the retention and promotion of an unqualified police trainee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Reyes’ whistleblowing led UCPD Lieutenant David Millard and UCPD Sergeant Gregory Smorodinsky to block Reyes from receiving a promotion to higher positions and that the two gave Reyes an unfair poor performance review.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an individual within UCPD who asked that their name not be used, Millard is currently at a training course at the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy; the individual provided photographic evidence to the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Millard was there and not on the UC Santa Barbara campus as of May 9. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was unable to comment on whether or not Millard was at the FBI academy, but could confirm that he is still an active member of the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that UCPD “retaliated against other employees based on the same protected class [as Reyes].” The suit also alleges that UCPD failed to  “discipline other employees outside [Reyes’] own protected class as severely” for the same actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes’ lawsuit is the latest of four lawsuits filed against the department since late last year, all of which allege that the plaintiffs were retaliated against for blowing the whistle on misconduct in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other three suits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v.

UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the complaint alleges that Millard repeatedly promoted a trainee officer from lower positions despite opposition from Reyes and others in the department who were concerned about the trainee’s performance. Reyes alleges he brought concerns forward to Millard multiple times, including when the trainee was first assigned to Reyes and later when Millard announced the trainee had completed Field Training Officer (FTO) training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case alleges that Millard’s approval to promote the unqualified trainee created “a threat to the safety of the public and the University” and violated <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=832\">California Penal Code 832</a>, which states that “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">peace officer shall satisfactorily complete an introductory training course.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in court documents begin in June 2017, when Reyes was assigned as an FTO with the trainee. Court documents say that after Millard announced in an email that the trainee will advance to the next phase, Reyes, along with several other officers, objected the promotion, pointing to “multiple evaluations by FTO’s [which] indicated that the trainee was failing,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite an FTO’s recommendation for the trainee’s termination and the trainee’s failure to pass a program from the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (P.O.S.T.) — the body responsible for creating law enforcement training requirements — Lieutenant Millard “successfully released [the trainee] from FTO training,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes then allegedly emailed the region coordinator for P.O.S.T. to relay his concerns about the failing trainee. Millard later met with Reyes and accused him of “not following an order” to promote the trainee, court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2017, Reyes was denied a promotion to corporal, despite being “better qualified for the position than other candidates selected for the position,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in September 2017, Reyes applied for a position as a sergeant but was again denied the promotion in March 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes alleges that he did not receive these positions, despite his qualifications, due to retaliation from Millard regarding the trainee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit also alleges that Reyes’ poor performance review from 2018 was another result of the department’s retaliation, this time from Smorodinsky “under the direction of [Millard].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents state “the review was very critical” and omitted “various positive things throughout the year.” Reyes submitted a grievance to the department “which detailed each point in his review that he felt was inaccurate or unwarranted,” and his review was later overturned in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in the suit involve a handful of other officers as well, including former Police Chief Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief Cathy Farley, Sergeant Gregory Pierce and Sergeant Rory Sheehey, who are named in the other cases as well. However, none of the aforementioned officers are being sued in Reyes’ case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three of the four cases filed since November 2018, including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are represented by the same law firm, Richie Litigation, based in Los Angeles.

She said the physical space within Associated Students (A.S.) Main in the Multi-Cultural Center was in poor condition and lacked the supplies needed to do casework effectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coming in and realizing all of these things … the person who assumes this position has to really care about students and want to do it,” Martinez said in an interview with the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of immediately beginning the projects she planned for her term, Martinez said she first “had to take a huge step back” and “really pick apart the foundations” in order to improve the general functioning of the office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I settled into the position in the summer, that’s when I realized that this office needed to be number one, the foundation needed to be fixed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One fundamental part of this was rewriting A.S. Legal Code for the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) in order to better reflect the needs of students. Martinez said she changed the former divisions of casework within the office from Academic, Housing, Code of Conduct and Public Interest to consolidate some categories and create new divisions, which are now Grievances, Conduct and Academic and Financial Aid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this new organization of divisions fostered a more streamlined approach to case handling, in addition to making the process more intuitive for students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rewriting Legal Code also included taking out the polling analyst project that was added the year before by Tannenbaum. Martinez said that the project’s execution did not reflect the initial vision or the needs of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In terms of the execution and the survey questions and everything, there wasn’t really anything there,” Martinez said. “Those questions that they had spent the whole year working on, I didn’t see how they would it would directly benefit this office.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her term, Martinez also began a project to create a database of past cases that were previously filed physically. Now, the office files all cases online, and the next S.A.G. will be able to use that database to observe patterns in the data of the cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez also helped to create a new logo for the OSA, which she said would help with outreach and better reflect the services of the office. She also noted that her office was more active on social media compared to her predecessor’s office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, Martinez did not have updated office hours for Spring Quarter 2019 available on the website, which she said was due to ongoing construction of the website. Office hours for Spring Quarter were also not readily available on the S.A.G.’s Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez collaborated with other UC campuses’ OSAs throughout the year to inform some of her projects for her term as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve done a lot of close communication to the other campuses and seeing how their student advocate offices work and what works well for them and what doesn’t.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, conversations with UC San Diego inspired Martinez to create an online appointment system for the office, similar to the one she had seen at their campus. The project is still in progress, but Martinez said she hopes it will make the office more accessible and user-friendly to students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez also helped lift a project off the ground that had been floating in the office for some time: moving OSA office to the Pardall Center in Isla Vista. The idea was something Robin Unander, the attorney for A.S., introduced to Martinez, and now something that Martinez hopes to pass on to the new S.A.G.-elect, Andrew Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The move aims to provide a more secure and confidential place for students to air their grievances, cases or concerns with OSA staff. Martinez’s case workers began holding office hours in the Pardall Center beginning in Spring Quarter 2019. The case workers from OSA literally worked alongside Undocumented Student Services and other legal services to create a more centralized space for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this quarter has focused on the logistics of moving the office, but she hopes that the OSA will be operating its services from the Pardall Center and the current space in A.S. Main will be used for administrative tasks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said a goal of hers for this year was to advocate for historically underrepresented and silenced students on campus. One way she addressed this was through her hiring decisions within the office. Martinez said she intentionally hired staff that came from different communities, clubs and cultural groups in order to better reach those people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In turn, Martinez said the staff in OSA created a more welcoming place for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people who I hired in the office are definitely a lot more understanding of the students who come in and they know how to talk to them better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said her own background, as well as her work in various roles on campus, including as an A.S. senator in the 2017-2018 school year, helped her better understand students alongside her caseworkers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just know what it feels like to need help and not know where to go,” Martinez said. “Because of our background and experiences, I feel like a lot of people are more willing to go to great lengths to make sure that student is helped, that a student gets what they need.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this aspect of her office is an improvement over Tannenbaum’s, citing that her office was more efficient in completing casework. Martinez said her office completed around 60 cases over the course of the year, but she noted that a lot of helping students involved giving guidance, talking things over and resolving problems that didn’t necessitate an officially documented case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez initiated significant projects during her term and followed through with a handful of the platform promises she made during her campaign. She had hoped to collaborate more with other groups on campus to specifically address student needs, but she said the conditions of the office that she inherited required more attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Martinez at times failed to be completely transparent with the student body. Martinez <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/four-a-s-executives-over-last-5-years-were-not-enrolled-in-school-in-possible-violation-of-legal-code/\">withdrew from classes during Fall Quarter 2018</a>, but never came forward about withdrawing until after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported the withdrawal in Winter Quarter 2019. Concerns about Martinez’s eligibility for the position erupted soon after, but ultimately, A.S. Legal Code proved inconclusive on whether or not an A.S. executive could serve while not enrolled in classes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said her decision to withdraw was a hard one to make and that she withdrew on the final day of the quarter –– something Martinez said proves she was still a student and able to serve her constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not like I took a break from the quarter. It’s not like I was completely absent,” Martinez said. “I was still very much involved in everything and doing everything I had to do.”</span></p>\n<p>She later explained in a message that she initially withdrew because she “had experienced ongoing incidents of interpersonal violence… I was involved in circumstances prompting the involvement of CARE and Title IX.”</p>\n<p>“Working through the trauma and healing from the violence made focusing on academics nearly impossible.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, at the end of her term, Martinez wants to pass on her remaining projects to her successor and some advice, as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Have people who work in your office who care about students and that are represented in different communities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez echoes some of her previous goals for her term in her advice to Nguyen, but also encourages Nguyen to embrace that some of the best work is the work that sets up others to be successful as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like our whole office has done a lot of work to make sure that this office is successful in the long run and so I would just encourage Nguyen to kind of do the same.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, Martinez said the next S.A.G. needs to be dedicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just make sure that you really care about the work that you’re doing.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [5/20, 9:53 a.m.]: This article was updated to include further statements from Martinez regarding her withdrawal from Fall Quarter 2018. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Signa filed his own lawsuit against former UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson in November 2018. <em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit makes several allegations against current and former members of UCPD, including former Chief of Police Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief of Police Cathy Farley, Lieutenant David Millard, Lieutenant Mark Signa, Lieutenant Robert Romero, Officer Tiffany Little, Officer Michael Little and Officer Ryan Hashimoto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges Smith was consistently retaliated against by UCPD staff for bringing attention to concerning practices and behaviors within the department. Some of Smith’s concerns included alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, of fellow officers and of sexual assault and rape victims, as well as falsifying sexual assault reports and racial discrimination. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit is the most recent of the three to be filed. It alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the plaintiff in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">case against UCPD filed in November 2018, consistently retaliated against Smith. Smith allegedly brought repeated grievances about Lieutenant Signa and other officers’ behavior to former Chief Olson, but court documents state Smith “has continued to be the target of harassment and retaliation” – even after resigning from the department in November 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, court documents allege that Smith participated in a “Good Ole Boys’ Club” within the department, which allegedly fostered and condoned misconduct, favoritism, harassment and retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final of the three suits filed against UCPD since November is from Officers Tiffany and Michael Little, spouses working within the department. According to court documents, in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Little v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the pair alleged that they were retaliated against after reporting Smith for allegedly having an extramarital affair with a subordinate officer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three cases referenced specific events in which the officers were both involved but alleged different circumstances and details on what exactly happened. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the most recent case filed, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. UCPD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Smith alleges that Officer Signa, Officers Tiffany and Michael Little and Officer Hashimoto “engaged in relentless acts of defamation of character and false light” and “have created and promoted a narrative within the UCPD and surrounding law enforcement agencies” about Smith’s resignation and integrity as an officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case also alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the Littles and other officers “conspired” against Smith by making a personnel complaint against him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith resigned near the end of 2017 due to alleged “ongoing harassment and retaliation” and UCSB’s “inaction” in response to the conduct, court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegations in Smith’s case against UCPD date back to 2014, shortly after Smith was hired in the department, according to court documents. Below are the specific allegations the case makes against individual UCPD officers and the department as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lieutenant Mark Signa </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents allege that since the start of Smith’s employment in August 2012, a group of officers have “consistently failed to leave the station for nearly entire shifts and spent most nights at the station playing video games, watching movies, and/or browsing the internet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa allegedly participated in these activities and showed “inappropriate ‘Youtube’ videos to the squad.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sergeant, Smith allegedly “gave clear directives that officers were to stay out of the station, not to watch TV or movies or play video games on duty,” court documents state. In response, Lieutenant Signa allegedly “scoffed” at Smith’s directives and posted “multiple colored photocopies of [World War II-era] General Patton throughout [the] station” with Smith’s name on them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly requested multiple trainings in the time span between 2015 and 2017, but “Signa denied all of these requests, while consistently allowing other sergeants to attend courses,” court documents allege. When Smith asked about this, Lieutenant Signa allegedly said Smith was “developed enough” and that the “Department did not need to spend any money” on Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around April 2015, amid “scrutiny regarding the handling of sexual assault cases,” the department allegedly took reports in which “males were being listed as rape and sexual assault suspects, despite no evidence of a crime occurring,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The department also allegedly took reports “where victim’s statements were being exaggerated to meet elements of a crime.” Signa allegedly ordered that officers continue “classifying all males as suspects in any sex-related case, whether or not a crime had occurred.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly expressed concern that this practice was “libelous” and did not adhere to “standard and appropriate law enforcement procedures, and potentially violated due process.” Signa allegedly “became upset” with Smith and told him to “let the district attorney figure out who is guilty and who is not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa also allegedly said “UCPD could not afford the political scrutiny.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD members also allegedly created a “secret log” for sexual or domestic violence cases, which all officers in the department had access to. Officers were allegedly “not to disclose knowledge of this log within their reports to avoid discovery.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported concerns of the secret log to Olson and Farley. Olson allegedly said he would “look into” the concerns. Court documents say this secret log still exists within the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of 2016, Signa allegedly ordered Smith to continue training “an African American officer, despite the fact that the Officer was not meeting the training standards.” Signa allegedly said “it was a politically sensitive matter because the officer was black,” citing Olson’s desire for greater diversity in the department. Smith allegedly reported Signa’s statements to UCPD staff, but no action was taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2017, Smith was allegedly assigned to a “mutual aid response” at UC Berkeley for the upcoming campus appearance from Milo Yiannopoulos. While at the event, UC Berkeley police officers allegedly “refused to allow the officers assisting from various U.C. Police Departments” to intervene with “students and civilians [who] were being brutally beaten by the anarchists.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the events at UC Berkeley and his concerns to Olson and was questioned by Olson upon his return from UC Berkeley. Olson allegedly “received a call from U.C. Berkeley Police Chief Margo Bennett,” who yelled at Olson and was “furious” with Smith for voicing concerns regarding the Milo Yiannopoulos event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further incidents regarding Signa can be viewed on pages 5 through 10 of the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Ryan Hashimoto </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Smith served as sergeant for UCPD, he allegedly “reported several violations of policy and law to Signa,” which continued to create points of retaliation against Smith. Some of those violations pertained to Officer Hashimoto’s alleged misconduct in the office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto allegedly “made multiple cartoon videos” of officers, crime victims, citizens, university officials and employees in which he “used his own voice to play the character of each person.” At times, the videos “were discriminatory toward several protected classes of persons.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto allegedly created a video depicting an officer in the department – referred to as “Officer M” in the complaint – who was known to allegedly contact “female sexual assault victims unsolicited,” as well as sexual assault advocates from the Women’s Center. The video allegedly “depicts the advocates yelling ‘Rape!’ at the victims and forcing the victims to make sexual assault reports.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly reported Officer M to Signa after Smith discovered that “Officer M was having sexual assault advocates call his personal phone directly to report cases” without notifying a dispatch or supervisor. Smith ordered Officer M to stop this practice. UCPD allegedly took no action regarding Officer M.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto’s alleged videos also depicted Chancellor Yang with Officer Hashimoto using a “Chinese accent, making derogatory and inappropriate statements.” Hashimoto also allegedly mocked an African-American dispatcher through “videos and in person impersonations.” Hashimoto’s alleged impersonations of the dispatcher included mockery of the dispatcher “speaking and eating food.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On another occasion, Hashimoto allegedly acted out “a fictional situation where the dispatcher was playing with a large black dildo that Hashimoto named ‘King Kong Dong.’” Officer Hashimoto allegedly “often walked into different areas of the UCPD and would yell ‘King Kong Dong’ while impersonating the dispatchers voice. He would position his forearm in front of his groin area, and then slap his arm on desktops as if he was slapping a dildo on the desktop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto also allegedly “inappropriately joked” and stated to UCPD staff “that the victim in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/rape-2014-daniel-chen-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Chen rape and kidnap case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contracted herpes from the suspect,” while UCPD was conducting the investigation. Officer Hashimoto allegedly “mocked the victim’s Asian accent, and in the accent stated: ‘I have herpes on my pussy.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2018, while Smith was working in Montecito following the Thomas Fire and the Montecito mudslides, he was shown a recording allegedly made by Hashimoto in which Hashimoto was verbally “mocking an evidence video and audio recording” related to the sexual assault, sodomy, kidnapping and robbery case of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/trial-for-iv-menus-owner-will-begin-in-late-july/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">v.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Patrick Galoustian</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this video – a tape of Galoustian allegedly “sexual[ly] assaulting a transvestite victim” – Hashimoto allegedly mocked Galoustian’s accent in a voice-over, made sexual references to the victim and made “statements in essence of rubbing their (Galoustian and the trans victim’s penis’ together).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the video to UCPD on Jan. 27, 2018. At the time, Olson and Lieutenant Millard allegedly confirmed that they were “aware of the recording.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Tiffany Little and Officer Michael Little </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also reported alleged misconduct from married UCPD officers Tiffany and Michael Little, who “frequently left their assigned patrol areas while on duty and traveled to their personal residence in Goleta using UCPD vehicles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Littles would also allegedly “stay at their residences for extended periods of time, fail to answer calls for service, and ask other officers to handle calls for service for them.” The suit alleges that the Littles’ actions “are a violation of policy and a theft of funds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court documents, Officer Michael Little also allegedly “talked about his fantasy to have a black man try to steal his wallet so he can ‘fucking shoot him in the fucking face.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Michael Little allegedly approached Smith and other officers and “related a fictitious story about how he (Little) is walking through a parking lot and a black man approaches him and tries to rob him of his wallet. Little would then mimic responding by stating, ‘How about I shoot you in the fucking face!’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would then allegedly “slightly draw his firearm from the holster as if he was going to draw his weapon” while reciting the story.

Other officers also allegedly “confided” their concerns about Smith in Signa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa expressed concern about the “impropriety” of favoritism in the department and was later allegedly retaliated against at a lunch in or around August 2016. Sergeant Romero “attacked Signa’s position as Patrol Lieutenant, stating that the other sergeants were upset with Signa’s leadership style and were contemplating a vote of no confidence in Signa,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the lunch, Lieutenant Signa allegedly met with each of the six sergeants, excluding Sergeants Romero and Smith, during which “none of the sergeants expressed discontent with Signa’s leadership” or the intention to “submit a vote of no confidence against Signa,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after, Signa was “transferred from Patrol Lieutenant to Administrative Lieutenant,” which was seen as “punishment against Signa for not ‘falling in line’ with the ‘Good Ole Boys’ Club,’” court documents state.</span></p>\n<p><b>The 2017 Internal Affairs Investigation </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In or around September 2017, court documents state that UCPD Corporal Tiffany Little “submitted a letter of complaint alleging improper and possibly unlawful conduct by Smith.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are allegations that were included in the complaint, according to court documents:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly had “an extra-marital affair” with a subordinate UCPD officer; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith “covered up” for an automobile accident in which the subordinate officer was driving a UCPD vehicle on campus;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith was involved in an alleged hit-and-run automobile accident in which he “hit a parked car” with a UCPD vehicle;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly used police lights and sirens “to get through heavy traffic” in order to attend “a free breakfast,” while visiting UC Los Angeles;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly used UCPD resources to visit the subordinate officer in Santa Cruz;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Little, with her husband UCPD Officer Michael Little, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\">also filed a suit against several members of the UCPD on March 29 on similar charges</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millard was allegedly tasked with investigating this complaint and shared concerns with Signa “about how the IA investigation might affect his friendship with Smith,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith went on leave in or around the middle of 2017 and by the end of that year received a job at the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olson, Farley and Millard allegedly said during several meetings that “having Smith get the alternate position was the easiest solution to the issues the department was facing,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents allege that the “woefully inadequate” investigation was closed right before Smith left UCPD toward the end of 2017 so the investigation would “not impede his ability to get the job” at the Office of Emergency Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith was also allegedly treated to “a celebratory farewell lunch” and continued to have lunch with Olson, Millard and Romero after leaving the department. </span></p>\n<p><b>Signa’s Concerns and Alleged Retaliation: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa allegedly reported concerns about Smith and overall UCPD “propriety” to Olson and Farley.

The alleged retaliations included: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from “key meetings” essential for Signa’s job duties; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not being able to email Olson without notifying Farley as well and receiving criticism for not adequately communicating with Olson; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bullying, harassing, publicly criticizing and blaming Signa in front of other officers and for unfounded reasons”;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandatory meetings with Farley to “check-in,” in which “Signa received contradictory directives and conflicting information”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from UCPD social events;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Resistance” from Olson to meet in private with Signa;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from “leadership, promotional and learning opportunities”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pressure to resign early. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>University Response</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa filed a complaint with Human Resources in or around May 2018 about “his departmental concerns and the retaliation he faced for trying to voice them.” Signa met with Cynthia Señeriz, the acting director, human resources and compensation manager at UCSB, who allegedly told Signa “she would have someone follow up with him,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa allegedly went on stress leave on or around June 1, 2018.

her time, according to a statement released by UC President Janet Napolitano on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“We were extremely honored and fortunate to have Ellen serve on the UC Board of Regents where her expertise and passion for quality education… helped us navigate complex issues facing the university,” Napolitano said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Before sitting on the board, she held a seat in Congress, worked on Wall Street for 14 years and was one of the first female members of the New York Stock Exchange, according to the UC Regents website.</p>\n<p>While in Congress, Tauscher served in several subcommittees, including within the Strategic Forces Subcommittee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee.</p>\n<p>Tauscher also received her bachelor’s degree in early childhood development from Seton Hall University.</p>\n<p>Governor Gavin Newsom also released a statement on Tauscher’s passing, stating Tauscher “blazed trails in business and in the halls of Congress” and “held her own at some of the world’s toughest negotiating tables.”</p>\n<p>In their statements, both Gavin and Napolitano spoke about Tauscher’s “grace” during pressing times.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein described Tauscher as “brilliant, gracious and generous” in a statement she released after Tauscher’s death.</p>\n<p>“She had a knack for getting to the bottom of an issue smartly but also in ways that people could really understand. She truly loved her country and it was an honor to work with her,” Feinstein said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Tauscher joined the Board of Regents in June 2017 after being appointed by former California Governor Jerry Brown. She was one of 17 other appointed regents who sat on the board, in addition to Napolitano.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Barbara’s Pan Asian Network and Indus, an on-campus group for South Asian culture and awareness, joined hands to put on a vigil attended by about 80 people. Throughout the vigil, organizers and speakers brought to light both the stories of the people who died as well as the strength, resilience and compassion of the Sri Lankan community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight speakers took the stage that night, which included a handful of UCSB students as well as a high school student from the Santa Barbara area. Several faculty members and administrators also took time to share their sentiments, including Zaveeni Khan-Marcus, director of the MultiCultural Center, Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vigil organizers passed out small, battery-operated blue light candles, which attendees switched on as they were placed in their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Dhishal Jayasinghe was one of the first to take the stage, during which he spoke about his childhood and various identities as a “Singhalese, Buddhist, Sri Lankan, American, asylum seeker who came here at the age of three years old fleeing war.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jayasinghe described his gratefulness for the people who showed up to support the bombing victims and urged the audience members to reject the destructive ideals of nationalism and instead opt for unity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Shobha Ambi, who spoke after Jayasinghe, shared her “frustration and sadness” with the crowd, tearing up as she expressed her disbelief at the scale of the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Any life lost is heartbreaking enough, but 253 lives is overwhelming on an entirely different level,” Ambi said. “My heart hurts for the victims whose lives were taken away so unjustly and for their families who are forced to deal with the consequences.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ambi recounted the stories of some of those who lost their lives on April 21, including that of an 11-year-old child. Ambi said she was disappointed by the lack of focus she saw on the victims of the attack, with more attention seeming to go toward the attackers and the Sri Lankan government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Does no one comprehend the death of how many lives were ripped away just four days ago? 253 lives,” Ambi said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She echoed sentiments similar to that of Jayasinghe, stating that one doesn’t need to be Sri Lankan to understand the tragedy suffered by the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These weren’t just the lives of Sri Lankans that were taken away. These were the lives of human beings,” Ambi said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87792\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/a-vigil-goer-holding-the-led-candle-distributed-by-the-organizer/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-87792\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87792\" data-attachment-id=\"87792\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/a-vigil-goer-holding-the-led-candle-distributed-by-the-organizer/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1313&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1313\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"A vigil goer holding the LED candle distributed by the organizer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=888%2C583&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87792\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=888%2C583\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87792\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vigil organizers passed out blue light candles. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB student, Huda Faiz, took the stage next, expressing her love for Sri Lanka at  the beginning of her speech. Faiz said that now, many people know her home only for the tragedies that have taken place there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to Faiz, it’s something much different. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sri Lanka to you is 253 lives that were lost and counting,” she said. “But Sri Lanka to me is the birds singing at the break of dawn. It’s the old man selling vegetables rolling his cart down my street calling for buyers at 6 a.m. It’s the fresh smell of morning tea and home-cooked coconut rice wafting from my aunt’s kitchen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said the community of Sri Lanka is one that is built upon principles of love, tolerance, acceptance and resilience.

Bluffs Report released in March 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposed changes to the I.V. Bluff Policy follow an instance in which <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/\">15 feet of the cliff between 6653 and 6663 Del Playa Drive collapsed</a> in a short period in January 2017, according to the report. This collapse forced out 28 residents from the surrounding properties after a portion of the balcony crumbled off the cliff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This “single-event failure” — an event where the most cliff erosion occurs in a single point in time, as opposed to erosion over time — exceeded the current requirement of five feet and “raised concern regarding the current policy for structure setbacks, which includes an assumption that a single bluff failure will be no more than five feet,” according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, not all properties would be affected by the new proposal, Abolhoda noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to site-specific conditions of property, the threshold distance can be different for each property, depending on the type of foundation of the building, how close the building is to the property line and how close the south side of the building is to the cliff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Property owners would be able to submit geotechnical evaluation reports to sidestep having to make renovations or cutbacks to the building, so long as the building meets the division’s requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we know that site-to-site situations can vary, we are asking that property owners hire a geotechnical engineer to evaluate their specific condition and let us know,” Abolhoda said. “[They can then] offer us a geotechnical report if they believe the 15 feet that would be the basis of our new policy is not really applicable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once we get that report, we get other geotechnical engineers to review it and see if it’s acceptable, and if it’s acceptable then the policy would be based on a single event that is going to happen in that specific site. That’s how our policies are being revised.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buildings with shallow foundations, about 24 to 32 inches deep, would be less likely to meet the division’s building safety requirements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buildings with caisson foundations in good shape have a better chance of sliding by the new policy, but a “series of triggers” would be established to monitor the integrity of the foundation and the safety of the building over time. The triggers would designate points in erosion which would render the support structures ineffective and require property owners to address the conditions of the building at that time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a building is less than 15 feet from the bluff, the property would be placed on a watch list to be “monitored on a continuing basis for bluff retreat and building proximity,” according to the report. The property owners would also be notified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can adjust our policy according to what is considered the most prevalent single-event failure that can be experienced on that site,” Abolhoda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a building comes within 10 feet of the bluff, the property owner will be issued an official “Notice of Violation” and will be required to address the “noncompliant conditions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If nothing is done to address the threshold violation, the property owner would be fined and receive a “Notice of Non-Compliance,” according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the event that a building  comes within five feet of the bluff, the property owner may be issued a “Notice and Order to Vacate Building and Abate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it is determined that the property does not meet the safety threshold, the property owner has several options.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The owner can “cut the building back a minimum of 30 feet,” but would also be allowed to do smaller cutbacks on a “case-by-case basis.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They could also maintain the building in its current condition if a geotechnical engineering report proves the building is safe to live in. Property owners would still need a “monitoring and abatement plan” prepared by a civil or structural engineer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A third option is foundation strengthening, which could also allow property owners to maintain the existing structure through the “underpinning of shallow foundations,” anchoring of existing foundations or other methods, according to the report. Property owners would need reports from geotechnical and structural engineers to oversee the modifications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building and safety division is holding a meeting with property owners on May 2 at the planning commission room on 123 E Anapamu Street to discuss concerns and “have a discussion about moving forward with new policy,” Abolhoda said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not rushing to this, and we want everyone to understand what we are asking, and we do not want to create a false panic,” Abolhoda said. “Safety is the primary reason for this change of policy.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Graduate Student Association (APIGSA) and the Asian American Studies Department spoke about their experiences at the university and grievances they hold with the university. </span></p>\n<p><span

population identifies as Asian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smita Narasimhan, social media coordinator for Pan Asian Network, talked about the failure of the university to recognize the many identities within the label of Asian or Asian American. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We come from so many diverse cultures, languages, religions and we need to embrace all of that, but by designating all of us under one umbrella with one word, that’s taking all those differences away,” Narasimhan said during the rally. </span></p>\n<p><span

marched into Cheadle Hall and chanted in protest while ascending the stairs to the fifth floor, where Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Executive Assistant in the Office of the Chancellor Diane O’Brien received the list of demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pan Asian Network members then listed the staff they required to be present at the meeting and requested that a meeting to discuss the demands with the Chancellor Henry T.

It’s gonna be more rallies, more advocacy, greater activism on campus and we won’t be silent. We’re not gonna let this go,” Anderson said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Anderson, the demands come down to an essential problem with how the Asian and Asian-American communities are seen on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are invisible. Our needs aren’t being met and people just assume that we’re gonna be okay because it is a reinforcement of the model minority idea that Asian and Asian-American students are gonna make do.

Safe Committee, aiming to both recognize April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month and set a new tone for survivorship in I.V., according to Spencer Brandt, president of the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</p>\n<p>“[Sexual violence] is something that our community knows and takes very seriously already, but it was also important to try to debunk some of the myths that are around sexual violence both when it comes to law enforcement, when it comes to who can be made into a victim or survivor of sexual violence,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The video series tackles attitudes toward sexual assault with a three-pronged approach, focusing on the role and support of law enforcement, prosecutors, friends and family during survivors’ times of turmoil. Each video includes members from the aforementioned communities discussing support for survivors in the legal and healing processes.</p>\n<p>I.V. Safe Committee is a collaborative group composed of legal and government offices in I.V. and Santa Barbara. The committee is made up of the I.V. CSD, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office, UCPD, SBSO, Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) and more.</p>\n<p>The committee and Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), a UCSB student group advocating for survivor resources and ending sexual violence, worked on the videos together over the last months.</p>\n<p>The videos were released just in time for April, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>One of Brandt’s hopes was that the videos would do more to encourage survivors to come forward with their experiences. He said this is an important goal in addressing and solving sexual violence in the community.</p>\n<p>“If we do not have more people feel comfortable going through and doing that, then it’s going to continue to be very difficult to solve a lot of these cases, and that really is the bottom line,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Numbers from UCSB’s Title IX Office showed that there had been 320 individual reports of sexual violence in 2018, 140 instances of sexual harassment, 18 instances of sexual discrimination and 133 instances labeled “other.”</p>\n<p>But Brandt noted the numbers of survivors who report incidents of sexual violence is far less than the number of people who actually experience it.</p>\n<p>“The harsh reality is that sexual violence is both incredibly prevalent in the community and peer-reviewed scientific studies have shown that the likelihood of survivors coming forward and reporting their assault to either a law enforcement agency or through other avenues is incredibly low,” Brandt said. “We’re looking at a number of about 10 or 20%.”</p>\n<p>For Emily Montalvo-Telford, director of SASA, it was important that the working process of the videos included input from student voices, especially considering the intended audience of the videos.</p>\n<p>“It’s always best to work with the community that you’re trying to send a message to and hearing [student] voices as a part of the conversation,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The conversation around sexual violence necessitated change, and the video series is a step in a better direction toward helping survivors by leaving behind the phrase “we believe survivors” for something more encompassing, Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“For me personally, believing survivors is a necessary step, but it’s not enough. It’s not sufficient. So the concept of ‘we stand with survivors’ is a commitment to support and a commitment to consistent allyship,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The videos is just one of many actions taken by I.V. community to create a safe environment for survivors and residents in general, Brandt said. This includes the hiring of an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">interpersonal violence investigator</a> in November 2018 and the signing of agreement between I.V.

id=\"caption-attachment-86992\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The union last went on strike on March. 20. <em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unfair labor practice charge, filed by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) 3229, alleges that the University of California attempted to stifle the union’s “ability to strike, to silence its voice, and to diminish its ranks,” according to the document submitted to the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PERB is the government agency responsible for regulating the bargaining statuses for public schools, universities, public employees and other government employees, according to the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.perb.ca.gov\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charge claims that UC violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act, which protects UC workers’ rights to unionize and allows collective bargaining to negotiate their own wages, benefits and working conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a systemic pattern of intimidation and creating an atmosphere of fear in the workplace,” AFSCME spokesperson John de los Angeles said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the most recent incidents happened during the UC campus-wide union strike on March 20, during which workers received citations from police, a consequence of protesting that workers had not previously experienced from UC, said de los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The workers] were hitting the picket line, making noise, but they always do and all of a sudden UCPD is now threatening them with police citations,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For them to change that expectation…  [creates] a sense of hesitance for some of our workers to come forward, voice concerns and even participate in these activities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The filing lists examples of UC’s alleged failure to protect workers’ rights to protest, such as “workplace retaliation and police citation” and “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">condoning the violent physical assault of striking workers on the picket line.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The filing goes into specific details about incidents in which UC workers experienced violence, threats of arrest and discouragement from protesting. The filing also listed incidents where UC management offered rewards to workers not participating in strikes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the incidents included a UC Davis supervisor’s </span><a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2019/01/11/video-shows-alleged-uc-davis-employee-attack-afscme-3299-strikers-in-october/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attack</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on AFSCME strikers in Oct. 2018, UC Labor Relations misleading and intimidating communications to union employees and UC Police at UCSB and UC Los Angeles threatening workers with citations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These incidents and others surrounding the UC campus-wide protest on March 20 are a sign of the university’s attempt to subvert union efforts, de los Angeles said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But these actions have a greater toll on union workers that just stifling protests, he added.</span></p>\n<p>“When the university is allowed to engage in these activities without consequences, the ultimate effect is actually a violation of workers’ rights and these are rights that are protected by state law,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re merely drawing attention to the fact that the university is openly and blatantly violating state law.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME’s recent strikes are part of a now three-year negotiation with UC for higher wages and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But UC has remained steadfast in its position on “AFSCME’s unreasonable demands for wage increases,</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Doan, spokesperson and director of media relations for UC, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want raises that are nearly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">triple</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> those given to other UC employees,” Doan said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope AFSCME leaders will channel more time and effort into actual bargaining.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of March 27, the UC had not received a copy of the charges and could not comment on them or determine whether there was “any merit to these allegations,” Doan said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME leadership announced Friday that another strike will be taking place on April 10 in protest against UC’s conduct referred to in the suit.</span></p>\n<p>A copy of the filing in full can be read below: <object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-0325-Unfair-Practice-Charge-w-Exhs.-A-J-Redacted.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-0325-Unfair-Practice-Charge-w-Exhs.-A-J-Redacted.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yang sent a message to the BSU Demands Team yesterday, promising funding for BSU’s eight proposed positions within the office, $55,000 annually for BSU programs and that the university would “work toward the vision of a Center for Black Student Development over the next several years,” according to the message.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These proposals were part of the most recent <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\">set of demands</a> BSU released to the university in February, but built upon over 50 years of efforts from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For BSU President Mariyah Lewis and BSU Demands Team leader Samantha Sanchez, seeing the fulfillment of these demands warranted a moment for the two to pause from their efforts and celebrate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I cried for about two and a half hours,” Sanchez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The commitment the university made to the Black student community by fulfilling these demands speaks to a greater awareness of Black students and their unique needs as a student community on campus, Lewis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a good feeling to say the least, to know the administration is pushing for us and striving for better support of Black students on campus,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang said BSU’s demands represent a vital aspect of university’s commitments, which include </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“creating a culture that affirms the intrinsic dignity in each of us, celebrating differences, and making UC Santa Barbara an inclusive environment in which to live, work, and learn,” he wrote in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email to Black student groups and community members, Sanchez acknowledged the strides made by UCSB administrators in its support of Black students, noting that these commitments are a symbol of courage as well as progress toward equity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes strong leadership and courage on the behalf of administration to understand and implement a structure to repair those deficits and restore the Black community’s faith in the education system. Today, our university administration displayed both this leadership and courage,” Sanchez wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, Sanchez said the fruition of these demands will pave the way for “monumental initiatives across the UC system to create greater access to higher institutions of learning and overall achievement for Black people and people of color.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanchez said that the hiring process for positions in the Office of Black Student Development can start immediately. The positions will be developed within the Division of Student Affairs, and  hiring will be led by BSU members and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The positions within the office include a director, an assistant director, two academic support counselors, a recruitment and retention specialist, a coordinator of Black student life and two advocacy counselors. The budget for the positions totaled about $900,000, according to BSU’s list of demands, and will be provided by the Chancellor’s Office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Lewis and Sanchez emphasized that their work to help the Black student community is not over. Changes are still needed within universities to create equity among minority student populations, and BSU is far from short of ideas for how this change can happen, Lewis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many more things that we can imagine.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Students and faculty can search for open access online, use a inter-library loan or asking a librarian for more options.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Day in and day out, our librarians are finding content that’s behind paywalls, content that is out there that students, faculty [and] the UCSB community need to find,” Rick Stockwood, communications and marketing manager at the UCSB library, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone stumbles across a paywall like we all do almost everyday, trying to reach something, the librarians are here to help find that content.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Librarians at UC libraries are also able to purchase specific articles for access using the budget that would normally go to funding the contract with Elsevier, according to Antelman.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the library acquisition budget will also go to investing in open access initiatives elsewhere and working with a subcommittee of the Academic Senate to create a fund to facilitate open access of UC research articles, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC researchers have to pay an article processing charge to Elsevier in order to enable open access to their articles, which Antelman said usually costs around $3,000. This fund would help researchers cover this cost.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Through the subscription dollars the library is currently paying, we would help subsidize those fees and they would be lower so that if the researcher wanted to publish open access, they would pay much less,” Antelman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The push for open access of UC research articles started in 2013 when the UC Academic Senate adopted a policy which iterated UC’s commitment to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible,” according to the official policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will soon sign onto an “</span><a href=\"https://oa2020.org/mission/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expression of Interest,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” according to Antelman, which asserts the importance of creating open access for research article and leaving the subscription model of the industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other UC signatories of the document include UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Los Angeles and most recently UC San Diego. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC isn’t completely closing to door to Elsevier, however. UC still retains access to most articles from Elsevier before 2019 and room remains for more negotiations in the future, Antelman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re hopeful that over time, Elsevier will possibly come back with another proposal and that we could possibly have a successful deal concluded, but at this point, it doesn’t look like that will happen anytime soon.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
