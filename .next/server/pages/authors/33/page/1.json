One young woman fell and hit her head on a rock, and another young woman fell from a cliff located in the 6800 block of Del Playa “during a domestic dispute.” Neither sustained fatal injuries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the arrests were for disorderly conduct due to alcohol, as seen in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ arrest map. A few other individuals were arrested for assault, vandalism or petty theft, and one individual was arrested for sodomy by force/violence/fear, use of force with great bodily injury and violation of probation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two Deltopia attendees were also arrested in I.V. late Sunday night for armed robbery, among other charges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of direct police intervention, the authorities also stopped and arrested 18-year-old De’shon Wilson, an Oregon native, for allegedly knocking a young man unconscious in the 6500 block of Del Playa, according to the report. Wilson was subsequently kept at Santa Barbara County Jail on assault charges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputies from SBSO and the UCPD also reportedly shut down around 10 parties that day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deltopia finally drew to a close in the evening as, per the report, the 6 p.m. noise ordinance kicked in and thousands of students emptied out of I.V. and flocked to The Warm Up concert hosted by UCSB at the Thunderdome.

This year, the count reported 670 sheltered and 1,133 unsheltered individuals.</p>\n<p>Additionally, 42% of the 1,133 unsheltered individuals lived in their vehicles. According to the report, the CoC interpreted this data with the help of new technologies involved in the count and demographic information provided from the New Beginnings Safe Parking Program.</p>\n<p>The program provides support and safe overnight parking for houseless individuals or families living in their vehicles, <a href=\"https://sbnbcc.org/safe-parking/\">according to the official Safe Parking page on the New Beginnings Counseling Center’s official website. </a></p>\n<p>The report also revealed, through survey questions about individuals’ last permanent residence, that the majority of the houseless population is local – meaning those individuals became houseless while living in Santa Barbara. Over 75% of current houseless people became houseless during their time of residence in Santa Barbara and 60% have resided in the county for more than 10 years, if not most of their lives.</p>\n<p>In response to the count, the County is currently drafting a plan to address houselessness, according to the count press release.</p>\n<p>“More and more, you’ll read about how the state of California is actually starting to really invest in solutions to homelessness and affordable housing,” Emily Allen, program director at United Way of Northern Santa Barbara County, said. “They are also requiring that communities have you know a P.I.T. count and that they have a plan in place and that they have strategies for evaluating how effective programs are.”</p>\n<p>The count is conducted by community volunteers recruited by the Northern Santa Barbara County United Way Home for Good, the organization which carries out the count, according to the press release. Volunteers attended a training session and then set out for the count at 5 a.m. on Jan. 2. This year, almost 450 volunteers showed up for the count in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Volunteers conducted “complete counts” and surveys, in which the volunteers, sometimes with the help of homeless guides, covered every census tract in the county, save for the Channel Islands and certain parts of the Los Padres National Forest.</p>\n<p>“Everybody is trained to either administer the survey where we ask people certain HUD-required questions, or if [a homeless person] says ‘I don’t wanna do the survey’ you’re still on your smartphone using an app,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>Volunteers could also conduct observational surveys instead of direct surveys and questioning in cases where houseless people were not comfortable answering questions.</p>\n<p>Surveying the houseless population provides insight about the conditions of houseless across communities, Allen said.</p>\n<p>“This surveying helps us to understand… who’s experiencing homelessness is fairly similar from community to community,” she said.</p>\n<p>The surveys also help United Way to better understand the varying needs of houseless individuals and how to best help them, Allen said.</p>\n<p>“We also know that the solutions are housing and supportive services and a lot of the people that do survey, they do need different types of supportive service with their housing,” she added.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County also took part in the 100,000 Homes Campaign, a country-wide effort in 2011 to create “by-name” lists of houseless people, pinpoint who the most vulnerable populations, and to ultimately house 100,000 people, Allen said.</p>\n<p>Allen and other community organizations in the Santa Barbara County “were a part of that effort… and from that we’ve continued feeling like it was important to have a lot of volunteers engaged in the Count and make sure that we were really getting information about what was going on in our community,” hence the creation of the SB County’s Home for Good program.</p>\n<p>Following the first count in 2011, one goal of the program has been to keep people engaged in a plethora of ways even after the official P.I.T. Count, in ways that will hopefully address the needs revealed by the report.</p>\n<p>“So I would say [the P.I.T Count is] not just for the federal government,” Allen said. She stated that “more and more it’s also the state government” that has begun taking a closer look at the roots and solutions to houselessness.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/","id":3720,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[3719,3718,3717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The class required students to design petitions based on their personal passions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Karmes-Wainer, that passion was healthy eating. Her health journey over the past year inspired her to make healthy eating options more accessible for UCSB students as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t believe that we have enough restaurants or establishments to build healthy, nutritious meals, and even if they seem healthy, they’re not always the healthiest option,” Karmes-Wainer said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer used the petition as a way to gauge the community’s response to the hot bar as a potential senate project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What first began as a class project quickly transformed into a platform for students with a variety of dietary restrictions and preferences to voice their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I engaged people from other communities that I didn’t realize that I was targeting as well,” Karmes-Wainer said. “That’s the point of my position, is to hear from all my different constituents.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer’s petition elicited plenty of responses from its post on UCSB’s Free &amp; For Sale page on Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robert Moser, a fourth-year environmental studies major at UCSB, said his dietary restrictions made finding food on campus difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a celiac, it’s hard to find many gluten-free meal options on campus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just random misc snack items. As a campus senator, it would be cool if you could advocate for more meal options for those with dietary restrictions,” Moser wrote in a comment in response to Karmes-Wainer’s post.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer hopes to make the bar environmentally friendly as well by using locally-sourced produce </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an idea partially borrowed from the Isla Vista Food Co-op’s model </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and compostable to-go boxes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Wednesday, around 230 people have signed the petition, but the hot food bar still remains in its initial stages. Karmes-Wainer noted that the construction of the bar would not be completed by the end of her term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m dedicated to go through with the project throughout my senior year even though I won’t be on senate,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Isabell Liu is a staff writer at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85907\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85907\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/","id":3031,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[3030,3029,3028],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CalFresh Team Announces Changes in SNAP Benefits Caused By Gov.

In the email, the team explained that the lack of appropriations caused by the government shutdown means the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would have to create an alternate plan to provide benefits to low-income participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USDA’s Continuing Resolution, which allotted funding the USDA and its nutrition programs, expired on Dec. 21 and provided funding through the month of January. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To provide benefits during February, the USDA will rely on a provision of the resolution that allows the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.) and other similar programs to “incur obligations for program operations within 30 days of the CR’s expiration,” according to </span><a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/pressrelease/2019/000319\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the USDA website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other programs affected by the government shutdown include the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, child nutrition programs and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those already enrolled in the CalFresh program at UCSB are set to receive their February allotments sometime in mid to late January, according to the email. Participants are expected to budget accordingly so that their funds will endure through the month of February.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB CalFresh Team also outlined a short list of important reminders for students already enrolled in or intending to enroll in the CalFresh program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email urged participants intending to recertify to get their paperwork turned in as soon as possible so that they’ll be able to receive their early allotments for the month of February. If they turned in their re-certifying paperwork after Jan. 16, they’ll receive their February funds between Feb. 1 and Feb. 10 if “contingency funds are still available.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New clients who apply or are deemed eligible after Jan. 20 will receive their CalFresh allotment in February, provided funds are still available, the email stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email also urged students interested in applying for CalFresh to still visit an advocate or attend the CalFresh Enrollment Party in the MultiCultural Center on Jan. 23 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other UCSB programs targeting food insecurity as well as on-campus nutrition will still be up and

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The products are located in all of the Chi-5 residence halls, including San Nicholas Hall (above). <em>Courtesy of Wiki Commons</em></p></div>\n<p>The program is currently limited to the Channel Island 5 residence halls – Anacapa Hall, Santa Cruz Hall, Santa Rosa Hall, San Miguel Hall and San Nicholas Hall – but hopes to expand to Manzanita Village and the Santa Catalina Towers during Winter Quarter 2019.</p>\n<p>Santa Cruz Hall Representative-At-Large Michelle Chang first proposed the idea during the 2017-2018 school year. The initiative was continued this year by Programming Vice President Austin Rowe of the Residential Housing Association (RHA).</p>\n<p>Rowe says the point of the Period Pantry is simple: to “provide a large amount of free menstrual hygiene products in all female-identified and gender-neutral restrooms in the residence halls for anyone who needs them to use.”</p>\n<p>The program provides plastic boxes, located in each of the Channel Island 5 residence halls, stocked with a variety of period products for residents.</p>\n<p>According to Rowe, the Pantry began last year in San Nicolas and San Miguel, but it wasn’t until Fall Quarter 2018 that the program began in full with the addition of Period Peers. The peers are student volunteers who are responsible for restocking the restrooms daily.</p>\n<p>Each volunteer is assigned to a particular restroom in their respective residential halls. They have a bag of excess pads and tampons distributed by RHA at the ready so they can restock the boxes as regularly as possible.</p>\n<p>The Period Peer program is completely volunteer-based. Kaitlyn Medland, San Miguel RHA President and member of the Internal Committee for the Period Pantry, was in charge of gathering volunteers for the program in San Miguel Hall.</p>\n<p>The selection process was very much on a first come, first served basis, Medland said.</p>\n<p>Medland and Rowe both described the implementation of the Period Pantry as an administrative and student-led process.</p>\n<p>After Chang’s initial proposal, all the presidents, representatives-at-large and other special positions from each residential hall gathered to discuss the motion and vote for whether it would receive RHA funding or not.</p>\n<p>The members ultimately voted yes, Medland said.</p>\n<p>“The way I see it, the Period Pantry is making the most of our residents’ funds, giving them easy access to a wide range of supplies,” Rowe said.</p>\n<p>And thus far, it seems that students are on board with the program, Medland said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve actually heard a lot of people say that it’s really neat that we’re offering these supplies,” she said. “We have the free condom boxes and yet we [didn’t] have free menstrual supplies even though … you can’t stop your period.”</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-84938\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Wikicommons</p></div>\n<p>According to CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, the Arbor is the first store on the UCSB campus at which students can use CalFresh.</p>\n<p>CalFresh, also known as the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.), gives eligible individuals electronically distributed monetary benefits every month which can be spent at specified local markets or grocery stores, according to the official website of the California Department of Social Services.</p>\n<p>The website also states that participants of the program are administered Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Cards which they can use to purchase food items at stores that accept CalFresh.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB, we estimate that about 10,000 students are eligible for CalFresh, and if you’re eligible, you may get up to $192 a month,” Melissa Fontaine, the food security coordinator at UCSB, said.</p>\n<p>During the 2016-17 academic school year, the UCSB CalFresh Team enrolled roughly 600 students in CalFresh, and 3,000 students in the following year, according to Fontaine.</p>\n<p>This year the CalFresh team hopes to enroll 6,000 students in the program by the end of Spring Quarter, Fontaine said.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor happened largely because the UCSB Sustainability Program saw student need for more affordable food options.</p>\n<p>UCSB CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, a fourth-year psychology major, echoed this sentiment both as a representative of CalFresh and a participant in the program.</p>\n<p>“I actually grew up with food stamps, so I’m very familiar with the CalFresh program,” Perez said. “Without food stamps, I don’t think my family would’ve gotten through, especially since I come from a low-income household.”</p>\n<p>Now, as a UCSB student, Perez notes that CalFresh provides a new mobility and convenience to students that may not have been able to afford grabbing a quick snack in between classes at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>“Especially during midterms or maybe finals or maybe throughout the day, students sometimes don’t have time to go grocery shopping or don’t have time to go get a snack at home,” she said.</p>\n<p>Christian Ortiz Gonzalez, a fifth-year sociology and german studies major, was also heavily involved in bringing CalFresh to the school.</p>\n<p>“I decided to work on getting EBT accepted at UCSB because I saw a dire need for it,” Ortiz Gonzalez said in an email to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Ortiz Gonzalez said he worked with several UCSB administrators and staff to help implement the program on campus.</p>\n<p>The new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor also follows a recent shift in the on-campus stigma surrounding the CalFresh program, which resulted from effective tabling and campaigning on the part of the CalFresh team, Perez said.</p>\n<p>“I think now, to be honest, UCSB has normalized what CalFresh is…I’ve heard a lot of people say, ‘Hey, how have do you not have CalFresh,’ like ‘You need to get on CalFresh.’”</p>\n<p>Fontaine stated she wanted to wait until the Arbor staff was fully trained on how to properly process CalFresh payments before making a public announcement about CalFresh’s availability.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important for the Arbor that their systems and staff are ready to go before students come to start spending their EBT CalFresh cards here at the Arbor because we want to make sure that everyone has a really great experience.”</p>\n<p>Now that CalFresh is available at the Arbor, Perez hopes the program will spread to other markets and food stores on campus.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the spread of the program will “benefit both students and stores.”</p>\n<p>“Let’s say our school year last year ended with about 3,000 students who were eligible [for CalFresh] and they were getting $120 a month [through the CalFresh program],” she said. “That becomes $360,000 that could be spent, and is likely to be spent, in the local community. And over the course of the year, that’s over four million dollars.”</p>\n<p>“That would benefit business like the Arbor, Tenaya Market, the Isla Vista Food Co-op… Their sales will increase because students now have more purchasing power, so that’s tremendous.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Nov. 15, 2018, print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated

pages</em></p></div>\n<p>The two organizations took different approaches in preparing for the Nov. 6 election. Campus Democrats focused on registering voters and getting out the vote, while College Republicans created spaces for discussion and informed students of the issues.</p>\n<p>Both groups have been actively canvassing for their respective endorsed candidates.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats has devoted efforts to register voters, according to Campus Democrats President Aisha Khan.</p>\n<p>“Preparing for midterms is [about] maintaining that focus we’ve had since our beginning to educate young people about politics, politics locally, how they can get involved and why it’s important,” Khan, a third-year political science major, said.</p>\n<p>Since January 2018, Khan said Campus Democrats has registered 9,513 voters in the Isla Vista and UCSB communities.</p>\n<p>This includes the concentrated registration efforts during UCSB’s winter and spring quarters for the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\">Measure R campaign</a>.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats members tabled in the Arbor and the University Center almost every day from the beginning of the 2018-19 school year to register voters, Khan said.</p>\n<p>They also had stations around campus and I.V. on Oct. 22, the last day to register.</p>\n<p>College Republicans does not focus on registering voters and instead focuses on providing an open forum for discussion to students about the issues and candidates, according to College Republicans President Leslie Garcia.</p>\n<p>“In the past, we’ve hosted events for people to watch the presidential debates and the Republican candidate debates,” Garcia, a fourth-year Middle East studies and political science double major, said.</p>\n<p>“I think that the purpose of our [organization] is to create a space for discourse which isn’t really found on campus.”</p>\n<p>In addition to open general meetings, College Republicans hold public forum events throughout the year, such as the event held in the Hub on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>The organization also holds speaking events and often dedicates large portions of time during those events for debate and questions.</p>\n<p>“Becoming engaged in a space where you are capable and there is an opportunity for you to debate your positions, that really does tend to [make] people [want] to be more knowledgeable and more involved in the political sphere,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>In addition to creating spaces for students to discuss and learn more about politics, both organizations have been canvassing for candidates aligned with their respective views.</p>\n<p>“One way that we have remained involved in the [upcoming] midterm elections is canvassing for Justin Fareed,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>Fareed is a Republican Congressional candidate in the 24th congressional district. The district is currently represented by Salud Carbajal, who is endorsed by the Campus Democrats.</p>\n<p>The organization has been knocking on doors and speaking to voters in Goleta and Santa Maria leading up to the election.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also gotten involved with the No On Prop 10 campaign, so we’ve been making phone calls for them about two or three times a week, about five of our members each time,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>California Proposition 10 would repeal the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1506\">Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act</a>, a state law enacted in 1995 that places limitations on the power of city governments to control rent.</p>\n<p>Now that voter registration has ended, Campus Democrats has also doubled down on campaigning for local candidates and issues.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats “has been a volunteer for local Democratic campaigns” since its inception. The organization also has close ties with the campaigns of incumbent congressman Salud Carbajal and incumbent assemblywoman Monique Limón, according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“It’s about emphasizing the importance of local politics and the power that we have here locally,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>The organization has been canvassing for its slate of endorsed candidates as well as the passing of Measure G and California Proposition 10 by calling voters and going door-to-door in Santa Barbara, Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“People get exposure to what it’s like [to work on] on a real political campaign,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Khan and Garcia both emphasized the importance of students exercising their right to vote.</p>\n<p>Garcia highlighted the importance of educated and informed voting as a key mission of College Republicans.</p>\n<p>She noted the influence of the political climate on conversations about the election with community members.</p>\n<p>“I think the majority of students are left-leaning, but I don’t think they’re so left-leaning that they’re completely shut down to discourse,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>“In the past year or two, there have been a lot of situations on campuses where events are shut down and students are harassed or assaulted because they are putting their political opinions out there. I don’t think that’s a thing that really happens here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>She said she believes elections such as the midterms can be overwhelming for first-time voters and individuals new to the U.S. political sphere.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats also keeps the age of its intended audience in mind, and the organization’s main goal is “to educate and empower young people about politics,” according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“For a lot of us, we are really new to politics so it’s a unique opportunity to have a very powerful voice and [change] something when you are brand new to it,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>“There are not that many places in the country where young people’s votes are concentrated in an area and Isla Vista is one of those places. It makes a really big difference locally.”</p>\n<p><em>The 2018 midterm elections are on Tuesday, Nov. 6.

id=\"caption-attachment-84671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UCSB Students gathered on Monday and Tuesday to mourn the lives lost in the Pittsburgh shooting. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>On Saturday morning, a gunman shouting anti-semitic slurs killed 11 people in the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, Penn.</p>\n<p>“It’s sad… and it’s hard to be reminded that there’s something about yourself that people are going to take issue with and that people are going to attack,” Olivia Lazarus, an attendee at Tuesday’s vigil hosted by Santa Barbara Hillel, said.</p>\n<p>Many other attendees shared this sentiment as they gathered at the base of Storke Tower to hear student leaders and university officials address this recent tragedy.</p>\n<p>“[UCSB is] outraged by the violence in our nation and pour out our support and care for our Jewish community here and across the nation, who have been targeted by this act of hate and terror,” UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said.</p>\n<p>“With tragedy comes the time to stand strong against the fear and bigotry and stand up for kindness, compassion and open mindedness.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang represented one of the many organizations responsible for co-hosting the event alongside Santa Barbara Hillel. The event was officially titled, “Standing With Pittsburgh Against Hate.”</p>\n<p>Miri Klein, co-director of Chabad at UCSB, also spoke at the memorial and was one of the hosts of the “Mitzvah for Pittsburgh” event in the Arbor on Monday.</p>\n<p>“Love and kindness and goodness are like steel. Hate can try and destroy that, but like steel, goodness and kindness will never be able to be destroyed. And all of us coming here together is proof that love and kindness will always prevail,” she said at the vigil.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer, External Vice President of Local Affairs for Associated Students, closed the ceremony with a reading of the names of the 11 victims and a song in her native language.</p>\n<p>“I think that you can see how the UCSB community was impacted by how many people showed up today. How many people came, of different groups to show support and stand in solidarity. I think that shows the impact that it [the synagogue shooting] made,” Meijer said.</p>\n<p>For some students, this recent tragedy may influence how they choose to vote in the midterms next Tuesday, Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>”When public officials who are trying to fight discrimination, fight gun laws and try to create stricter regulations, it’s going to make things like this happen less often,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s going to eradicate it, but it’s gonna make it happen less.”</p>\n<p>At Chabad’s table in the Arbor on Monday, the organization encouraged students to write down good deeds and add them to a board that they plan on sending to the Jewish community in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Gershon Klein explained that mitzvot, or good deeds, are a way for Jewish people to bring light to the world during times of darkness.</p>\n<p>“A mitzvah can mean different things. One of the main things it means is to be connected… we bring light from the essence of our soul outwards into the revealed world, like right here in Isla Vista,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>One of the mitzvot Gershon performed was wrapping tefillin around the arms of male students. This particular mitzvah is specifically for men, Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“This is a mitzvah which represents being in the oneness of hashem, God, down into the world. We put it opposite the heart, on top of the head, because often, our heart and our head give us different messages. The whole idea of tefillin is to bring oneness, inside of ourselves and in the world,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“So in the place where the biggest friction happens, between our emotions and our mind, we want to bind it and bring oneness to it.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Caduri, an exchange student from Germany, mourned the loss of the United States as a sanctuary for Jewish people. In Europe, Caduri said, synagogues and other Jewish facilities typically have security guards.</p>\n<p>“In the U.S. it was actually quite opposite. When you go there, everything’s open, you can just enter the room because there was no fear of danger so far. So I don’t know how it will change now,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I hope that America will [still] remain a safe place.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84669\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84669\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/","id":2210,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[2209,2208,2207],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"45-Year-Old Arrested For Attempted Burglary on Abrego Road","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2018-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Malagon reportedly told police he wanted to pick up some of the items that he stored there and that he himself didn’t live in the area.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Police arrested a 45-year-old Santa Barbara resident in Isla Vista last Tuesday for second degree attempt to commit burglary, vandalism and possession of burglary tools.</p>\n<p>The suspect, Jesus Lawrence Malagon, was found “trying to pry open the door to a storage locker” located in a carport on the 6600 block of Abrego Road, said Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Malagon used a knife –– gripped between a pair of pliers –– along with a screwdriver jammed into the door in his attempt to open the carport door.</p>\n<p>Police also reported finding other burglary tools in the vicinity, some of which included “a drill, hammer, fork, knife, and shim,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Malagon reportedly told police he wanted to pick up some of the items that he stored there and that he himself didn’t live in the area.</p>\n<p>SBSO contacted the property manager and some of the property’s tenants, all of who said that Malagon had no legal right to open the storage unit.</p>\n<p>Malagon was booked in Santa Barbara County Jail on a $20,000 bail.
