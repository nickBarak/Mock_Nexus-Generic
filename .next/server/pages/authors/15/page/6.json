Legal Code for her position as an on-campus senator.</p>\n<p>“[By] not living On-Campus Yasamin Salari is unable to serve and adequately represent her constituents,” she said in the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Yasamin-Salari-Petition-Redacted.pdf\">petition</a>, which was filed on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Mukai could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Mukai references Article III, Section 1 Eligibility, Subsection B4 of Legal Code, which states that “Senate Representatives must live among their constituents during Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters of their year of elective service.”</p>\n<p>Senate granted Salari a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/on-campus-senator-yasamin-salari-admits-to-living-off-campus-in-violation-of-legal-code/\">one-time exception</a> at its Nov. 14 meeting during Fall Quarter 2018 after she spoke about her housing situation. During that meeting, she explained that she had originally planned to live on campus, but was unable to do so due to financial issues.</p>\n<p>Salari said in an email to the <i>Nexus </i>that she was “still waiting on more information about this whole situation” and would be able to discuss it further after midterms were over.</p>\n<p>According to a notice posted in A.S. Main by Judicial Council Chair Raymond Alonso, the council will be holding a hearing for the case on Feb. 20 at 6:30 p.m. in the Lobero Room in the University Center.</p>\n<p>At the Wednesday night Senate meeting, College of Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno introduced a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Policy-36.pdf\">bill</a> to create Standing Policy 36, which would address the issue of senators not living amongst their constituents, Salari in particular.</p>\n<p>The Senate tabled the bill for a week.</p>\n<p>The policy establishes rules for senators who change living arrangements or colleges while serving in their positions. Previously, senators with living arrangement issues were given one-time exceptions without an ensuing Legal Code change, the bill explains.</p>\n<p>The bill writes that senators who are no longer able to live among their constituents for external circumstances — which “may include but is not limited to Financial Insecurity, Physical and Mental Health, and experiencing Racism, Queerphobia, Transphobia” — will be given the opportunity to explain the situation before the Senate votes on whether to grant them a one-time exception.</p>\n<p>If they are not granted a one-time exception, they will be removed from the Senate.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simren Verma contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>Updated 10:46 p.m.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

President during the 2000-2001 school year, created the project as an A.S. staff member in 2012.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times, students involved in various organizations don’t necessarily know the history of their group with which they are involved. Seeing that need, I started to develop the idea of the Living History Project,” he <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/a-s-senate-discusses-library/\">said</a> at a Senate meeting that year.</p>\n<p>This quarter, second-years Frances Woo and Christine Hoang are working to resurrect the project and flesh it out into a collaborative student organization.</p>\n<p>The two were hired by Living History Project Advisor Leah Bartos last spring and have been working behind the scenes since then to prepare for their first general meeting, which took place this past Monday.</p>\n<p>They decided to start the project from scratch, realizing that a lot of the information on the former website lacked proper summarization and sources.</p>\n<p>“It was just a lot of information, and it could very well be true, but it wasn’t cited, so we’re trying to work on that,” Hoang said.</p>\n<p>Instead, Woo and Hoang have been delving into the Department of Special Research Collections at UCSB and conducting their own interviews to put together articles for the website.</p>\n<p>In addition to the new website, the two have been working on growing the project to make it accessible to any students interested in joining. They have also been setting up social media accounts and inviting students to attend general meetings.</p>\n<p>“Our goal for the end of this quarter is we’re gonna have the people who continue with us during the general meetings to learn how to research and dive into special collections,” Woo said.</p>\n<p>“They’re all gonna have an article hopefully produced at the end of the quarter and then we’re gonna have a little launch party for the website.”</p>\n<p>They hope to generate more content for the website by the end of the quarter as well, mentioning that it can take a while to sort through various sources of information and find people to interview.</p>\n<p>“We are working on talking to members of the community, or people who used to be a part of the UCSB community and just getting their side of the story,” Hoang added. “We’re really trying to find the miniscule details that people don’t necessarily know about.”</p>\n<p>Woo said that they hope that they can eventually become a reliable source of information for students interested in learning more about the history of activism on campus.</p>\n<p>One of the first articles published on the new website was about one of the most famous events in Isla Vista history: the burning of the Bank of America building.</p>\n<p>“When we go into special collections, there’s a lot of like weird information from old newspapers… It’s just insane to see all the events that have happened in I.V. history,” Woo said.</p>\n<p>“I know in general about some of them but reading firsthand accounts, like the Bank of America burning, which I did an article on, I researched a lot of what happened and — can I swear? — that shit was fucking insane!”</p>\n<p>Woo said she started with the bank burning because it was a topic she knew there would be a lot of information on, but students who join the Living History Project would have discretion in choosing what to cover.</p>\n<p>“The whole of student activism at UCSB is so big,” she added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85923\" style=\"width: 1940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/living-history-project-revived-by-dedicated-second-years/screen-shot-2019-01-31-at-12-21-30-am/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-85923\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85923\" data-attachment-id=\"85923\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/living-history-project-revived-by-dedicated-second-years/screen-shot-2019-01-31-at-12-21-30-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?fit=1930%2C1290&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1930,1290\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-01-31 at 12.21.30 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85923\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?resize=888%2C594\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"594\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?w=1930&amp;ssl=1 1930w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-12.21.30-AM.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85923\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Woo and Hoang have created several templates for student collaborators interested in doing this research. The first is a boards, commissions and units (BCU) and student organization bio, which would detail the origins of a student organization on campus and the social climate in which it developed.</p>\n<p>The second gathers personal testimonials about notable points of I.V. history, like the Bank of America burning, and the third creates timelines of topics like women’s organizing throughout UCSB history.</p>\n<p>“We’re making it so open because we want people to pursue a topic that they’re passionate about, so that way they can learn more about it and be passionate about when they’re writing, and that’ll show through their work too,” Woo said.</p>\n<p>As they begin to work with other students, they hope to expand the kind of work that they present on the website and help students pursue what they’re interested in.</p>\n<p>“Research can take form and be represented in a number of ways. You can write articles or take interviews with people, collect photo and newspaper artifacts and even create informational videos on the research that you find, so we really want to make sure that our members have the options to do research but also conduct it however they please,” Hoang said.</p>\n<p>Bartos, who has been advising the two throughout the process, said the shift from a single A.S. staff member updating the website behind the scenes to a student organization working on it is the biggest change that has happened since the project was restarted.</p>\n<p>“This is becoming a much more collaborative effort with the campus,” she said.</p>\n<p>The new nature of the project now leaves more room for crowdsourcing efforts, she added.</p>\n<p>“In the future, if they get some historical photo of like a protest in the ’70s, they can reach out to the community and say like ‘Hey, what else can you tell us about this image?’” she said.</p>\n<p>The collaborative aspect of the project is what makes it special to both Woo and Hoang.</p>\n<p>“We’re just starting up, and we hope that with other people’s contributions that we can become bigger and an important part of UCSB’s campus and community because student activism is super important,” Hoang said.</p>\n<p>“I think that not enough students are aware about all the things that’s happened in the past, and it’s still happening right now. Student activism happens every day and history is living, it’s constant, so we hope that we can get more information out there to students at UCSB.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Jan. 31, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at skamidi@dailynexus.com or news@daliynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Legal Code, and wants to encourage them to reach out to the council if they have any concerns about legal code violations.</p>\n<p>“Almost every body of Associated Students violates legal code, accidentally, or on purpose, but usually accidentally. We want to make ourselves known to other people, like hey, if something is happening in your BCU which violates legal code and you don’t like this, we have legal code for a reason, and that’s something that you can come to us about,” he added.</p>\n<p>By gaining a better understanding of A.S. Legal Code, organizations can operate in the most efficient manner, Alonso said, which is his ultimate goal with the Council.</p>\n<p>“I’ve gone to a few BCU meetings myself, the bodies are great, and they have these brilliant missions, but because they aren’t super informed on legal code, they get stuck in a lot of… bureaucratic red tape,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It just really paralyzes action, and I want people to have the best understanding of legal code because it was designed very specifically to allow A.S. to function, not to prevent it from functioning.”</p>\n<p>Speaking to the Senate Wednesday evening, Alonso fielded questions about how he would address conflicts of interest and potential biases that could crop up.</p>\n<p>In response, Alonso affirmed that he was committed to transparency, both amongst council members and from himself. Alonso also noted that last spring, when the council encountered a case where he had a conflict of interest, he immediately recused himself from the discussion.</p>\n<p>Alonso also said the council has been discussing possible bias trainings that they could undergo in order to make the judicial proceedings as fair and understanding as they can be.</p>\n<p>Internally, Alonso plans on revamping the Council’s office space in order for them to be able to hear cases in their office, instead of spending the bulk of their minimal budget on renting out spaces to hear cases.</p>\n<p>He also plans to make the process of submitting a petition more clear by creating a Google form with mandatory questions, noting that petitions that were submitted last spring were bogged down with technicalities and are now being dealt with over six months later.</p>\n<p>Making the office as efficient as it can be is Alonso’s goal for his time as chair, but it’s also important to him to introduce an aspect of warmth to the proceedings.</p>\n<p>“It is important that all people within UCSB are able to feel safe and comfortable and know that the Association has their back.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at skamidi@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

It also directs UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) to raise its workers’ pay to $15 an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 322 students employed by A.S., and 33 career employees, according to Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mello and Ornelas noted in the resolution that the UC had implemented a policy in 2013 that raised the minimum wage for UC employees to $15 in 2013, but that it only applied to those who worked at least 20 hours a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“…at many UC campuses, students are prohibited from working more than 19 hours per week, thereby systematically preventing them from qualifying for a raise under this policy,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution demands that the $15 minimum wage be applied to all UC workers, regardless of the number of hours that they work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with supporting a systemwide cost-of-living raise, the resolution also directs A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez to work with Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez and President Brooke Kopel to increase wages for students employed by A.S. UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution mandates that yearly A.S. budgets from now onward should account for the increased wages and directs the UC Human Resources department to “perform an upward reclassification” of UCSB employees to ensure that their minimum salary meets the living minimum wage policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Human Resources department declines to do so or does not respond to the resolution within two weeks, the Senate will provide honoraria for A.S. UCSB employees to ensure their final pay amounts to at least $15 an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate also plans to pass a resolution stating that “ASUCSB has no confidence with University of California’s ability to fairly treat ASUCSB employees” if Human Resources does not accommodate the requests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators discussed where the funding would come from during Wednesday evening’s meeting, clarifying that student fees would not be raised in order to increase A.S. UCSB wages. Instead, funds within the current budget would be reallocated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though several senators argued that it would be unfair to prioritize A.S. UCSB workers with this raise when many students have other on-campus jobs or work in I.V., Ornelas referred to this motion as a “stepping stone” with the hope of setting the tone for other organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of waiting for [the university] to do something… we should start and let them follow us with everything that we do,” On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon was the only one to abstain from the vote, stating they strongly supported the resolution but could not vote due to a conflict of interest because they worked at the A.S. Ticket Office.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ornelas clarified that there are 322 student employees working for Associated Students. The article previously said there were 282. </em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor at the </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and can be reached at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skamidi@dailynexus.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">news@dailynexus.com</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>.</em> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Ornelas is the chair and will only vote in tie-breaking instances.</p>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) Executive Director Marisela Marquez and representatives from the office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the Environmental Affairs Board will serve as non-voting ex-officio members.</p>\n<p><b>“</b>Every year that I’ve lived in I.V., my house has had mold in the bathroom,” Ornelas said at the meeting Wednesday evening. “That really comes down to lack of proper ventilation, and then when you have multiple people using these same facilities, it’s just always going to be like wet and damp in there paired with just the climate that we have here.”</p>\n<p>“It just creates the perfect conditions for mold to grow in new spaces and it’s really toxic and can be damaging to health.”</p>\n<p>The committee is tasked with developing a survey to distribute in I.V., publishing the survey results and bringing back its recommendations for how to address the mold problem to the Senate.</p>\n<p>The resolution notes that there are over 9,500 UC Santa Barbara students living in I.V., many of whom have expressed concerns about mold in their homes, particularly with the number of students living in each residence.</p>\n<p>“…students living in Isla Vista often have multiple housemates and roommates requiring them to all use common facilities,” the resolution writes.</p>\n<p>“having multiple people share these facilities throughout the day, without proper ventilation can create a warm, damp, and humid environment which perpetuates mold growth.”</p>\n<p>Ornelas also said at the meeting Wednesday evening that he spoke with A.S. Legal Resource Center Attorney Ron Perry over the summer about how students could address mold. He learned that laws about mold were vague because of the range of molds that exist and their varying levels of harm to residents.</p>\n<p>The resolution also notes that “some Isla Vista landlords have begun adding mold clauses to their leases which relinquish responsibility for dealing with mold entirely up to tenants.”</p>\n<p>The committee plans to report back to Senate on a weekly basis and by the end of Winter Quarter, make a decision on the future on the committee.</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.4 of the Jan. 10 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at skamidi@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

posted on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IslaVistaParty/photos/a.1334704666576146/2080887568624515/?type=3&amp;theater\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/islavistaparty/status/1079173142680002565\">Twitter</a>, the party announced that the two members – Associated Students (A.S.) Internal Vice President Steven Ho and External Vice President for Statewide Affairs-elect (EVPSA) Mayela Morales – were removed due to Title IX-related violations and “unprofessionalism that has come to light,” according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The two were removed from the party during summer 2018, the statement said. This is the first time the Isla Vista Party publicly announced the decision.</p>\n<p>According to Ho, he was first informed of his removal by the social media posts.</p>\n<p>“I was unaware of my removal until the statement released by leadership of the party,” he said.</p>\n<p>When Ho reached out to party leadership to discuss the matter, he was told “that someone was supposed to talk to me and poor communication within the party resulted in that not happening.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Party did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>Morales declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Morales was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> from the EVPSA position after it was discovered she was not enrolled at UC Santa Barbara during Spring Quarter 2018. She currently serves as the Parliamentarian for the A.S. Senate and as the Chief of Staff for the Office of the Student Advocate.</p>\n<p>In the statement, the Isla Vista Party (IVP) apologized for not previously announcing the removal of the two members and “for contributing to community members feeling unsafe in student government spaces due to this.”</p>\n<p>This is the second instance of separation between parties and high-profile members to occur during winter break.

CSD motioned at its Sept. 25 meeting to ask that Bird not operate in I.V. until a county ordinance was developed. </span><em>Sicheng Weng / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman, who spoke at the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting Tuesday evening, said Bird had picked up 80 of its scooters and paid the $24 impound fee per scooter about two weeks ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The impound fee is] a standard fee that a student would pay or anyone would pay,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Police Department (UCPD) did not begin stringently impounding scooters until Dec. 3, Bowman said. While the university was putting together its interim policy, there was a warning period for scooters being ridden or found on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD began impounding scooters on a complaint basis for approximately a month after the warning period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[One] was parked in a handicapped zone. So somebody called that into the university police department and we went and picked it up to make that space available,” he said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Then, as the number of reported serious injuries result[ing] from local scooters [increased], coupled with national media coverage of how scooters were impacting communities across the nation, we stepped up our enforcement and started impounding more scooters on campus property.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several students have been fined for riding scooters on campus, which could cost them as much as $200, as per California legal code. UC Santa Barbara reminded students of the potential fine in an email sent out Dec. 10. The university also put up several posters around campus, particularly in the residence halls, as another reminder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one instance, Bowman said, a student was offered the opportunity to either pay a reduced fine of $175 or complete community service. The student chose the latter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman also said several students have been injured riding scooters on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One was a significant gash to the forehead, that I’m sure required many stitches,” he said.  “The second was, from the pictures I could tell it was road rash, but the student was in a [cervical collar], or there was obvious concern of spinal injury.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman has only seen photos of two incidents, but confirmed that there have been several other scooter-related accidents on campus as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goleta City Council implemented a ban on electric scooters in Goleta on Dec. 4, noting that Bird and Lime have a history of bringing their scooters to communities without the approval of local governments, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noozhawk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/goleta_council_votes_unanimously_to_ban_motorized_scooters\"> reported</a>.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD motioned at its Sept. 25 <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fcyR-G8PfwPhaEIq9rOcygNMjCZJ12_bca06Sq9Hn4k/edit#\">meeting</a> to ask that Bird not operate in I.V. until a county ordinance was developed.

If you work hard from a young age and get good grades and test scores, you’ll get into a Good College, and if you work hard and get good grades in college, you’ll land a good job right out of college. That good job will set you up for financial success, and you’ll live comfortably.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85379\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85379\" data-attachment-id=\"85379\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-12/pursue-your-passions-or-please-your-parents/sanya-article-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?fit=650%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?fit=650%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85379\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?resize=650%2C650\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"650\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85379\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand where they’re coming from. It’s the way they were told they would find success. It’s what my parents did. They studied hard, went to a good college and, when they had the opportunity, they moved to the United States to make a better life for themselves. And when they were able to support themselves and my brother and me, they started sending money back to India to support their family back home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve been lucky enough to be able to visit India frequently, and over the years, I’ve seen how my parents have been able to give back to their parents and siblings there. On my dad’s side of the family, his mother, sister, brother-in-law and three nephews and nieces were able to move out of a one-bedroom apartment with his help. Two of my cousins have now moved to the U.S. to get their master’s degree, with his help. My mom was able to help her sister build her own hospital in Hyderabad and help her brother-in-law run for office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I frequently joke about how Indian people only view three careers as options for their children: doctor, lawyer and engineer. But it really was the case. I fought hard and got into truly nasty arguments with my parents growing up about what career path I would pursue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always been a writer at heart. I knew that. So when it came time to apply to colleges, every day in my home was a battlefield. Eventually, my parents and I settled on a compromise: I would go into marketing, the one field my parents thought was financially viable and that I thought I could do work that I was good at and enjoyed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I decided on UCSB as my school, my parents were skeptical of communication as my major but figured it was the closest thing the school had to business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then I fell in love with journalism. I had already taken a few years of it in high school (another source of strain between my parents and me), but it was at the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where I knew there wasn’t anything else I wanted to do with my life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’LL BE WRITING DAMN ARTICLES ON MY DEATHBED,” I wrote in an overzealous finsta post over the summer.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Didn’t my mom understand how hard it was to navigate a system that no one gave me a guide for?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know I have a long road ahead of me when it comes to my parents. A few months ago, my parents told me to cut back on my time at the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because it was just a “hobby.” I didn’t know how to tell them how it was so much more to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we’re getting there, though. The other day, I talked to my mom about the internships I had applied to and about a journalism class I was thinking about taking. And for the first time in my life, my mom talked to me about it like journalism was an option. For the first time in my life, my mom was accepting me as I was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be people who read this and won’t understand why it matters so much what my parents say. But despite how hard I’ve railed against a lot of the things my parents believe in, there’s a part of me that still wants to please them. I want my parents to be proud of me. I want to show them that I can both pursue the career I love and support myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And above all that, there’s the prevailing aspiration familiar to any child of an immigrant: I want to make their sacrifices worthwhile. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are days when I get so angry at my parents for not understanding me and at the world for throwing me all the curveballs it can think of. And then there are days when I Whatsapp message my parents about something I’ve accomplished, and they’ll respond with a thumbs-up or “nice” (the only two ways they know how to give praise), and it means everything to me.</span></p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi wants people to find a balance between their parents’ aspirations and their own. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The UCen Governance Board will hear presentations from various businesses and ultimately vote on which one to rent to.</p>\n<p>The board will put together a Request for Proposal (RFP), in which they will “choose a specific type of business that [they] want to go after” or leave options more open-ended, Lawrence said.</p>\n<p>The space is unusual in that it does not have a kitchen and instead has a classroom. Before Kaplan occupied it, the space was filled by various travel agencies.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very weird space,” Rose Ettleson, undergraduate representative on the board, said. “I can’t even think off the top of my head who to occupy that space.”</p>\n<p>Ettleson, a fourth-year environmental studies and film and media studies double major, expressed concerns about the possibility of UCPD filling the space.</p>\n<p>“As undergraduate students on this campus, police presence is something that is not always welcomed,” she said, noting that the UCPD inquiry was still in the “very beginning stages.”</p>\n<p>“Obviously I don’t want there to be just one option unless it really seems like a good option.”</p>\n<p>UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson said in an email that if they were to secure the space, it would primarily be used for “community policing and [a] Community Service Officer (CSO) station.”</p>\n<p>Currently, UCPD’s station is a 20-minute walk from the center of campus.</p>\n<p>“This space could enable the UC Police Department and its members to more effectively and routinely interact with the campus community in non-enforcement contacts.”</p>\n<p>Olson said the appeal of the space is its central location on campus and its proximity to other campus organizations and entities.</p>\n<p>While UCPD has not submitted a formal proposal, Olson listed the task as a priority for 2019, along with identifying a source of funding if UCPD is chosen.</p>\n<p>The space does not have a fixed rent, Lawrence said, although Kaplan paid approximately $8.50 per square foot.</p>\n<p>For now, the campus bookstore will use the space at the beginning of Winter Quarter for the book reservation program that they typically hold in the lobby.</p>\n<p>Lawrence hopes the board can find an entity to fill the space as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“We just would like to find somebody who’s willing to pay the most rent possible,” he joked.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Along with Nguyen, she is part of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen what the school is, especially what the students kind of want, as well,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked closely with the student body… I’ve been on the student faculty committee for about two years now and work in the Office of Judicial Affairs, so I see the administrative side and the student side, as well.”</p>\n<p>Nilsen, a third-year computer science major, previously worked as a solicitor general for the A.S. attorney general’s office.

So she continued her drive home, driving through Paradise. That’s when she saw a man on the side of the road, putting out a fire Tamara said was creeping closer.</p>\n<p>“As soon as I went into my driveway and pulled up, I heard an explosion,” Tamara said. Mikala speculated it was a propane tank, or possibly a transformer.</p>\n<p>Tamara and her son, Nick, packed enough clothes to last them a week, which took “longer than it should’ve,” Tamara said.</p>\n<p>Halfway to Paradise, Tamara’s car got turned around.</p>\n<p>“When I got down part way up the bridge, everybody’s screaming at me saying ‘Turn around! Turn around!’” she added. “This is all going on like crazy, like everybody’s screaming … cars are hitting each other.”</p>\n<p>With no word from officials on what was happening, residents of Paradise and Magalia were left to their own devices.</p>\n<p>“Everybody didn’t know what to do. There was no police, there was nobody telling us what to do, nobody received a call to say to get out. It was complete chaos,” Tamara said. “Everyone was like ‘What the hell is happening? How could they do this to us? What do we do? Are we going to burn?’”</p>\n<p>Tamara was rerouted to the long road out of Magalia toward Chico, which took her approximately three and a half hours.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85122\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1289994422\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85119\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85122\" data-attachment-id=\"85122\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/camp-fire-leaves-ucsb-students-hometown-destroyed/online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1143&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1143\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=888%2C507&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-85122\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3-1024x585.jpg?resize=888%2C507\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C585&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85122\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Butson family</em></p></div>\n<p>For those three and a half hours, Mikala heard nothing.</p>\n<p>“The route that they took up through the mountains has no reception,” she said. “The last time I had gotten a text was ‘We’re evacuating, do you want me to grab you anything?’ and then I didn’t hear from them for like four hours.”</p>\n<p>With both misinformation and a general lack of information coursing through social media during the early hours, Mikala was left to wonder if her family had been lost to the flames.</p>\n<p>“I wish I was there to help my mom, get stuff out of the house and help her evacuate and be there for them,” she said. “But I was all the way here. I felt kind of hopeless.”</p>\n<p>Residents driving out of Paradise and Magalia on the main road, the Skyway, found themselves <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/10/this-is-when-i-die-unforgettable-tales-of-escape-from-the-camp-fire/?utm_content=tw-mercnews&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social\">trapped </a>as the flames licked their cars, killing a number of residents.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Magalia altered the roads in its downtown to be more reminiscent of an old town, like Truckee, Calif., Tamara said.</p>\n<p>But that meant converting two of the four lanes into parking — two lanes that were unavailable for residents as they attempted to evacuate.</p>\n<p>“Everybody was kind of freaking out, going ‘How did this happen? How did we get all these billions of dollars to change this road?’” Tamara said. “‘We need the access, because if there’s a fire, where are we going to go?’”</p>\n<p>“And so, sure enough, a fire happened and everybody was like ‘Why did they do this? It’s like they meant to kill us or something.’”</p>\n<p>The lack of official communication, coupled with the minimal evacuation routes, meant many residents died in their homes.</p>\n<p>“We’re on an emergency system. They’ve been preparing us for a couple years. Like, ‘If there’s an emergency, we’re gonna call everybody reverse 911,” Tamara said. “We all felt pretty comfortable, like they’re going to call us for any emergency. Nobody knew anything, and it was early in the morning, you know, people were still sleeping. And that’s how come a lot of people died in their homes and in their cars. It was horrifying. It was horrible.”</p>\n<p>“We felt so forgotten, so alone.”</p>\n<p>The Butsons’ house is still standing after the fire.</p>\n<p>“Our house is pretty smoke damaged inside,” Tamara said. “We have soil outside that’s toxic, and the insurance is going to give us no money. They’re only going to bring in cleaners and have them clean.”</p>\n<p>If Tamara feels that the cleaning job is not satisfactory and there are still leftover toxins, she then has to pay for tests to measure the toxicity, which cost anywhere between $1,000 and $5,000, according to Tamara.</p>\n<p>“I can’t go back to my house; there’s no way I can live in toxicity,” Tamara said. “My house should’ve burned down because if it would’ve burned down, I at least could’ve had money to then take it and then pay off the bank and then start again.”</p>\n<p>“But it didn’t, so I’m one of the unlucky ones.”</p>\n<p>Tamara, Mikala and Nick moved to Paradise when Mikala was three years old, and eventually moved to Magalia, the neighboring town.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I’m 54. I have no idea … I just can’t make enough money starting over. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“It’s difficult to say I enjoyed growing up there,” Mikala said. “My mom had only just been able to get a job that was higher-paying. None of the people around me had a lot.”</p>\n<p>Butte County is one of the poorest counties in California, Tamara added.</p>\n<p>“People literally … the seniors, the disabled, the single moms, they absolutely have no money. I’m fortunate. I feel fortunate. I came with nothing, but I feel fortunate,” Tamara said.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 17, President Trump visited Butte County alongside Governor Jerry Brown and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>\n<p>“When he was giving his speech, [Trump] couldn’t even remember the name of Paradise. He called it ‘Pleasure,’” Mikala said. “His response has not been supportive.”</p>\n<p>“He has basically said it was our fault … that we should’ve raked our leaves, we should’ve done these small things,” she added. “He’s denying any bigger issue of climate change or any bigger issue of PG&amp;E being the cause of it.”</p>\n<p>Mikala spoke about the political attitudes of Butte County and Paradise more specifically. Although the area is mostly conservative, many Trump supporters questioned Trump’s response to the Camp Fire, according to Mikala.</p>\n<p>However, she doesn’t believe political opinions have substantially changed after the fire.</p>\n<p>“It’s very red, and, basically, the opinions reflect that.”</p>\n<p>There is one common sentiment on the ground: <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/09/pge-power-lines-may-have-sparked-deadly-butte-county-wildfire-according-to-radio-transmissions/\">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E)</a> is to blame, Mikala said.</p>\n<p>Months ago, Mikala and her family got a notice in the mail from PG&amp;E which indicated that when there is high fire danger, PG&amp;E would shut off the power.</p>\n<p>A couple of days before the fire, PG&amp;E reported that there would be high winds and therefore the power would be shut off, Mikala said.</p>\n<p>“They had never shut off the power, even though they told us they were going to,” she said. Then, the fire happened.</p>\n<p>“There are already people who are starting the lawsuits against them and like getting legal teams together,” Mikala added. “I’ve seen hundreds of people talk about it online. If they find out that’s what caused it, it’s going to be a huge thing.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-paradise-fire-lawsuit-1542165733-htmlstory.html\"><i>The Los Angeles Times</i> reported</a> that people who lost homes in the Camp Fire have, in fact, already begun suing PG&amp;E.</p>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, PG&amp;E “did not maintain its infrastructure and failed to properly inspect and manage its power transmission lines,” the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reported.</p>\n<p>In the days since Tamara and Nick left Magalia, they traveled to Santa Barbara to stay with Mikala in her one-bedroom apartment, which is “paid for entirely by financial aid and loans from the school,” Mikala wrote on the family’s <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/butson-family-camp-fire-fund?fbclid=IwAR0Lkse9VxkxeRzEuh4HMqnqfMJqLXW9R9ffpXboxChCWDuZqxBiK18nmQM\">GoFundMe</a> page.</p>\n<p>After staying with Mikala for about a week and a half, the two found an apartment in Solvang, which they were able to furnish with two beds and a few household items with money from the GoFundMe.</p>\n<p>Mikala signed them up for Adopt a Family, a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/paradisefireadoptafamily/?ref=group_header\">Facebook group</a> to connect those affected by the Camp Fire and those who want to help. The person who has ‘adopted’ Tamara’s family has been sending them items every day from their Amazon Wish List, including a coloring book to help Tamara de-stress.</p>\n<p>But what comes next?</p>\n<p>“Wow,” Tamara exhaled.</p>\n<p>A heavy pause followed.</p>\n<p>“You know, I’m freaking out right now. I loved my job. I finally had a job that I was doing so well financially, and I had it planned out. I was paying off things, I was going to save. I had enough for taxes. I was feeling good about it,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I’m 54. I have no idea … I just can’t make enough money starting over. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>For now, Tamara sees herself putting down roots in Solvang, close to her daughter.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a really hard time having my family apart,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mikala, who will be graduating this spring, is looking to get a full-time position at the UCSB Library, where she currently works part-time.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to go to graduate school, but I was going to take the year off. But now, maybe I should just go on for financial purposes instead of taking the year,” she said.</p>\n<p>The family doesn’t see a future for them in their hometown.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [Paradise and Magalia] are going to rebuild, and if [they do], it’s going to be many, many, many years because it’s just so devastated,” Mikala said.</p>\n<p>Tamara and her son will be in Solvang for at least the next year.</p>\n<p>“[Nick] was here awhile back and loved Solvang, and he told me many many months ago that if there’s anywhere he wanted to live, it would be Solvang,” she said. “So, I said, ‘That’s where we’re going to live,’ and here we are.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Even though they are not officers, they give an appearance of an official person, official authority,” said Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“[With t-shirts] they feel more approachable by people who, one, are probably intoxicated, two, might be from marginalized communities who don’t feel comfortable around police personnel.”</p>\n<p>By the end of the night, SASA representatives set up several verbal agreements with the university to increase students’ access to information about interpersonal violence prevention.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
