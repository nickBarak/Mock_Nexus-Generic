As of now, Kopel says the new members of the council, once appointed, and Alonso will decide on a chair amongst themselves and then present their recommendation to Kopel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Kopel agrees, she will send their recommendation to the Senate.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Nov. 15 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association released a list of demands to the University of California regarding </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath on Wednesday, calling for the system to provide restitution for students who have not been paid and for halting rollout of the system until problems have been addressed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara began transitioning to UCPath at the beginning of this quarter, hoping to create a more streamlined approach to paying its workers, according to the UCPath website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association (UCSA), an organization dedicated to advocating “on behalf of current and future students for the accessibility, affordability, and quality” of the UC system, said UC “has not been paying its student workers” since the implementation of UCPath earlier this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Checks that are received often are for the wrong amount,” the UCSA letter read. “With the number of students who rely on being paid on time to pay rent, buy groceries, or pay student fees to enroll in their classes this is unacceptable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A copy of the UCSA demands to UC are listed below:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Immediately correct the payroll system to ensure that workers will get paid correctly and on time, particularly for those with multiple jobs and those relying on fee remission;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Acknowledge the grievances that the UC Student-Workers Union (UAW) filed on behalf of ASEs at UCR, UCSB, UCLA, and UC Merced;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Provide reparations to all students affected whether or not they are represented by a Union;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Expand financial crisis services specifically for all students affected;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Meet with student leaders and UC Student-Workers Union (UAW) representatives to discuss how to best support students affected by these problems; and</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Immediately halt to the implementation of phases 1 and 2 of the UCPath rollout until the problems stated in this letter are addressed.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Doan, director of media relations within the UC Office of the President (UCOP), said 99 percent of UC employees have been paid “accurately and on time with UCPath.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each each campus transition to this new system, we plan for unforeseen issues by maintaining extra support staff to stay on following implementation,” Doan said in an email. “The additional staff and resources at UC Santa Barbara will be there at least through the end of the year to help address problems.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doan said UCOP has a team in place dedicated to helping students and looking at potentially </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“reimbursing students for interest or late fees due to UCPath complications.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We understand students’ concerns and frustrations, and we are sorry about the problems associated with any instances of delayed processing of salaries and benefits due to the UCPath transition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cierra Sorin, UCSB’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) President, said that while UC Santa </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barbara administrators have been working with the GSA to combat the issues stemming from defaulted payments, many of the issues must be resolved at the UCPath hub located at UC Riverside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The problem is that UCPath was designed to decentralize a lot of things, and so a lot of the struggle has been, and I think continues to be, things that our payroll folks and our department officers used to be able to do, they no longer can,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, students affected by the defaulted payments can apply for emergency loans, although Sorin believes the program should be more widely publicized in light of the payment issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said that university housing had been flexible with rent payments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin herself had not been paid in October, and as a result was not able to pay for her university </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">housing until the end of the month. She said, however, that she had not incurred any late fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What has been happening with housing is people have been encouraged if there is an issue with them being able to pay rent to send an email to housing,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how widely this has been advertised and it’s something I will be speaking with admin about, because I had been hoping an email would be sent out to all folks who live in housing and are potentially experiencing problems, and I haven’t seen one.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin lauded the UCSA demands for presenting a unified front to the UC on behalf of all UC students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I see this as is the UC community…[of] graduate students and undergraduate students coming together and telling the University of California that it is unacceptable that there continue to be this many problems with people being paid accurately and on time,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSA letter writes that UC Riverside and UC Merced experienced problems with UCPath when it was first implemented at those campuses in January 2018, without any structural fixes from the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These issues continued to occur months after the initial rollout, leading student leaders from UC Riverside to reach out to the Office of the President and the UC Regents last Spring. However, there have been inconsistent improvements since they first came forward and these problems have continued to persist when UCPath expanded to other UCs,” the letter read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB GSA sent out a survey to graduate students to collect responses about issues they’ve run into after hearing from the UC Riverside GSA about their problems with UCPath, Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We heard about a lot of the problems [UC Riverside has] had on their campus, and how they’ve </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">snowballed month to month, and so we wanted to see if we were starting to experience those same problems here at UCSB,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beside the typical problems like being unable to pay rent or purchase food, the issues with UCPath have left students unable to pay for classes or receive parking and transportation benefits, Head UAW 2865 Steward Avi McClelland-Cohen previously told the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW 2865 is the union that represents UC student workers, but primarily graduate students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to being low on funds due to defaulted payments, students then have to pay more money out of pocket to make up for the lack of benefits, particularly with transportation, added Sorin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin believes the root cause of the lack of structural reform is because the UC was unaware of the issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even here at Santa Barbara, [the GSA executive board] had a meeting with [Anne and Michael </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towbes Graduate] Dean [Carol] Genetti, earlier in the quarter,” Sorin said. “They had told us they were unaware of anything except fee remission issues up to this point because no one had shared information with us about what was happening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the UCSA has presented these demands to the UC Regents and UCOP, Sorin hopes more immediate and effective change is implemented.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I hope] that President Napolitano and the UC Regents take this seriously, and invest time and energy into fixing these problems immediately such that our December paychecks are delivered on time,” she said. “I’m not optimistic though.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Nov. 15  print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

said the proposed redefinition, which defines gender as the sex assigned at birth, would cause complications.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Trump administration’s proposed redefinition of gender would leave transgender students at UC Santa Barbara stuck in limbo between federal and state guidelines, according to Craig Leets, Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity director.</p>\n<p>Leets said the proposed redefinition, which defines gender as the sex assigned at birth, would cause complications particularly with passports, social security cards and insurance benefits.</p>\n<p>He has been working to advocate for LGBTQ students in higher education since 2012.</p>\n<p>“It’s really complicated for a trans person to get their gender marker with the federal government,” he said. “If [the redefinition] were to go through, there would be no chance at all for a trans person to change that gender marker that is on record with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>Transgender students travelling internationally run the risk of being held up in airports, both domestically and internationally.</p>\n<p>“Their appearance might align with one gender and [if] their gender marker on their passport says something different, that can cause problems for people who are going through customs,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies that operate across state lines would also be able to deny transgender students’ benefits, particularly to cover mental health or transitioning expenses, despite California’s more progressive laws.</p>\n<p>“Many things are more than just state-specific… which is where federal guidelines come in,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>California Senate Bill 179, which was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in Oct. 2017, would allow California residents three options for their gender on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates: male, female and nonbinary, which is denoted by an ‘x.’</p>\n<p>The law fully goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2019, but the Trump administration’s attempts to redefine gender could override the state law.</p>\n<p>“If the federal government were to change that definition it could really impact all of the progress that has been made,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>On UCSB’s campus, students would not see any effects to the protections they are already afforded by the university and the state of California.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has a nondiscrimination policy, and there are a set of protected classes who are legally protected in the state of California… so someone cannot be discriminated against in accessing housing or employment based on their gender, gender identity or gender expression,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“So our nondiscrimination policy, which aligns with those protected classes here in the state of California, would not be impacted or affected.”</p>\n<p>The Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) is currently working on two efforts to support transgender students on campus: first, by providing a community-building space for trans students on campus and second, by implementing policy changes within the university.</p>\n<p>Currently, the center is working on cataloging the number and location of all-gender restrooms on campus. They are also trying to expand the preferred name option on Gaucho On-Line Data (G.O.L.D.) to include pronouns.</p>\n<p>According to Leets, there are approximately 70 all-gender restrooms on campus, with the majority of those being single-stall restrooms.</p>\n<p>Through the RCSGD’s work to establish a map of all-gender restrooms on campus, it has identified a corridor on Ocean Road by the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education and Robertson Gym where there are several buildings without a single all-gender restroom.</p>\n<p>“If a student is in one of those classes, one of those buildings or they have multiple classes in those buildings, it’s really hard for them to find a restroom space that’s close enough by for them to get between classes or for them to go during a class,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>Ideally, Leets would like to establish several all-gender restrooms in all buildings on campus, but says the more realistic goal is at least one in every building “so a student or faculty or staff-person would not have to leave the building that they’re in to have an accessible restroom option.”</p>\n<p>The RCSGD is currently in the inventory phase of the project. Once it identifies priority spots, like the Ocean Road corridor, it will begin requesting funding and approval to convert existing restrooms to all-gender restrooms.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center is also working with the university to expand the preferred name option already available for students.</p>\n<p>For students who have not or cannot change their legal name, they can currently change their preferred name on G.O.L.D. This change will be reflected in numerous locations including their access card, GauchoSpace, G.O.L.D., advising records, the online campus directory and housing rosters.</p>\n<p>“In many places, students will be able to see their preferred name and not have to interact with their legal name. That system is pretty good; we’re just trying to make sure it’s as good as it needs to be,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>As a partner project, they are also working toward including pronouns in the university system in the same places the preferred name already appears.</p>\n<p>Despite the work they’ve already done, projects like these often take longer than the center hopes them to.</p>\n<p>“I think many people want to do that work [to support trans students] and are excited to do that work … The challenge that comes from any large organization [is], ‘Is the money there?’, ‘What’s the technical complications of making these changes,’” he said.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center works closely with Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Associate Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Maria Herrera-Sobek.</p>\n<p>“Our role on campus is to be the leaders of the advocacy and improvement on campus for trans students,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“[The administration is] supporting the work that we are doing and help[s] us to make movement when we can’t ourselves to try and make campus more welcoming for trans students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-84795\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tri Delta has been a chapter at UCSB for 31 years. <em>Nick Song / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“A great deal of care and consideration went into this difficult decision,” Tri Delta’s national president, Kimberlee Di Fede Sullivan, said in an email sent out to members of the sorority Friday morning.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, it was made by the Executive Board, in concert with Gamma Theta’s chapter volunteers and Executive Office staff, with heavy hearts for all involved.”</p>\n<p>Sullivan cited a decline in membership numbers as the reason for shuttering operations.</p>\n<p>“Despite the hard work and dedication of the chapter and the continual support of volunteers and staff, Gamma Theta has not achieved quota since 2012 and currently remains significantly below total,” Sullivan said.</p>\n<p>According to the email, the suspension will last for a minimum of four years, but the chapter hopes to return “at a time that is mutually beneficial for Tri Delta and the university.”</p>\n<p>New members will be offered the option of becoming a sister but would be an unaffiliated collegiate member – an alumnus of the sorority – after June 14, 2019. New members are also allowed to join another sorority at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Students currently living in the house will continue to have housing for the rest of the academic year. All members will retain their membership privileges for the duration of the academic year if they uphold their financial and membership expectations.</p>\n<p>Tri Delta President Sarah Kinane did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 7, 6:03 p.m.]: This article was updated to include information about Kinane.  </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Attorney General, said in the meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>The External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position was left vacant after the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales last spring.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 25 meeting, Madeline Loudon, the sole candidate for the EVPSA position, argued that the threshold was unlikely to be met.</p>\n<p>Loudon was the runner-up in the Spring 2018 Election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been campaigning on this campus for three years now and I know the feasibility of trying to get students to turnout and I know how apathetic students can be. I believe that we are not going to hit the threshold by the second date for sure,” Loudon said.</p>\n<p>In the meeting minutes, Elections Board Member Andrew Yan noted that the office would still be able to function without the External Vice President For Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p>“There are mechanisms that allow the EVPSA office to continue if that position remains vacant,” Diana Collins Puente, Elections Board advisor, said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate passed a resolution over the summer to allow the duties and funds of the office to be split, stating that a bulk of the position’s duties began over the summer as opposed to Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 24 Senate meeting, Alexandra Gessesse, who has been fulfilling some of the duties of the EVPSA in her position as campaign organizing director, urged the Senate to encourage their constituents to vote.</p>\n<p>“We still haven’t met the threshold, and our office is starting to [get] our nose deep in work regarding requisition forms and things like that,” she said. “We don’t have an EVPSA, and we won’t have one for the entire year, and that’ll be really hard for our office.”</p>\n<p>“Campaign as if you were campaigning for yourself.”</p>\n<p>While Elections Board decided against halving the threshold for the time being, they are putting their efforts toward their “Get Out The Vote” campaign by setting up a voting booth at Pardall Center and a mobile voting booth on campus.</p>\n<p>They also partnered with the A.S. Ticket Office to send an email to students who purchased tickets to the annual Delirium concert put on by A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<p>Loudon did not appear to be actively campaigning by the time Elections Board held their Oct. 11 meeting and was unable to make it to the candidate forum on Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>If the minimum voting threshold is not reached, the EVPSA position will remain vacant until the Spring Quarter 2019 elections.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 3]: This article was updated to include information about the second extension of the deadline. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

history of black Americans as well as more specialized courses detailing Caribbean studies, the black radical tradition and the history of jazz music.</p>\n<p>Professor Jeffrey Stewart, who works in the department and helped organize the North Hall Takeover: 50 Years After conference that took place at UC Santa Barbara earlier this month, is proud of the growth the department has seen since its creation.</p>\n<p>“We feel that our very existence here is due to their vision and their activism, so we try to honor that with these anniversary celebrations,” Stewart said.</p>\n<p>The creation of the Black Studies department also set the groundwork for other departments such as the Chicanx Studies department, the Feminist Studies department and the Asian American Studies department.</p>\n<p>“There’s a body of knowledge that’s come out of the black experience of America that all students can benefit from and there’s a body of knowledge that’s come out of the Chicano experience of America that can be useful for all students,” Stewart said.</p>\n<p>Stewart cites a “critical apparatus” and activism as the two leading tenets of the Black Studies department.</p>\n<p>Not only does the department teach its students to be critical consumers of the information presented to them, but it also emphasizes the need for activism and the role it’s played in creating the America we live in today, he said.</p>\n<p>“Activism sometimes is looked down on in the larger political landscape but I think if you look at change in America, much of it has come about because people have been activists,” he said.</p>\n<p>Despite its growth, the department is currently struggling with a shortage of professors.</p>\n<p>While Stewart said the problem is mostly temporary due to professors who have passed away or recently left, he said the larger problem is the lack of attention to the humanities as a whole.</p>\n<p>“The university is internationally known for its science and engineering, so that’s kind of what they’re always emphasizing,” said Stewart said.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to interdisciplinary departments like black studies, feminist studies… sometimes it’s a struggle to get administrators to see that part of the education here is not just getting technical education, it’s education to become a citizen, and to be a globally aware citizen.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has a long history of activism, particularly within the Black Student Union (BSU).</p>\n<p>BSU students are currently working to update the demands from 2012 and cite their two biggest concerns as the resources available for black educators and the “recruitment and retention of black students,” according to BSU Chair Mariyah Lewis.</p>\n<p>“Seeing how the office engages with the retention and recruitment of black students… is one of the indicative efforts of how strong and how serious the demands are, ranging from 1968 all the way to 2012,” said Alexandra Gessesse, whose position in the Office of Admissions as diversity intern was a direct result of previous BSU demands.</p>\n<p>Dalton Nezey, one of the original members of the North Hall Takeover, echoed similar sentiments in establishing strong, consistent professors in the Black Studies department.</p>\n<p>“I wanted [the professors] to be caretakers of the history of black studies and the history of blacks on this campus,” Nezey said.</p>\n<p>Samantha Sanchez, who is leading the seven-member BSU demands team, says most of the demands have received money allocated toward their completion.</p>\n<p>The team is now responsible for making sure the money is used correctly.</p>\n<p>The demands are constantly evolving, as the needs of black students at UCSB evolve, and Sanchez says the main goal of the demands team is to “assess the state of the black community on campus.”</p>\n<p>“What we have left right now is just to ensure the overall well-being of black students and black people on campus,” she added.</p>\n<p>The addition of two black psychologists in Counseling and Psychological Services and the creation of the diversity intern position in the Admissions Office are two of the demands from 2012 that have already been met.</p>\n<p>There are still many demands left incomplete, however, including one asking for a display in North Hall memorializing the North Hall Takeover and a database of contact information for black students to allow for faculty or BSU leaders to “extend resources to our community more systematically and rigorously,” according to the 2012 demands.</p>\n<p>“I think that the things that we’re implementing will allow for us to see change happen in a very institutional and lasting way,” Sanchez said. “I’m excited to see where it goes after I graduate.”</p>\n<p><i>A

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Daily Nexus archives</em></p></div>\n<p>In response to the demands set forth by the protesters, the Department of Black Studies was established.</p>\n<p>The creation of that department paved the way for additional departments such as the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies, the Department of Feminist Studies and the Department of Asian American Studies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think in retrospect that we fully understood or comprehended the significance and the lifetime gravity that that event represented,” Murad Rahman, chair of the Black Student Union (BSU) in 1968, said.</p>\n<p>“We certainly by no means did we know and fully understand all of it … maybe until years and years after that, in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>Rahman remembers the events of Oct. 14 that year clearly.</p>\n<p>He and the 11 other students shouldered uncertainty, risk and, most of all, unwavering resolve as they took over North Hall.</p>\n<p>At the time, North Hall held the mainframe computer for the entire UC system and was considered “the most critical point” of the campus, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Rahman and other students attended UCSB during a time of tumultuous social and political climate. Significant moments, such as the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy as well as the rise of prominence of Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement, created the backdrop against which students experienced college life.</p>\n<p>Being among the small number of African American students at the time provided a difficult environment to navigate, Cynthia Davis, secretary for BSU in 1968, recalled.</p>\n<p>“There was a[n] identity crisis because we were such a minority there on campus,” Davis said. “Because of that fact, sort of being isolated like that … we tried to find ways where we could group together to support one another.”</p>\n<p>BSU was an important avenue for African American students to support each other and discuss the challenges they faced as students at UCSB and a minority race in the 1960s, according to Davis.</p>\n<p>Students of BSU worked to raise awareness about issues faced by African American students and fight for changes they felt would benefit their community and black communities throughout the nation, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Dalton Nezey, a football player in 1968 and one of North Hall Takeover participants, joined forces with Rahman and other BSU members in discussion about what the school needed to be doing better for its black students.</p>\n<p>Several of those discussions revolved around the mistreatment of black athletes on the football team, which included the lack of financial aid given to black athletes in comparison to their white counterparts, the use of derogatory language by coaching staff and the general lack of respect black students were given.</p>\n<p>“We felt that we were being treated differently, and … in that conversation about football, we started looking at the structure of the campus,” Nezey said.</p>\n<p>These complaints, coupled with “racial insensitivity, [and] racial illiteracy” on campus as well as the national social strife at the time, were the final catalyst for the North Hall Takeover, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>In secret – from the public as well as most members of the BSU at the time – Rahman, Nezey and other students devised a plan to secure the computer center at North Hall and demand changes at UCSB from the chancellor at the time, Vernon Cheadle.</p>\n<p>Students planned the “high-risk operation” two weeks in advance.</p>\n<p>BSU members located all the exits in the building, prepared for attempted infiltration from police and threats of violence. They also determined how they would communicate and negotiate with key players on the outside.</p>\n<p>Even on the morning of the Takeover, some of the protestors, though resolved in their mission, were apprehensive about what the rest of the day would entail.</p>\n<p>“We knew we were doing the right thing … the question was, how fearful were we of the consequences? That was the issue,” Thomas Crenshaw, one of the protestors, said.</p>\n<p>“Were we fearful? Yeah, we were fearful. Were we afraid? Yeah, we were afraid. There were a lot of us who met to go into North Hall. Only 12 of us showed up.”</p>\n<p>The 12 students arrived at North Hall around 6 a.m. on Oct. 14, when they anticipated the halls would be empty of workers and students. The protestors convinced the few technicians who were present to leave after explaining the gravity of the situation about to take place.</p>\n<p>The students had coordinated a team on the outside to facilitate negotiations at the chancellor’s office while the 12 remained barricaded inside North Hall.</p>\n<p>Booker Banks, another member of the 12 inside the building, addressed the crowd gathered outside the building throughout the day.

Grecia Martinez will also be purchasing $600 worth of food and beverages for the workers through the Senate’s unallocated funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate decided to double the original amount requested ($300) after learning that the strike is expecting approximately 500 students per day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also calls upon A.S.

It promises to compensate the A.S. student workers who sign in at the strike and miss their shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. entities that will be affected by the work stoppage include the A.S Bike Shop, A.S.

id=\"caption-attachment-84302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">IVCSD board members also expressed concerns about the safety of Bird scooters in I.V., highlighting the potential for accidents and hazardous misuse of the scooters. <em>Sicheng Weng / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCPD has taken a “hands off” approach to the regulation of scooters on campus so far, despite requests for them to “heavily impound” the scooters, according to Matt Bowman, UCPD Acting Lieutenant, who spoke at Tuesday’s I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The scooters are currently categorized under the title of motor vehicles, according to Bowman, who says a citation for riding a Bird on campus could cost $250.</p>\n<p>Bowman says that officers are doing “limited enforcement” of scooters and responding on a complaint basis.</p>\n<p>Despite this, students have ridden the scooters on campus with little to no consequences.</p>\n<p>To better regulate these policies, UCSB formed a committee which includes several university organizations such as Associated Students, UCPD and Transportation and Parking Services among others, according to Jennifer Lofthus, UCSB’s policy coordinator and deputy ADA compliance officer.</p>\n<p>The Committee is considering geofencing as one form of regulation, which would shut off scooters once they pass a certain geographical location, said Associate Dean of Students Don Lubach at the Graduate Student Association meeting Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>In UCSB’s case, this could be Pardall Tunnel, Lubach said.</p>\n<p>At the I.V. CSD meeting on Oct. 9, Bird City Launcher Benjamin Jacobs discussed Bird’s plans to institute a “no-ride zone” for campus on the Bird app.</p>\n<p>“People will… get a notification that they’re entering a no-ride zone which we can tag based on [the university’s] requirements,” Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>The company currently does not have plans to throttle the scooters entering campus.</p>\n<p>Bird also plans to hire members of the I.V. community as “bird sweepers or watchers” who would manage the removal of Bird scooters on campus as well as educating users on how to safely operate the product, Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members also expressed concern about the safety of Bird scooters in I.V., highlighting the potential for accidents and hazardous misuse of the scooters.</p>\n<p>As an example of the I.V. CSD’s worries about the scooters, I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman pointed out that a Bird scooter had washed up onto the beach over the weekend.</p>\n<p>In response, Jacobs said the initial sign-up process on Bird’s app requires users to watch a video that explains the rules of scooter use, which includes riding only on streets, wearing a helmet and limiting the number of persons per scooter to one.</p>\n<p>Jacobs also added that safety is a “priority” for the Bird company.</p>\n<p>The company is also considering taking the scooters off streets in I.V. during periods when high alcohol consumption among residents is likely, he said. This effort would be in hopes of reducing the amount of people operating Bird scooters while intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD said Santa Barbara County plans to set regulations regarding the use of scooters in unincorporated territory, such as I.V., in November.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 9, 2019]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

His bail is set at $1 million.</p>\n<p>In Doe 1’s case, Galoustian allegedly found the victim intoxicated in a parking lot and “helped her up to his apartment,” Herman said.</p>\n<p>Galoustian was arrested on <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/owner-of-iv-menus-arrested-on-3-felony-charges-of-rape-pleads-not-guilty/\">four felony charges</a> on Dec. 18 by the UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD).</p>\n<p>UCSB sent out a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/suspect-arrested-for-reported-rape-in-isla-vista/\">timely warning</a> on Dec. 19, 2017 regarding the incident but did not name the suspect at that time.</p>\n<p>Those charges include kidnap to commit robbery or rape, rape of a drugged and intoxicated victim, penetration with foreign object and two counts of oral copulation by use of force or injury.</p>\n<p>In Doe 2’s case, Galoustian and Doe 2 allegedly began text correspondence in November 2017, when Galoustian was in Isla Vista and Doe 2 was in Los Angeles, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>The two then arranged for Galoustian to have sex with Doe 2 in exchange for money, a price they haggled over before settling on $1,200, according to text messages presented in court.</p>\n<p>“So $1.2k for entire day of sleepover,” read the message from Doe 2 to Galoustian.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 22, 2017, Galoustian indicated that he was going to travel to Los Angeles to meet Doe 2, according to the text messages.</p>\n<p>Galoustian then traveled to Los Angeles to have sex with Doe 2, according to Robert Sanger, Galoustian’s lawyer. Doe 2 then returned with Galoustian to Santa Barbara for a photoshoot.</p>\n<p>UCPD Detective Alexis Dougherty also confirmed this during her testimony on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The UCPD, through its own investigation, found videos on Galoustian’s phone, according to Dougherty. In some of the videos Doe 2 is seen participating in sexual activity, while in others she appears to be asleep or unconscious.</p>\n<p>Sanger questioned whether the evidence could be proved criminal in nature, referring to the “arrangement where payment for sex” was made, footage where the victim “appeared to have her eyes open sometimes, aware sometimes, participating sometimes,” and the photoshoot the two participated in the next day.</p>\n<p>Sanger further alleged that all sexual activity with Doe 2 occurred in Los Angeles. He argued Galoustian’s case should be tried under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles County Court as opposed to Santa Barbara County, with a motion to set aside the indictment.</p>\n<p>However, Herman said because Galoustian brought Doe 2 back to Santa Barbara County, it is rightfully Santa Barbara County’s case to try.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Herman denied the motion to set aside the indictment or information.</p>\n<p>Herman also said Galoustian presents a history of taking advantage of women in “improper mental conditions,” citing Doe 1’s intoxication and Doe 2’s alleged drugging by Galoustian.</p>\n<p>Herman set Galoustian’s readiness and settlement conference for Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>The prosecution expects the trial in January to take six weeks, or approximately 18 court days.</p>\n<p>Court documents can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Galoustian-Court-Cases.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Lan Nguyen contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p>Correction [Jun. 26, 2019]: Judge James Herman’s name was previously incorrectly spelled as Hernan.</p>\n<p>Updated [Oct. 21]: This article was updated to include pdfs of the court documents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
