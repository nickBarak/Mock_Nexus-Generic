One of those recreations included putting up posters of the original blackboard messages that students left for the victims in 2014 by the University Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re basically replicating that this year because we wanted to bring back the initial reaction and memory of the five year anniversary,” Meijer added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vigil and walk from Storke Tower to Anisq’Oyo’ Park <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/281778196041141/\">taking place</a> on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. is also a tribute to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-05-25/isla-vista-community-gathers-to-mourn-share-memories-of-those-lost/\">initial vigil</a> that took place two days after the shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president for the I.V. Community Services District, spoke about how I.V.’s  high turnover rate means it can be harder for students to learn about the tragedy when they first come to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My generation of students wasn’t here for the tragedy. And we were the ones who sort of were watching from a distance. I know I remember the day that it happened, I remember reading about it on the news and actually talking about it with my friends just because the details were so horrific,” said Brandt, who will graduate this spring with the class of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important that we keep talking about it and that we keep recognizing just the horror of what happened, because it is so important to how our community has developed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the sorority Delta Delta Delta, more commonly known as <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/tri-delta-to-suspend-operations-at-end-of-school-year/\">Tri Delta</a>, closing down at the end of this year and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/coffee-collab-mural-commemorates-tragedy/\">Coffee Collaborative</a>’s future uncertain, I.V. is losing some of the physical markers of remembrance people once used to learn about the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the months after the shooting, a memorial swing bench honoring two Tri Delta sisters who lost their lives in the shooting, Veronika Weiss and Katie Cooper, was given to the Tri Delta house. Coffee Collaborative has a mural dedicated to the six victims and has intentionally left a bullet hole in the window from that day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every four years, we have almost an entirely new town in terms of the population and who lives here,” Brandt said. “I’ve been happy to see that at least in the instance with the Tri Delt bench that it’s found a home </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the last that I heard </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with parents of one of the victims.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the student population at UCSB essentially resets every four years, many staff and faculty members who were here in 2014 are still here today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life, has been working at UCSB for 28 years and has worked to help the community heal for the past five years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first time this year, Armistead said, the Academic &amp; Staff Assistance Program (A.S.A.P.)  is putting together <a href=\"https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/events/asap-may-23-iv-tragedy-commemoration-and-reflection-five-years-later\">an event</a> for staff members to “reflect, connect and nourish.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event is described as an informal space for staff and faculty members to come together and will be facilitated by A.S.A.P. Manager Kirsten Olson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t feel as cohesive because now we’ll be with students who are honoring and respecting and remembering, but they weren’t necessarily here,” Armistead said. “And so this space created for staff and faculty is pretty special.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast, Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, arrived on campus during Fall Quarter 2015 and said it has “been a learning process for [her] in terms of what were the impacts and how have those changed over time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I.V. might be losing some of its physical reminders of the tragedy, Klawunn pointed to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/\">lights in Pardall Tunnel</a>, which were installed as part of a memorial project in 2015, and the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/\">Love and Remembrance Garden</a> in I.V. as examples of how the community has created its own ways to remember and honor the victims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to acknowledging the experiences of faculty and staff members who were here in 2014, Meijer touched upon the experiences of the first responders who were there as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[For] some of them, that’s the worst night of their life. They were the ones there; they were the ones who were seeing everything happen,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As two students who weren’t at UCSB in 2014, former A.S. President Brooke Kopel said she and Meijer had been speaking to people who were at the university and could talk about the ways in which the community came together in the days after the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bringing that community back together when you’re remembering is really important and making sure that that legacy and that history is being passed down so that no new generation of UCSB students ever forgets what happened,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said that while people would talk about the shooting during the year, there wasn’t a “place to center yourself and focus on remembering the people’s lives” outside of the annual vigils.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way to keep reminding students that this tragedy happened in their community just five years before is by holding these vigils and memorial events, Kopel and Meijer both said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t want to present it in a way that’s gonna make people not want to see it or not want to remember, because healing in that way is always so hard,” Kopel said. “But I think that just by people walking past those boards, for example, maybe first years, they’re gonna stop and see it and they make initial contact with it once and they’re gonna now know that for the rest of their four years here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It really only takes one instance of contact or a story passed down or knowledge passed down for that to continue on. And I don’t think that people in this community are ever gonna forget that this happened.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseño first introduced a modification to Legal Code at the Feb. 6 Senate meeting that would codify the one-time exception process that Salari went through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referred to as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Policy-36.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing Policy 36</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the legislation would have updated Legal Code to clarify the consequences and proper procedures moving forward for senators “who [were] voted in to represent a certain sector of the student body but due to external circumstances no longer can identify with those constituents,” the policy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No longer “identify[ing] with those constituents” includes living off-campus when they were elected as on-campus senators or changing colleges as a collegiate senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Standing Policy 36, senators would have been allowed to continue serving in their positions if the Senate felt they were adequately “attending office hours, attending BCU meeting[s], attending senate meetings, and [fulfilling] their other senatorial duties outlined per legal code,” and granted them an exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was tabled for a week at the Feb. 6 meeting. All bills are required to be tabled for a week before they are voted on, per Legal Code.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 13 meeting, several senators raised concerns about the Senate being the ones to grant an exemption, given that it is a partisan body. Standing Policy 36 was voted on and failed with nine yeses, ten noes and two abstentions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 20 Senate meeting, Uribe and Briseno introduced another bill to update the eligibility section of Legal Code. This one, however, gave the power to grant exemptions to the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.), who runs for the position independently and is required by Legal Code to be nonpartisan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill also broadened the scope of who could receive exemptions, allowing for an elected official, including the S.A.G., to be granted an exemption for not meeting the eligibility requirements spelled out in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year’s S.A.G., Grecia Martinez, was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/s-a-g-martinez-found-in-violation-of-legal-code-by-a-g-safadi/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found in violation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the very same portion of Legal Code by A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi, who released a statement on Feb. 26. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the statement, Safadi acknowledged that “the course of action regarding Ms. Martinez becomes unclear due to the fact that the requirements for elected officers start and end in that very article [of] the Legal Code.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ambiguity of the legal code on the Ms. Martinez’s case is simply a microcosm of the larger problem at hand with the text: countless incompletions and uncertain instructions that arise only when cases pertaining to such occur,” Safadi added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez maintained that she interpreted that portion of legal code as an expectation, and not an obligation, in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That bill was also </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/a-s-senate-tables-bill-to-clarify-consequences-for-elected-officials-who-dont-meet-eligibility-requirements/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tabled for a week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, per Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 27 Senate meeting, the bill was tabled once again. Uribe said that Elections Board had reached out to him and Briseño, asking for clarification about the bill. Since neither of them could meet with the Board before the Senate meeting, they decided to postpone the vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Uribe said he and Briseño have been unable to meet with Elections Board, particularly since all parties were busy with Spring 2019 elections. The bill has now essentially termed out, Uribe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe said that he had no plans to introduce a new version of the bill at the 69th Senate’s last meeting this Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was the only senator who is really interested in fulfilling the bill,” Uribe said. “There were people who I knew who agreed, who would have voted for the bill and who would have definitely loved it, but just not enough people…. the way I saw it, there was not enough people to get it passed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe still believes that some version of this bill is necessary, and said that he hoped Senator-elect Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who he has been training, will pick up where he left off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, Uribe said, a new bill would give senators the power to grant exemptions to executives, and vice versa, which would allow for A.S. to maintain a system of checks and balances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he acknowledged the concerns other senators had raised about the Senate being partisan, Uribe said he didn’t believe it would be a problem because the vote would require a two-thirds majority, and one party typically does not win that many seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a clarification of the path forward for elected officials within A.S. who fail to meet the eligibility requirements, that portion of Legal Code will continue to be what several A.S. officials have referred to as a “gray area.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

apartment building. </span><em>Courtesy of I.V. CSD</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BigSpeak CEO Jonathan Wygant and Anacapa Development owner Terry Huggins are interested in redeveloping the area to increase the amount of affordable housing in I.V. as well as to create more startup/incubator spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wygant, whose family owns Embarcadero Hall and has a financial agreement with UC Santa Barbara that ends in 2026, said he and his siblings felt that the building could be better utilized than as just a lecture hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wygant and Huggins were both familiar with the <a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/ceo/successor-agency/isla-vista-master-plan.sbc\">Isla Vista Master Plan</a>, “a planning document for the Isla Vista area which sets forth community goals and policies to guide the future growth of Isla Vista,” and felt there was an opportunity to further develop the community, starting with the Loop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After surveying the area, the two said they wanted to create “something that could serve the community at a higher level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposed renovations involve turning the Embarcadero Hall lot into an apartment building. The two would then renovate the strip of restaurants on Embarcadero Del Mar </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naan Stop, Dumpling King, Deja Vu and Rosarito </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to a multi-story building with a lecture hall, restaurants, co-working offices and startup/incubator offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building where the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) currently holds its meetings, 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, would become another multi-use building, housing a new I.V. Community Center and the I.V. CSD offices on the bottom floor and apartments on the upper floors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final building that Wygant and Huggins want to renovate is the current I.V. Community Center building, which is already under renovation by the I.V. CSD. Wygant and Huggins would relocate the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic to the first floor of this building, and then fill the rest of the bottom floor with restaurants. The upper floors would be more startup/incubator offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We think that with everything that’s going on, particularly in the hard sciences out of UCSB, it could be a great place to start a business in collaboration with one of the departments or several of the departments over at UCSB,” Huggins said. “And there really isn’t anything like that in Isla Vista right now. But we’d like to provide it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins added that the new spaces would incentivize recently graduated students to stay in I.V. because of the businesses as well, although Board Director Jay Freeman questioned whether the two had actually done research on the demand for tech companies in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two envision all of the buildings to be four stories tall, but said none of them would exceed 45 feet in height. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In between the three buildings located on the Embarcadero Del Mar side of the Loop, Huggins envisions a considerable amount of patio space, where students can “sit outside and have a cup of coffee.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Huggins and Wygant don’t currently own the strip of restaurants on Embarcadero Del Mar, Huggins said he was “working on something.” Since the proposal is still in very early stages, Huggins said he didn’t want to take action on possibly purchasing other buildings in the Loop just yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not trying to replace the established places that people like to go in Isla Vista to eat or drink. We just want to redevelop this in a way that adds to the community rather than takes away from other people’s businesses,” Huggins added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two also believe that retail around this area would be “really revitalize[d]” by the renovations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Huggins and Wygant stressed the community benefits of the renovations, the proposal met backlash from the packed room, with several long-term residents and community members expressing concern about the potential loss of public spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Someone’s gotta say something you guys,” Pegeen Soutar, vice chairperson of the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District and a resident of I.V. for 35 years, said, kicking off public comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I spent some time with both these gentlemen and I’ve tried to go into things with an open mind and my concern is always for the community, but I have concerns about even this variation of the plan,” Soutar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a community center finally; after many, many years, it’s going to be open in August. We’ve been waiting 40 years for this and I think it’s going to be beautiful…I think it’s going to be what we need and it’s a great start for us. If somewhere in the future we decide we need more space, when we’ve proven that we’ve burst out of the doors of that one, then I think that’s something that we as a community can discuss,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So, I’m not, right now, seeing a benefit to the community to put things on hold or to change things that already exist right now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soutar also pointed out the lack of parking allocation in the plan or any research on the environmental impact of having more people frequenting the Loop. Soutar said she respected the two for reaching out and asking the community for feedback, but said “at this point, I’m so excited for what we have already.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Food Co-Op General Manager Melissa Cohen echoed Soutar’s comments, pointing out that having that many UCSB students on that side of the Loop would cause a slew of traffic problems for cars, bikers and pedestrians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another community member stood up, pointed at the proposal sketch and dryly said, “Welcome to Los Angeles, eventually.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once public comment was over, the I.V. CSD returned to its discussion and questioning. All the board members expressed concern with I.V. losing the public spaces that it very recently created for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSD Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said he was uncomfortable with the idea of people coming in from the outside and changing the landscape of I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of this is a process of questions, and questions are important. But there is also a visceral reaction that I’m sure some of us in this room have which is somehow beyond those questions,” Hedges said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At least three of us remaining on the board sit here because… one of our taglines was ‘nothing for us without us.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Visioning is something best done by those who will live out that vision rather than those who have good ideas from the outside. That’s not to say that good ideas can’t come from outside,” Hedges said. “But I’m not ready for this, I’m really not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins and Wygant plan to take all the feedback they received into consideration before deciding how they want to proceed. They both anticipate being present at future I.V. CSD meetings and will continue speaking with community members about how to make their proposed renovations more community-friendly.</span></p>\n<div class=\"_3_bl\">\n<div class=\"_5w1r _3_om _5wdf\">\n<div class=\"_4gx_\">\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"_1aa6\"><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the </span></em><span class=\"_5yl5\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">.</span></em></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

CSD’s elections year was approved on April 9. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mailers were recently distributed to I.V. residences to notify voters of the change, announcing that the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) would now hold its elections during the statewide general election beginning on Nov. 3, 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combining the district’s election with the general election is a change that would save the district approximately $83,000 this year alone, CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said at the district’s Jan. 8 meeting, during which the district voted to petition for the election year change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positions on the board were previously up for election during odd-numbered years because the I.V. CSD </span><a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=10505.&amp;lawCode=ELEC\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially formed in March of 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even though it was voted into existence in the 2016 general election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the CSD was created by the voters, it was with the intent to elect Board Members during even year elections,” Board President Spencer Brandt said in a message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said that in 2018, the county elections office informed the I.V. CSD that the district could not conduct an election for board members in the 2018 midterm general elections, “citing a quirk in State election law.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Elections Code 10505 </span><a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=10505.&amp;lawCode=ELEC\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mandates </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that “if the district is formed in an odd-numbered year, the officers elected at the formation election shall hold office until noon on the first Friday in December of the next following odd-numbered year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renee Bischof, chief deputy registrar of voters for Santa Barbara County, reached out in early January to Abboud to inform him that </span><a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-10404.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Code 10404</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would allow the I.V. CSD to petition the Board of Supervisors for the change, Abboud said at the Jan. 8 CSD meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bischof also told Abboud that all other special districts in the county had already moved their elections to even-numbered years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $83,000 the district will save amounts to almost 10% of the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/i-v-csd-tax-nets-half-a-million-less-than-estimated/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD’s total budget.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said it would cost between $93,000 to $98,000 for I.V. CSD to hold its own election in an odd-numbered year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district would still spend some money in the 2020 election but would not spend nearly as much as they would holding their own election. Abboud cited the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June 2018 Measure R election</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in which the district paid $11,000, as an example of cost-saving during an even-numbered year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The research is conclusive that even-year elections allow public agencies to spend fewer tax dollars conducting elections, and foster more democratic participation,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said the county calculated the savings estimate by tallying the number of registered voters in I.V. and applying a cost of approximately $1.50 to each one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three positions on the board of directors will now be up for grabs in the 2020 general election, as opposed to fall 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those positions are currently held by Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Director Ethan Bertrand and Director Kristie Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen’s and Hedges’s seats will also be extended from two-year terms to four-year terms in the 2020 election, per Government Code section </span><a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-61250.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61250(e)(1)(A)(i)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seat currently held by Bertrand will continue to be a two-year term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt and Director Jay Freeman, who originally ran for four-year terms, will have their terms extended from Dec. 2021 to Dec. 2022. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The same feeling happened for me last year when we [started] Sunfest and students showed up!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SunFest, nicknamed “A Warm Up for the WarmUp,” is a festival hosted in Storke Plaza from 3  p.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and was put together for the first time last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our biggest hope is that students are safe and they have choices,” Armistead added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead also wrote that many of the alternative events were planned in “close consultation” with students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeike Meijer, who serves as the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) within Associated Students, said her office was particularly focused on education when preparing for Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In coordination with the Alcohol and Drug Program, the office put together naloxone trainings for students to learn how to respond to opiod overdoses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her office also partnered with SBSO and UCPD to host a Pizza with the Police event at Woodstock’s Pizza from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, the EVPLA office will host a town hall at Pardall Center from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. for community members to debrief Deltopia and discuss any concerns they might have had. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We basically just tried to fill up this week with as many events as possible in the spirit of education and prevention and providing resources,” Meijer said. This is the first time the EVPLA office has put together a prevention week, she said, and she hopes that the next EVPLA will continue to grow the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer has also been working with UCIV, a volunteer program to assist students when they’re out and about during Deltopia, to set up the hydration stations in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V.

I see the program as a valuable way that students have taken more responsibility over the IV community, and promoted a culture of greater safety during large events,” Brandt wrote in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt himself has volunteered with UCIV in the past, and has “enjoyed seeing the love and appreciation from students when we have handed out water, snacks, and condoms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking on Deltopia as a whole, Brandt echoed sentiments by Hoover, Armistead and Meijer that keeping I.V. safe is a community effort. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the past few years, the trend towards fewer arrests and citations that we’ve seen are a testament to the work that students, law enforcement, and the community have done to try to change the culture in IV,” he wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer agreed, attributing the improvements in safety to the sheer number of organizations working together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of different people who are making an effort to have Deltopia be safe and have it be local, and have it be like a community event,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s safe and it’s local, then everyone who’s there is truly caring about the community because it’s our home. No one wants to make a mess in their own home.”</span></p>\n<p><i>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe contributed reporting.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said at the launch on Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt recalled the first time he visited I.V. with his family and said it was “clear from the beginning that this was a place that was special.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was also clear what my parents’ opinion of it was, which was that it’s weird that there are mattresses lying on the corner, and that there’s trash in the gutters,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all know, standing here today, both as folks who have lived in Isla Vista and those who have been coming here for years, that’s not what Isla Vista is really about. But it does say something about the fact that there is a lot of quality of life issues that can be improved here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt hopes to appease these concerns through the use of SeeClickFix. By using the app as a mobile steward, users can help keep the streets of I.V. clean simply with their phones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt noted that there’s been a “rise in rhetoric” in the county that has dehumanized houseless people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really think that in Isla Vista, we here can be a model for trying to solve these problems and help them get back on their feet rather than pretending that if we just push things out of sight, out of mind, that the issue doesn’t exist,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who also spoke at the launch Sunday, took a moment to acknowledge Cesar Chavez’s birthday, and the “community building behaviors” that he demonstrated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann referenced the <a href=\"https://streetsteam.org/index\">Downtown Streets Team</a> in the Bay Area, which works toward “ending homelessness by restoring the dignity and rebuilding the lives of unhoused men and women,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They first did a survey of homeless people and found that it’s not being cold, it’s not being hungry, it’s being invisible. That’s the hardest thing about being homeless,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this program allows really a triple bottom line: to give people jobs and get them engaged, it makes your community better and it makes each one of us more connected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christina Lydick, beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista, said the program was going through the final stages of hiring at the moment. She anticipates bringing on five to seven people to work on graffiti abatement and other beautification initiatives in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers on Sunday went to work tackling the first few requests sent in by I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud to clean up the I.V. Community Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud initially utilized SeeClickFix in 2012, when he worked in Associated Students. Back then, he said, the program was much simpler, and there was no designated group working to fix the problems.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working on county issues and trying to figure out how we can make Isla Vista better with no local government back then,” he said. “We’d see what people put in and we’d try to work on them each without a coherent system and without dedicated staff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the I.V. CSD was looking for ways to launch the beautification program, they considered simpler options, like Google Forms, but knew that it wouldn’t give them the ability to collect the data that they wanted to, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once they reached out to SeeClickFix, the board found it to be the most effective and reasonably priced option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said the district spent approximately $5,700 for a one-year subscription, which included the district with two accounts, one for Abboud and one for Lydick, and the support of the SeeClickFix team in setting up and managing the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The service has improved exponentially since Abboud first used it when he was an undergraduate, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Before it was [a] very text-based website…I don’t even think it had a GPS,” he said. “It was brand new.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the program is much more user-friendly, he said, and the company has helped the I.V. CSD set up the front end of their app and design a workflow system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud also noted that it has been helpful to hear from the company about how other cities have developed their apps. For the I.V. CSD, one of the most important aspects of the app is its ability to collect data on the kind of work requests it is receiving and how many of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the long term if we had that data accumulate, we’ll just know better in terms of how we’re spending our money and what we’re getting done,” Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the work orders are limited to graffiti, trash, vandalism and lighting issues for now, the board hopes to expand it to include fixing potholes and uneven sidewalks, and even potentially partnering with UC Santa Barbara to collect work orders for on-campus problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll do things like that in the future, but we wanted to launch with what we can, with a minimum viable product, which is this beautification kind of stuff, and then we’ll move towards other areas in the future,” Abboud said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said the increase was vital, as the UC would have a $30 million hole in its funding without the hike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we are recommending… is a modest increase in non-resident student tuition, 2.6 percent. It’s basically a cost-of-living adjustment,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our primary purpose is to educate the next generation of Californians.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association (UCSA) has been the loudest voice against the tuition hike. UCSA President Caroline Siegel-Singh delivered a letter to state legislators on March 6, opposing both a non-resident student cap and the tuition hike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we discuss the importance of an affordable UC education, we cannot neglect that non-residents contribute a total of $120 million towards need-based financial aid through the UC grant and therefore support approximately 100,000 California residents,” the letter read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Sherry Lansing first proposed not voting on the issue, saying that she “came in with one point of view” and now felt conflicted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think there is so much more work to do on this. I think that we should hold off on this if possible and really talk to the legislature and really look at possible scholarships and how we handle this situation,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hadi Makarechian, chair of the Finance and Capital Strategies Committee, presented a recommendation from the committee to move forward with the $762 tuition increase, but said that there was opposition to the increase within the committee, including from himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several Regents voiced their concerns about the tuition hike, saying it would make the UC less of a “world-class institution” and accessible only to the very wealthy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Michael Cohen also pointed out that the increase would affect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) students who might be California residents but do not qualify for in-state tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When [students] get on campus, for me they’re all California students, and we have sort of a moral obligation to treat them the same way we would all of our other students,” he said about out-of-state students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent John A. Pérez said that until the Regents “reopen the discussion about pathways for financial aid for out-of-state students,” he could not support the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez also recommended “admission group cohort increases,” which would mean that when accepted, students would pay the listed rate at the time for the four years they attend a UC. Any tuition increases voted on when they are in school would not affect students currently enrolled, keeping tuition the same for a class of students when they first enter school up until they graduate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Regents plans to reconsider the tuition hike at their next meeting in May, which will be held at UC San Francisco. In the meantime, they will explore other avenues to resolve the $30 million budget hole, they decided at today’s meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One option they are looking to is asking the state legislature for money to sustain the programs that would be cut without the hike, as Napolitano noted that the state would not provide funds for out-of-state students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also intend to look for a way to differentiate DACA students from out-of-state and international students and develop a way to provide financial assistance for out-of-state students. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-86673\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Police Department (UCPD) was the first and only organization to express interest in the space as of December 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Bagel Cafe, Mojo Teahouse, the Isla Vista Trading Post and Off-Campus Senator Sydney Karmes-Wainer have reached out to Gary Lawrence], University Center (UCen) director, to ask about the space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would say that all of the inquiries have been informal and of the “information gathering” type,” Lawrence said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD previously said that if they submitted a proposal for the space, they would be primarily interested in using it as a Community Service Organization (CSO) station. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This space could enable the UC Police Department and its members to more effectively and routinely interact with the campus community in non-enforcement contacts,” UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-08/kaplan-ends-ucen-contract-ucpd-eyes-vacated-space/\">said</a> in December. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the difficulties in filling the space is that it does not have a kitchen, but instead a classroom, which may rule out food-based businesses. </span></p>\n<p><b>MOJO TEAHOUSE</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mojo Teahouse owner Boxi Wang said that if Mojo Teahouse was selected for the space, they would only serve drinks. The location in Isla Vista serves drinks in addition to food items such as popcorn chicken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From my understanding, it’s a pretty cool thing to sell boba at school. I’ve been to some campuses, but I don’t think [any] of them sell boba on campus,” Wang said. “They all have coffee and other alternatives, like let’s say Jamba Juice, over there, but they don’t have anything that’s like more towards Asians.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, having a location on campus would allow Mojo Teahouse to pick up some morning sales that they miss out on by being in I.V., Wang added. </span></p>\n<p><b>BAGEL CAFE</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bagel Cafe Manager Jacob Root said that he had reached out to ask about a space in the UCen in late December or early January, but was told that there weren’t any available spaces at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re looking to put a satellite-type location out there,” Root said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would definitely need to make it semi-kitchen ready because we would want to bake bagels fresh over there,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Root hasn’t been able to check out the location yet, however, and said that he was waiting to hear back from Lawrence about the space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’d have to look at the space, like I said, I just don’t know how many square feet it is, where the location is,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><b>ISLA VISTA TRADING POST</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Trading Post co-president Julia Rose Feldman said the organization has been looking for a permanent space for a while, especially since they are outgrowing their current storage space in another member’s garage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now we have just been working with our event-based model, which is great for what it is, but we’ve kind of outgrown the model,” Feldman, a fourth-year environmental studies major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At a few of our events we weren’t able to have the event for as long as we said we would because we just didn’t have anything to give out,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having the permanent space would allow the I.V. Trading Post to keep more donations as well as create a space on campus where “where [students] know that the clothes [they donate] are going to be going to another loving home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are excited about the potential opportunity to have the space, but due to limited funding i’m not exactly sure if it’s going to be at all possible,” Feldman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We haven’t heard back about how much it’s going to cost, and as a relatively new organization, we have about $2,000 to our org’s name, so we’re not sure whether or not it’s even feasible.”</span></p>\n<p><b>SENATOR KARMES-WAINER</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer reached out to inquire about potentially putting a hot food bar in the space. She put out a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/\">petition</a> calling for a hot food bar on campus in January and has since been working in Senate to try to make it a reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need a proper arrangement where students can build their own healthy meals, like a build-a-bowl hot bar with options for a clean protein, roasted vegetables, whole grains, &amp; healthy fats,” Karmes-Wainer wrote in the original <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/university-of-california-santa-barbara-ucsb-healthy-hot-bar\">petition</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer declined to comment about the potential leasing of the space until she had more information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vacant UCen space is currently occupied by the UCSB’s Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Services (HDAE) after its main office was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-02/housing-services-plants-new-roots-in-ucen-following-tree-damage/\">damaged</a> by an early February storm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawrence said HDAE would be in the vacant UCen space for approximately two to four months, but that he didn’t anticipate their occupancy having any effect on future rentals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDAE is currently paying the standard rate while it uses the space. Kaplan paid $4,420 per month to rent the space. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

By withdrawing from Fall Quarter 2018, Martinez violated this section of Legal Code, Safadi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is unclear if Martinez will face any repercussions for the violation. In the statement, Safadi emphasized that there are no discernible consequences in Legal Code for executives who do not complete the required six units. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ambiguity of the legal code on the Ms. Martinez’s case is simply a microcosm of the larger problem at hand with the text: countless incompletions and uncertain instructions that arise only when cases pertaining to such occur,” Safadi wrote in her statement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nowhere in the legal code does it state what the implications for the incompletion of (6) units are and nowhere in the legal code does it discuss actions on an elected official’s honoraria in the case of such incompletion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi also referenced the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/four-a-s-executives-over-last-5-years-were-not-enrolled-in-school-in-possible-violation-of-legal-code/\"> article</a> which found that four executives over the last five years were either not enrolled or took fewer than six units during their terms of service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, it was unclear what it meant for elected officers to “complete” six units, Safadi noted in a previous interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Upon communication with the Office of the Registrar at (805) 893-3592, University Policies were made evident and withdrawing from a quarter equates incomplete units and therefore it would not have been possible for Ms. Martinez to meet that (6) unit requirement expected from “Appointed and Elected officers,”” she wrote in her statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez maintained that she did not believe she violated Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In Zeina’s interpretation, in her experience serving for the last two quarters, she interpreted it as ‘that’s the requirement you need to hold the position,’” Martinez said. “As my experience as senator, that’s not how I interpreted it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t really say that there should be a consequence because I don’t really see it as black and white in terms of just me violating it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said she believed the main point of Safadi’s statement was to draw attention to the lack of clarity in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue of eligibility has come up several times during the 2018-2019 school year within A.S., most prominently with Martinez and former On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari. Salari was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\">removed</a> from her position early last week after Judicial Council ruled that she violated the eligibility portion of the code by living off-campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to Salari’s situation, and to the ambiguity of Legal Code, Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno presented a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/a-s-senate-tables-bill-to-clarify-consequences-for-elected-officials-who-dont-meet-eligibility-requirements/\">bill</a> that would update the eligibility section of Legal Code at the Feb. 20 Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill would give the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) and the A.S. Executive Director, currently Marisela Marquez, the power to grant elected officials a one-time exception for failing to meet the eligibility requirements spelled out in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An original version of the bill was written to only apply to senators, but an updated version sent out two hours before the Feb. 20 Senate meeting was expanded to include all elected officers, including executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill has since been tabled twice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez serves as a student sponsor on the bill, and said that as the only non-partisan office in A.S., she felt the S.A.G. was the best equipped to decide whether or not to grant an elected officer a one-time exception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi offered her office’s guidance to any senators who were interested in updating Legal Code, and urged the Judicial Council to write an advisory statement to the Senate to support its necessity. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-86546\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Simons and Delency created the podcast in 2015. Courtesy<em> of Blake Simons and Delency Parham</em></p></div>\n<p>The two Bay Area natives released the first episode of the “Hella Black Podcast” in 2015 with the goal of amplifying Black voices and covering topics that are often overlooked.</p>\n<p>“With each episode we hope to educate and inform our listeners on all things related to Blackness. Our podcast is important because it uplifts the voices of Black radical organizers who are doing the work in the field. Often times our narratives are not told,” the two wrote on their <a href=\"https://www.hellablackpod.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>Coming to UCSB as a podcast host is a welcome change for both Simons and Parham.</p>\n<p>Simons attended UC Berkeley as an undergraduate and Parham attended Santa Barbara City College before transferring to the University of Idaho. Both played sports at their respective universities.</p>\n<p>“I think about my experience as a student-athlete at SBCC, and it was hard enough getting folks on my own campus to take me serious. I experienced students at the UC thinking they were better than me and other students at the city college. So to come back here, and have students gathered in a room to listen to Blake and I host a live podcast…never something that would [have] crossed my mind,” Parham said in an email.</p>\n<p>The two only recently began doing live shows for the “Hella Black Podcast” in September 2018.</p>\n<p>“As the podcast started gaining more traction, we thought it would be dope to be able to engage with people and create a radical space in person to have the conversations we have. We’ve had shows in Oakland, Los Angeles, where over 100 people pulled up to each show,” Simons said in the email.</p>\n<p>While the two both have a background in writing, they realized that podcasting would allow them to reach a larger audience.</p>\n<p>“Folks might not have time to read a full article due to the constraints that capitalism puts on people, but you can listen to the podcast on your way to work or when you’re doing laundry,” Simons added.</p>\n<p>Alexandra Gessesse, financial director for the Black Student Union at UCSB, worked with A.S. Program Board Cultural &amp; Arts Coordinator Kiyomi Morrison to pull the event together.</p>\n<p>Gessesse wanted to bring the two to campus because of their experiences being Black on predominantly white campuses, and especially because of Simons’ work co-founding the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s BSU is currently trying to develop an agreement for UCSB to build a freestanding building where Black students can get access to resources and have a space for themselves.</p>\n<p>“Blake himself has pioneered a lot of what we are trying to achieve for here at our own campus, but having been a Cal alum, a UC product and having worked within the UC system for several years since he’s graduated, I felt like he could share insight to what it’s like being black within the UC,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>As an “avid listener of the podcast” herself, Gessesse believes the two tackle topics that are typically stigmatized. Some of the podcast episodes dive into sex work, the intersection of Blackness and queerness and exploitation of Black student athletes.</p>\n<p>“I want to take the time to acknowledge all the queer/trans folks, and Black women that have put in numerous hours of labor to help me develop healthier perspectives and radical politics. Blake and I like to use our platform as an opportunity to uplift their voices,” Parham said.</p>\n<p>“We both know in a patriarchal society, men’s voices will be the voices that are projected. We want to use our privilege to center the most disrespected and threatened, and be in solidarity with them.”</p>\n<p>Parham and Simons also cite their Bay Area roots and their familial connection to members of the Black Panther Party as the inspiration for their discussions.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest draws of the podcast is that the two also work as community organizers and educators, having their boots on the ground in addition to speaking on the subject.</p>\n<p>“Teaching is one way I build community and help educate Black people on the conditions of our people,” Simons said. “As community organizers we both create programs that center the most vulnerable Black people under this white supremacist capitalist state.”</p>\n<p>The two cofounded the People’s Breakfast Oakland, which provides houseless people with hot foods, clothing and hygiene products.</p>\n<p>Gessesse hopes that students attending the event come away with ideas about how to keep the needs of Black students in the fold even after Black History Month is over.</p>\n<p>“I really anticipate that not only does this talk, this conversation, does not stop at the end of February when Black History Month is over, but that we continue to make these strides in our community about coming together,” she said.</p>\n<p>At the same time, she hopes the show on Friday night can be a place where Black students come to unwind and be in a space tailor-made for them.</p>\n<p>“Being Black is political, yes, but not everything that Black people do has to be political.”</p>\n<p>Simons and Parham will be hosting their live show on Friday, March 1, at the Loma Pelona Center at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this story said that Simons alone hosts the People’s Breakfast Oakland. Simons and Parham co-founded it together.</em></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus<i>.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Director Jeanne Stanford.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Merchant, the demands played an integral role in her decision to work at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was inspired by the agency and activism of students to ask for what they need and to use their voices and resources to get their needs met.  I would not have left LA … if it had not been for the opportunity to respond to the call of Black students who were feeling unsupported, underrepresented, and invisible,” Merchant said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant, who grew up in Los Angeles but spent “15 summers in a row in Chicago where my parents were born,” said her parents moved to California to provide her with more opportunities than they believed she would have in Chicago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They instilled pride in being Black, demanded that I speak up for myself, and regularly told me that I could do anything that I put my mind to,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming a psychologist was a natural choice for Merchant, who said she has always been the person that friends confided in and looked to for advice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I chose to go to graduate school with the thought, ‘Everyone tells me their deepest darkest secrets and talks to be about anything, why not get paid to be me?’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant’s areas of focus are women’s health, academic success, overall student wellness and “empowering and supporting students who may feel marginalized and specifically students from the African Diaspora,” according to the C.A.P.S. website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have always worked in settings in which I advocated for underrepresented populations and helped give voice to the voiceless,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant cited her own personal experiences as the reason she cares so much about helping others find solutions to their problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My personal reproductive trauma, having a daughter (Nailah Asha) that died the day before her first birthday in 2006, led to me learning the statistic that Black college educated women are twice as likely to have an infant die than a white woman who drops of out high school,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My loss and this data, fueled my passion for being part of the solution that reduces levels of stress of people who look like me (and anyone else I come in contact with) because too many babies and mothers are dying unnecessarily due to the structural and institutional racism across the life span, lived and passed on through generations, and it needs to stop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant hopes to help Black students find peace and a sense of belonging and safety through counseling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At predominantly white serving institutions, more often than not, many students of color, and especially Black students find themselves fighting against being treated as inferior and as if they don’t belong before they even step into a classroom,” she wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students of color, particularly Black students, may not feel as comfortable asking for help as others for a variety of reasons, Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it’s a lack of trust in institutions, but there are also cultural stigmas for students of color who might be shamed for talking about their family’s private business or who worry about being called crazy, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is much easier to seek help if one feels as if someone understands their struggle and reduces the burden that students have felt to teach the counselor about the struggle to be Black at a white serving institution before they can get the help they need.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her time so far at UCSB, Merchant’s proudest accomplishment is establishing for Black students that she is there to support them and that she truly sees them. Since her and Barfield’s time at UCSB, Black students have utilized C.A.P.S. in larger numbers, Merchant said, and lately the program has been working to reach out to students more as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as she works to support Black students on campus, Merchant faces her own struggle on a predominantly white campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been lonely and overwhelming as the only Black female psychologist in CAPS,” she said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a Black staff member at UCSB mirrors the Black student experience in many ways and having community is essential and important for me too” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BSU Demands Team recently released a set of demands in early February, addressing the need for more Black student advocacy on campus, both institutionally and one-on-one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant believes the completion of these demands, particularly the construction of a building named the “Malcolm X Center for Black Student Development,” would increase Black student retention and graduation in a significant way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that it would be very supportive, empowering, and meaningful for Black students to have a place that they can call their own, where they feel a sense of belonging, and are encouraged, in word and action, to be their best selves.  Where they are guaranteed to see people who look like them and to trust that their needs are important and their existence is validated,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand for a freestanding building for Black students was one written into the first demands released in 1968. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all need to take more responsibility for our role in improving the mental health of all students.  This is not just the responsibility of psychologists in the counseling center but it is everyone’s responsibility,” Merchant wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“However, with respect to Black students who I believe make up the second smallest ethnic group on campus, greater efforts need to be made to create, sustain, and enrich the experiences and environment for Black students,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are people working independently on initiatives to improve Black student admission, retention and graduation rates, Merchant believes that centralizing those operations is key to being accessible to Black students who need help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also believes that while Student Affairs has prioritized diversity, inclusion and equity, individual professors and academic departments need to be held accountable for creating classrooms where Black students are not made to feel out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many Black students and other students of marginalized populations enter classrooms on the defense due to how they are treated by classmates as well as professors,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many professors are not held accountable for their complicit behavior and students suffer.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:12 a.m.]:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Merchant’s first name is Meridith, not Meredith.

makeup company, which is primarily sold online and in select Sephora and Ulta stores, garnered fame for its liquid lipsticks when it first launched and has since grown to encompass a variety of skincare and makeup products.</p>\n<p>Mukai has only been working for the company as a marketing intern for three weeks, but during this time has focused on laying the foundation for the college ambassador program alongside her supervisors at Colourpop.</p>\n<p>UCSB was chosen as the pilot school for the ambassador program after Mukai was selected as the intern and because of Santa Barbara’s vicinity to the Colourpop headquarters in Oxnard, Calif.</p>\n<p>“This will be kind of the test run to see what works, what doesn’t work, how to make the program better, how can we fit it to Colourpop better, how can we fit it to campuses better, so that when we start recruiting more schools we have kind of like that basic blueprint work in order to keep it going,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s main responsibilities as the college ambassador include running the social media platforms and organizing giveaways and trunk shows to highlight Colourpop’s product lines on campus.</p>\n<p>Mukai said that her passion for makeup is what sparked her interest in working for Colourpop.</p>\n<p>“I just was looking at the Linkedin job page every other day for weeks, and then finally a job popped up and I applied for it. I had a few rounds of interviews, and thank god I got the job!” Mukai laughed.</p>\n<p>Since Mukai is within driving distance from the headquarters, she travels to the office twice a week, where she works closely with a wide variety of departments.</p>\n<p>“Colourpop, for people that are into business and things like that, is a completely vertically integrated company, so like everything from like the conception of a product all the way to it going out of the doors and to a customer is all through Colourpop,” Mukai said.</p>\n<p>She described the office as having a “start-up feel,” and praised the company for the number of women in authority roles, a stark difference from a previous employer.</p>\n<p>“For me being a young person going into the workforce …. it’s really cool to see all these women of power like just doing the work. They are the reason why the company runs,” Mukai added.</p>\n<p>Being in the office also allowed her to get a better sense of the company’s personality, Mukai said, which has helped her learn more about how to merge the company’s brand and UCSB’s brand.</p>\n<p>Mukai officially launched UCSB’s Colourpop College Instagram page on Tuesday, and said she was pleasantly surprised by the reaction from UCSB students, noting that the page reached 500 followers in the first 24 hours.</p>\n<p>“The interesting part is either people absolutely know what [Colourpop] is and they love it or they’re like ‘what is this?’” she said.</p>\n<p>She had previously worked for two years as the campus representative for PINK, a subset of Victoria’s Secret, which she believes is why she was hired to help launch the Colourpop College program.</p>\n<p>While she says the responsibilities are similar on paper, it’s been a learning curve for Mukai as she transitions from advertising clothing to advertising makeup.</p>\n<p>“I’m trying to take what I learned from UCSB PINK and apply it to this, but I realize more and more how different it is being a representative or an ambassador for makeup rather than clothing, ‘cause everyone wears clothing – not everyone wears makeup,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86418\" style=\"width: 702px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86418\" data-attachment-id=\"86418\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/ucsb-student-lays-foundation-for-first-ever-colourpop-college-program/screen-shot-2019-02-21-at-11-46-49-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?fit=692%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"692,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-21 at 11.46.49 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?fit=250%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?fit=692%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86418 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?resize=692%2C650\" alt=\"\" width=\"692\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?w=692&amp;ssl=1 692w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?resize=250%2C235&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86418\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Even though makeup is her passion, Mukai said she wouldn’t consider herself an expert. She plans on reaching out to students on campus to populate the Instagram page with creative, hyperlocal and “eye-catching” content.</p>\n<p>After getting the program off the ground, Mukai wants to focus on spotlighting these students, especially those “with smaller followings than the big beauty influencers, but [who] are equally, if not more, talented.”</p>\n<p>She said that one of her favorite aspects of Colourpop is their attention to smaller influencers, and hopes to continue that at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I’ve already found so many talented people on campus,” Mukai said. “I get to bring those people to the forefront, like ‘look how beautiful they are! look at that cut crease, or look at that skin!’ and just kind of hopefully give them also a platform to succeed.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest talking points for the Colourpop College is the trunk shows that Mukai plans to host on campus. Since Colourpop is primarily an online store and only stocks certain Sephora or Ulta locations with a limited range of products, it is hard to get a good feel for the shades and textures of products before buying them, Mukai said.</p>\n<p>The trunk show plans to bring a large range of Colourpop products to campus so students can swatch, and even buy them, to their heart’s content.</p>\n<p>While Mukai is the sole college ambassador for now, she hopes that the program can grow both on campus and at college campuses across California and then across the country.</p>\n<p>“I think not only is this a great professional opportunity in terms of learning about the industry that you wanna be in, but also it’s just a really fun way to get to know people and share a community of people that love makeup and love beauty and love skincare and things of all those natures,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s love for Colourpop comes from both a consumer and a student point of view, she said. For one, Mukai praised the company for the affordability and quality of their products.</p>\n<p>“There is, more importantly, a range of colors that fit all skin tones, which I’ve been surprised to see,” she added.</p>\n<p>“I don’t mean to politicize makeup, but at this time and age, I don’t feel like you can’t politicize things, like I think that’s silly…. politics in some way touches every part of our lives, and I think that happens with makeup too, so it’s been great to see the makeup industry pay attention.”</p>\n<p>As she works to solidify the program in the coming months, Mukai hopes to ultimately build a community around beauty and skincare products for students.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s a really important part of this college program as it continues and hopefully grows, that they’ll be more of an uplifting of multiple people.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or skamidi@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Grecia Martinez, former EVPSA Kristin Hsu, former President James Villarreal ‘16 and former EVPSA Melvin Singh ‘15 – either withdrew or canceled their enrollment or took fewer than the required number of units at some point during their terms, according to student enrollment records.</p>\n<p>A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi said she is currently investigating Martinez’s withdrawal from Fall Quarter 2018 to determine whether there is cause for a Judicial Council case. Martinez said she believes she did not violate any requirement.</p>\n<p>Martinez withdrew from Fall Quarter 2018, Hsu canceled her Spring Quarter 2018 and Villarreal dropped below half-time during Winter Quarter 2016. Singh canceled Winter Quarter 2015 and there is no record of him attending UCSB in Spring Quarter 2015.</p>\n<p>Last spring, former EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> before being sworn in after it was discovered she had canceled her classes for the quarter, making her ineligible for her position.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if A.S. executives from previous years would have been allowed to serve if it came to light that they were taking fewer than six credits.</p>\n<p>Executive officers receive $3,000 per quarter – taken from student fees and paid directly to their BARC accounts — for serving the student body.</p>\n<p>Cindy Lopez, A.S. assistant director for finance and budget, confirmed that all executives who the <em>Nexus</em> found had withdrawn or canceled their enrollment or dropped below half-time over the last five years received their $3,000 stipends each quarter and that none had returned the money.</p>\n<p>Students who withdraw before the beginning of a quarter have their registration canceled and receive a full refund, the UCSB Office of the Registrar <a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/registration-enrollment/registration-enrollment/withdraw-from-the-university\">website</a> says. It is unclear what Hsu and Singh, the executives who canceled their quarters, used the $3,000 for.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez directed all questions regarding consequences for failing to meet eligibility requirements to Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>Raymond Alonso, who leads the Judicial Council, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>“What the Legal Code is missing are the consequences, if any, that come with not being enrolled as a student,” A.G. Safadi told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Martinez withdrew on Dec. 7, the last day of instruction for Fall Quarter 2018. Hsu declined to comment. Singh and Villarreal did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Records also show that two other executives, former A.S. President Hieu Le ‘18 and former S.A.G. Josephine Ampaw ‘17, did not complete the minimum six units for their respective quarters.</p>\n<p>However, Le withdrew from Spring Quarter 2018 about six days after his term had ended and his successor, current A.S. President Brooke Kopel, had taken office. Le declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Ampaw retroactively withdrew from two of her classes after the end of Fall Quarter 2016, citing a personal family emergency and a desire to protect her GPA.</p>\n<p>“At the time that I was doing S.A.G., I was in those classes,” Ampaw said in an interview. “It’d be important to also state that regardless of a family emergency, I still worked as S.A.G., and I still served the student population.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said she had not been aware of the executives who had withdrawn or canceled their enrollment or taken fewer than six units until she was informed by the <em>Nexus</em>. She said executives may not have known they had dipped below the six-unit minimum and that she wished she had known so she and other A.S. staffers could have provided them with resources and support.</p>\n<p>Lopez and Marquez are responsible for checking executives’ enrollment status before paying them, but Legal Code does not require them to check their enrollment status throughout the year.</p>\n<p>A.S. senators, BCU officers and all other non-executives who are paid by the association have their enrollment checked at the end of each quarter, making it more likely that a change in enrollment status would be caught and their honoraria affected, Lopez said.</p>\n<p>The $3,000 stipend for executives — originally intended to cover all or part of tuition — is paid before each quarter starts, on Sept. 15, Dec. 15 and March 15 for fall, winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>Marquez said that her job is to check an executive’s enrollment before paying them, and “outside of that, I would imagine that it’s on them to report it or give it back.”</p>\n<p>S.A.G. Martinez, who withdrew from the university while serving during the Fall Quarter 2018 but is currently enrolled, maintained that she did not violate the Legal Code and said there is a “gray area” in the eligibility clause.</p>\n<p>She argued that since the clause for executives falls under the eligibility portion of Legal Code, the by-laws serve as expectations for candidates running for positions, not obligations to be upheld.</p>\n<p>“This is supported by the fact that the clauses included in those same sections are all worded in language concerning a candidate’s [eligibility] for an election,” she wrote in a message after her interview.</p>\n<p>Martinez said Legal Code should be clarified so that expectations and exceptions for executives are clearly outlined.</p>\n<p>If a Judicial Council case were filed against her, Martinez said it would “spark a bigger conversation about what should be done in special situations like this,” but she doesn’t believe it would be the right step.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe I’m in violation,” Martinez said. “I mean, I was a student. I did my job and I was a student at the same time.”</p>\n<p>A full version of A.S. Legal Code can be viewed below.

Senate website by the end of week three of Winter Quarter. The resolution also directs the Senate to send out a University Announcement to the student body “to inform constituents about the website and how they can get in contact with senators.”</p>\n<p>Neither have been completed as of the beginning of week five. The resolution was passed during the Jan. 9 Senate meeting in week one.</p>\n<p>Ornelas said that updating the website was more complicated than he had originally imagined. He has been working with A.S. Web Developer JudyAnn Dutcher to make the necessary updates.</p>\n<p>“It’s just so complicated and not really user-friendly,” Ornelas said. “Honestly, it could happen by the end of this week, just to kind of make it like the [Finance and Business] visual builder, where I can just go in and edit stuff.”</p>\n<p>Ornelas also said he would try to get the University Announcement sent out by the end of the week.</p>\n<p>Senators Ricardo Uribe, Sydney Karmes-Wainer, Zion Solomon, Dallin Mello, Rafael Cornejo, Melissa Perez, Jalia Carlton-Carew, Xochitl Briseno, Ashley Ng, Alexis Bettencourt, Anthony Hernandez, Yara Khamis, Alli Adam, Jasmine Palmerin and Ornelas all created their pages by the end of week two, the deadline stated in the resolution.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 4, when the Nexus reached out to Senators Nima Bencohen, Adam Chohan, Yasamin Salari, Alex Funk and Andrew Nguyen, they had not created their public Facebook pages.</p>\n<p>Bencohen’s Facebook page went public less than an hour after the Nexus reached out. He thanked the Nexus reporter for “honestly reminding” him to make the page.</p>\n<p>“I was asking for assistance from one of my friends with making some of the graphics for the page and he has not been responding to me so this will do for now,” Bencohen added.</p>\n<p>Chohan said in an email to the Nexus that he had not made the page before the Nexus emailed him.</p>\n<p>“I had been posting my Senate information on my Facebook. My office hours were still public, just not on a page,” Chohan added. “Thank you for the reminder.”</p>\n<p>Salari said in an email that the making the public Facebook page “completely slipped [her] mind once school became harder after week 2.”</p>\n<p>“However my facebook page is now up and running for my constituents to use to reach out to me,” Salari said in an email.</p>\n<p>“With that being said I do think that the honoraria of all the senators that forgot to make their facebook pages should be docked since the original due date for the pages was week 2.”</p>\n<p>Ornelas said in an interview with the Nexus that he would recommend to Internal Vice President Steven Ho that senators who failed to make their pages by the deadline should have their honoraria docked. He estimated that the punishment should be $10 per week late, although he said it would be up to the honoraria committee’s discretion.</p>\n<p>Nguyen said that his page was created late due to personal issues, however he added that those issues are “an explanation, not an excuse.”</p>\n<p>Funk could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>Senators Lea Toubian, Carla Cernat and Gabriella Shofet created their pages on Jan. 22, and Senator Yash Nagpal made his on Jan. 23.</p>\n<p>Shofet said in an email to the Nexus that since she was sworn in during week two, she gave herself additional time to fulfill the requirements of the resolution.</p>\n<p>Toubian said in an email that she did make her page by the deadline, but later deleted it due to not having a headshot. Toubian cleared it with Ornelas first.</p>\n<p>Cernat attributed her tardiness to the “tumultuous” nature of the first two weeks, but takes “full responsibility” for creating the page late.</p>\n<p>“As I’m sure many students can relate, the first two weeks of any quarter can be an exceptionally busy and difficult time as we try to crash classes, finalize our class and work schedules, get back into a normal routine and prioritize our mental health,” Cernat said in an email.</p>\n<p>Cernat is “not sure” how honoraria would be docked or what amount should be docked for senators who did not abide by the resolution deadline.</p>\n<p>“If senators’ honoraria was to be docked for creating a public Facebook page late, I would then also expect the executive officers, who receive a guaranteed $3,000 in honoraria, to receive a similar amount of scrutiny and oversight for completing all of their required duties, trainings and obligations as senators do,” Cernat added.</p>\n<p>Nagpal said in an email that he did create his page by the week two deadline, but the page “did not go live to the public for a few days” because Facebook required him to complete the entire page, “including profile picture, cover photo, and initial posts” before Facebook “publicized the page.”</p>\n<p>He added that he has discussed honoraria being docked with other senators and Ho and he told them that he should receive a dock in honoraria “in order to be fair to the senators and student body.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also states that it will be followed by a bill to update A.S. Legal Code to require future Senates to create Facebook pages. Ornelas also plans to implement more structure for how often the pages should be updated and with what.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just interesting to look at maybe who’s updating what Facebook pages ‘cause I know that some just posted their office hours and they haven’t really done other things, but there’s senators that are really utilizing it to post direct resolutions that they’ve passed and kind of just giving updates,” Ornelas said.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think that some senators kind of just made [the Facebook page] to follow the [resolution],” he added. “Either because they don’t want to [update it] or they don’t think about it or because they don’t have anything to update it with.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor and Simren Verma is the university news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.
