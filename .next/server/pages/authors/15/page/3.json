When asked about Linden’s status as a student, university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the university was “prohibited by law and policy from discussing the specifics of this case.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fall 2019 was Linden’s first quarter at UCSB, according to student verification records. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linden was being held on a $150,000 bail at the Santa Barbara County Jail until his arraignment on Tuesday morning, when his charges were dropped to two misdemeanor charges of stalking and vandalism. His bail was also reduced to $2,500, which he posted, and he was subsequently released Tuesday evening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judicial officer in the case, Judge Clifford R. Anderson III, made Linden’s bail contingent on his compliance with a criminal protective order that was filed the same day, which orders Linden not to contact or come within 150 yards of Alexis. Alexis said she also requested a no-contact order through the Office of Student Conduct on campus on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, Alexis said she first met Linden on Tinder at the beginning of the school year and “hooked up” with him approximately three times over the course of a week and a half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t think it was a big deal, and [he] wasn’t even the only person I was seeing or anything like that,” she said. “After that, he was just kind of weird, and not really my type … so I just cut him off, like I just ghosted him, like you do in that situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when Linden’s behavior became unstable, and he began to send her threatening and vulgar messages, Alexis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’d be like, ‘Fuck you, you’re with another guy’ or something. And I was just like, okay, [I] blocked [him] on Snapchat, like that’s easy,” she said. “And then … he was on my Instagram, saying, ‘Why did you block me?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After blocking Linden on multiple platforms, Alexis said he then began texting her, asking her to come over, what she was doing and if he could come over to her place, she said. Initially, Alexis didn’t respond, but said she eventually told Linden: “Dude, I don’t feel the same way about you; I’m talking to someone else so, yeah, leave me alone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though she later blocked him on iMessage, Alexis said the block didn’t transfer over to her laptop, where he continued to harass her.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He sent me … like 25 texts, [a] message poem thing saying, ‘I like the way your eyes moved.’ Like ‘Oh my dear Alexis.’ Like really weird stuff,” she said. “This Friday, I was talking to my friend on FaceTime and I get this random FaceTime call …  and I answer it and it’s him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she immediately ended the call, but Linden kept calling and texting her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that point I was like, stop talking to me, you’re stalking me, I’m going to report it. And he was like, ‘Alright, do it, I don’t care. Tell the feds, I don’t care,’ just kind of making a joke about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that night, while Alexis was out of town, Linden allegedly came to her room in San Rafael Hall and starting loudly knocking on her suite’s door at around midnight, according to her roommates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had [either] cut himself prior — or was cutting himself then — and wrote his name in blood on my door,” Alexis said. “And then he was scratching his nails in my door, like his name and then my name.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, Alexis’ roommates found her name and his name written on the door together in a red substance that looked like blood; Alexis provided the Nexus with a picture of the door.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They sent me a picture ‘cause I was [out of town],” Alexis said. “I saw it and I automatically had a panic attack, like I was freaking out, I was shaking, I was crying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minutes after hearing what Linden had done, Alexis made a phone call to the UCSB Police Department to report what had happened. Linden was subsequently arrested with a warrant the next afternoon near the Santa Ynez apartments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis also spoke to a San Rafael resident assistant, Dallana Jimenez, who advised her through the next steps. Jimenez also reported the incident to San Rafael Assistant Resident Director Jesse Rodriguez, who later informed Alexis in an email that he had filed a Clery Act report and Title IX report, “as is required of [his] job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to a question about why the university had not sent out an alert to the student body when notified of the incident, Estrada said in an email that “</span><b>Timely Warnings</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are issued when certain crimes (see</span> <a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/sites/www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/clery-act-crime-definitions.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act Crime Definitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) that occurred on UCSB-associated property (see</span> <a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/sites/www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/clery-act-geography.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act Geography</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) are considered a serious or continuing threat to the campus community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The decision to issue a Timely Warning is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the facts surrounding the Clery Act crime, including, but not limited to, such factors as: the nature of the crime, the serious or continuing threat to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts,” Estrada said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days following Linden’s arrest, Alexis consulted the Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E) to learn more about the resources and services available to her in dealing with the aftermath of experiencing a stalker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she also consulted with Victims Advocates in the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s office, who aided her in working out the legal end of her situation. She also said the university had offered to move her into a different dorm, but that she declined the offer, telling the Nexus that it “doesn’t do anything — if he wanted to find me, he could.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis, who said she “almost didn’t go to the C.A.R.E office,” walked in after those close to her helped change her mind; she was immediately connected with an advocate to help talk her through her situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following her appointment, Alexis said her advocate was “super helpful,” encouraging her to explore all possible options and recommending that she take her situation to the attention of the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[C.A.R.E. staff] were all really, really friendly. [My advocate] was really helpful with me. She’s helping me get an attorney [and] do this whole process.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When consulting survivors involved in situations involving legal matters, C.A.R.E assumes the role of a “liaison,” providing them with the support to take their situation to the police or Title IX through “informed decisions” facilitated by C.A.R.E, according to C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The criminal justice system is really complicated … [and] the campus reporting system is pretty complicated,” which makes dealing with harassment and stalking particularly difficult, Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A major function of our role is that liaison role, especially around following up from these entities to get updates: ‘So what’s the status of this person’s case? What are the next steps? When can they expect to hear from you again?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s really where our expertise and understanding of trauma comes into play and being able to understand how processes … re-victimize and can re-traumatize. So sometimes C.A.R.E’s role is to promote and help things happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E operates on the basis of “services,” which Conway defines as “any interaction between a client and an advocate.” A service could be as simple as a short meeting, Conway said, or more extensive — such as going to accompany a survivor for “restraining order paperwork” or an interview at the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In respects to stalking, Conway said the “threat of fear” is a lot more common in survivors, especially in situations involving a high “volume” of harassment, which can be difficult to shake off when “peace and security” is all they want.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The elements that make stalking stick out a little bit differently than the other forms of violence that we serve is around the electronic component of it,” Conway said. “All they want is the behavior to stop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the pervasiveness of stalking through texting and social media, Conway said that it’s easy for people to feel violated when stalkers find a way to circumvent their boundaries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My whole family is obviously freaking the fuck out,” Alexis said. “I called my mom crying, like, can you imagine, can you imagine?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can you imagine your daughter calling you, telling you [that] someone wrote in blood on her door? Like a stalker? It’s crazy,” she said. “[My parents] were really scared, and they kind of want me to come home and it’s crazy that that’s even an option, like that’s what I have to do [to feel safe], go home.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The form also prompted them to answer the question, “What demands would you like to see be enacted on campus and in Isla Vista?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really want to make sure these demands are representative of what the student collective wants,” Ulloa said, adding that they would most likely release the demands in about a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of Thursday’s demonstration, the petition had received over 800 signatures, according to Diaz, who said they “don’t plan on closing [the petition] off anytime soon.” Despite not having a list of demands prepared at the Thursday protest, Diaz found “it’s better to get the input from the wider student populace before we finalize that list.”</span></p>\n<p><b>“</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because of the volume of feedback that we’ve gotten, especially from the Google Form, we definitely want to take an appropriate amount of time to really comb through that and really take the time to incorporate that into whatever list gets made,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dozens of students, some affiliated with participating organizations and some on their own, held up signs and talked to those walking through the Arbor about signing the petition through a QR code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For second-year student Hannah Ezell, the decision to sign the petition was a simple one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s just important for everyone to participate … it’s yes or no; it’s a pretty clear answer of what needs to be happening, so I did it without question,” Ezell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If getting involved in an organization isn’t for you, just talk to your friends about it and learn about what other people’s takes are on it. The more you know, I think the more you can grow and the more you can teach other people from what you have learned.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year economics major Devin Dohrmann also decided to join in solidarity, saying that he believed a misogynistic society is at fault for the recent events in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more male voices which you have, I feel, the more likely other men are to listen to you, because the people who are committing these rapes are already being conditioned by a really misogynistic society to not listen to women,” Dohrmann said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organizers also emphasized the importance of creating an activist coalition through the demonstration. Over 15 organizations signed up to collaborate with Intersectional Feminists, including campus resources such as Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) and student-led groups like Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For SASA, it was important to use the demonstration as a way to share resources that are available to survivors to help them navigate what they can do after being sexually assaulted, according to Francisco Trejo, a fourth-year biology major manning SASA’s table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Intersectional Feminists has taken the lead on putting together the demands, SASA has been figuring out “how much is actually feasible for the administration to implement,” Trejo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two weeks ago, SASA met with several administrators to discuss the university’s response to the latest allegations of sexual assault, according to Trejo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re always in the process of figuring out what more we can ask of [the university] to do for the student body and how we can more effectively communicate with them,” he added. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90929\" style=\"width: 1830px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img

Multipurpose Room of the Student Resource Building to address students’ concerns about the recent reports of sexual assault. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA is also partnering with C.A.R.E. to create a new prevention education curriculum, according to C.A.R.E.’s Assistant Director of Prevention Education Sven Rundman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been working with SASA to develop curriculum that we’re launching this year for all campus organizations … [and] also for Greek life as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planned Parenthood Generation Action, an on-campus organization that functions as a political arm of Planned Parenthood, was another student group that set up a table at Thursday’s demonstration with the intention of providing students with information about resources in the area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a survivor, I want to show the resources that helped me at Planned Parenthood when I needed that support,” said Megan Ashley, third-year vocal performance major who represented Planned Parenthood Generation Action at Thursday’s demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joan Hartmann, third district supervisor for Santa Barbara County and a representative of Isla Vista and UCSB, was originally only on campus to meet with Planned Parenthood Generation Action when she learned about the demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m here because I want to stand with survivors and highlight the importance of this issue,” Hartmann said. “This is unacceptable, and we really need to change people’s minds about what it means to be a man in our society.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann also applauded quick organization of the demonstration by Diaz, Ulloa and Youssef, and the large coalition of campus organizations that had come together in just a few days. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This really speaks to one, the organizational abilities of those who put this together and two, how serious everyone takes [allegations of sexual assault] on campus,” Hartmann said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann said she was also excited by the fact that the petition in circulation wasn’t just a set of demands, but an invitation for students to provide their input on what changes needed to be made. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the beginning of a discussion to pull together ideas,” she said. “I want to be part of the discussion, and I want to be part of the answer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt ‘19, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, noted that it seemed as if the university was back where it was several years ago, when students held a </span><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office with a list of demands to reform the way the university addressed sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The frustration is palpable, to still be here three years later,” he said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In between now and then, we’ve had the #MeToo movement, which has brought a lot of issues of sexual violence and harassment into the national context,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Echoing Hartmann’s points, Brandt applauded the efforts of the students who put together the demonstration and the efforts of those who have pushed for conversations about addressing sexual violence on campus and in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that what’s really important is that students are the ones who are leading this movement,” he said. “Students have come together and said ‘enough is enough’ before, and I think that’s what needs to happen again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the local politicians present at Thursday’s demonstration, several university administrators attended the event to show their support, including Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, and Katya Armistead, dean of student life, who co-signed an email sent to all UCSB students Wednesday night regarding the recent sexual assaults and university communications with students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took us a long time to get that statement out, and quite honestly, that hurts my heart,” Armistead said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the concerns she has heard from students were that the university hadn’t been communicating enough with students and that the administrators were planning on continuing to send emails to students explaining the situation and what the university was doing in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Student Affairs administration will be holding a town hall next Wednesday, Nov. 6, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Multipurpose Room of the Student Resource Building to address students’ concerns about the recent reports of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef emphasized that she hopes the conversation around sexual assault will continue with administrators after the demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is something we want to keep in discussion with UC admin and just keeping it in discussion from now on. This is just the start, and we want to keep doing things as well,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the demonstration can be seen <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/in-photos-protect-survivors-not-frats-students-hold-demonstration-following-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

But over the past 13 years, it has grown to become the Halloween hub of Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the myriad of costume-esque clothing and accessory options, Sweet Jane sells birthday supplies, festival clothes and Isla Vista-specific merchandise — like “U Can Study Buzzed” shot glasses and Isla Vista flags, various bongs and pipes and sunglasses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve never raised the prices on our sunglasses,” owner Stella Termin added, waving toward the towering display by the cash register. “They’ve always been buy-one-get-one.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Sweet Jane is known for its costume- and festival-ready inventory, students flock to the boutique at all times of the year, drawn in by the boutique’s unique Isla Vista college town vibes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I keep hearing it over and over again, ‘I love this store, I want everything in here,’ and it’s like yeah, this is the store where you want everything you don’t probably need,” Termin laughed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s just because [the store is] unusual.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having been a small business owner in I.V. for so long, Termin has seen how the culture of the college town has changed as students roll through it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, Termin said she sold a lot of clothes and jewelry with peace signs. “The kids were into revolution.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never bought anything in camo or anything, and all of a sudden they started having camouflage parties,” she said. “I can see that there’s a difference — there’s a big difference.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Termin attributes the change in culture in I.V. to the rise of social media, pointing to the Facebook event for Floatopia in 2009 that drew over 12,000 people to I.V.’s beaches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were actually on the sand; we were giving out water,” Termin said. “Let me tell you — I’ve never seen so many people on that beach.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took a half an hour just to get up and down the [beach] stairs; you couldn’t walk anywhere without stepping on a bottle or a can,” she added. “All the recycling people, the families, it was like their Black Friday.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Had that not been posted on Facebook, we could have maybe still had, at least for a few more years, some real Floatopia,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s kind of sad, ‘cause I see things change, you know, since when I first started.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just in the past few years, Termin has seen many I.V. businesses come and go — she named Firehouse Subs, Giovanni’s Pizza Restaurant and 212° Hotpot, which closed recently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that while some of the rent prices may seem doable at first sight, businesses have to consider the weeks or months during which students vacate Isla Vista, like over the summer or winter break. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not a continuum,” she said. “I’ve been lucky, knock on wood, because I was able to strategize and realize what I needed to do — I don’t know how — what I needed to do to be able to provide for what Isla Vista needed and wanted and to have fun.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90861\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/theres-no-place-quite-like-sweet-jane/sweet-jane-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-90861\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90861\" data-attachment-id=\"90861\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/theres-no-place-quite-like-sweet-jane/sweet-jane-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=2048%2C1362&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1362\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sweet jane 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90861\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alaska Yokota / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the high rents in Isla Vista, Termin added that there are a handful of licenses and taxes that she has to pay every year that make running a small business more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wish that they would give smaller businesses, especially those in seasonal, this type of environment, more tax breaks and more of tax initiatives, instead of pounding us over the head as businesses that make over half a million dollars a year,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Sweet Jane’s success, Termin said she thinks she has been around long enough to be able to maintain her level of business through word of mouth and the fact that most of her prices are cheaper than Amazon’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just think it’s being nice, treating your customers well, understanding what they need, put a smile on your face and be lucky,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweet Jane has rooted itself in the community, particularly through a handful of fun traditions. During the interview, Termin was ringing up students and noticed that one student was purchasing items for a birthday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Is it a birthday?” she asked. The student said yes, and Termin pulled out a box of buttons and stacks of cups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get to pick a birthday mug and free birthday button,” Termin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really?” the student said. “These are so cute!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s fun,” Termin said afterward. “They get excited, because birthdays are big deals, whether they’re yours or somebody else’s.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the birthday cup tradition, Sweet Jane creates new sticker designs every month that the store gives out for free. Another student at the register fawned over the newest design, telling Termin that she had all of the most recent ones and that they were her favorites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Termin lived at the far end of Trigo Road for a few years in the ‘90s with a then-boyfriend, it wasn’t until a friend brought her here in 2006 that she really saw Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just nice, over the years, to see the road the store has been on and the different people that have passed through here. So many students have worked here, and it’s great,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Sweet Jane is well loved, and that makes me very, very proud and happy. It means I did something right.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the October 31 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

and pat-downs outside of the Thunderdome</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of these discussions came the idea for a big Halloween concert, which Armistead said was completely student-run. Beyond providing security, portable toilets and parking, the university has no role in putting together the event; instead, members of the Associated Students Program Board (ASPB) spend months gathering booking data about artists, reaching out to their agents and narrowing down the list of potential performers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathaly Pacheco, special events coordinator for ASPB, fields requests from students and other board members about the genres of music or artists they want to see perform at the annual event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure we cater to what you guys want,” Pacheco said, emphasizing that events are funded by student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With board as a whole, no matter what we do, we have to think students are our number one priority.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past week, Pacheco and the rest of the ASPB staff have been working to ensure the show runs smoothly. On Saturday, Pacheco and the production coordinator will be starting their day at 7 a.m. to oversee the set up of all the production equipment, like the audio, lighting and any special equipment Program Board ordered at the artist’s request. They won’t go home until 2 a.m., when they wrap up clean-up for the show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco, who is going into her third year on Program Board, said her experience on the board in previous years has helped her work with other members more cohesively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I truly feel like you can’t be a good leader unless you know what the other people that are working for you are doing,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this year’s show, and her time on Program Board as a whole, Pacheco said it was important to her to bring a diverse lineup to campus; she pointed out that UCSB has never had a female headliner perform at any of their shows. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a big problem, even within the industry; it’s like such an issue of seeing powerful women or seeing women being represented in this specific industry,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco said Program Board was actually in touch with Megan Thee Stallion to bring her for Delirium but said the timing didn’t work out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Leikeli47, one of the supporting acts at this year’s Delirium, Pacheco said the board tries its best to “bring and showcase diversity when it comes to the artists that we bring to the campus and stay on the wave of artists that we think are only going to keep growing and growing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really, really want to make sure that we do that this year,” she said. “I know that we have a really big Latinx community here at this school — it’s the second biggest demographic — but we don’t cater to Spanish music or other different genres of music.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiyomi Morrison, program board commissioner, emphasized Pacheco’s sentiments about wanting to invite more student input to Program Board’s internal processes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d like [students] to meet the Program Board people, and then also make our office hours available so they can come in at any time, talk to anyone, not only for talking about the programs that we do, but if they need help doing events or if they are interested in working or volunteering with us,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Morrison pointed to the Associated Students’ Finance and Business Committee’s public posts last year that documented where student fees were going and said that was something she was interested in implementing, particularly because Program Board has a high lock-in fee, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Program Board is working with a budget of $1,110,106.25 for the 2019-2020 academic year, according to a budget presented by last year’s commissioner, Ryanne Ross, at the end of last year. While a lot of the budget goes toward the larger special events, Program Board also puts on regular Free Tuesday Films, Storke Tower shows, shows in the Hub, lectures and other events throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the money that Program Board makes from charging for smaller events goes toward subsidizing costs for larger events, Morrison added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to events like Delirium, Morrison and Pacheco said the safety of students is of the utmost priority to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We throw a lot of big festivals where a lot of people are drunk and that kind of stuff, and also, police are required to be there,” Morrison said. “We’re on the student side … we are here for you guys and we want to make sure you are safe, first and foremost.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco said police presence at this year’s show is expected to be the same as previous years, and that students can expect metal detectors and pat-downs outside of the Thunderdome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know that Halloween here is pretty dead, and it’s just like, people go home, people decide to go to other places,” Pacheco said. “This is one of the things that people can do in a fun and safe way.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Levine, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-23/galoustian-files-motion-in-court-requesting-ucpd-internal-documents-alleging-violation-of-due-process-in-his-arrest-and-investigation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented a Pitchess motion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is used in instances when a defendant wants to request information from a police officer’s personnel file. The motion was originally filed with the court on Oct. 3, 2019. Levine’s motion resulted in the trial being pushed back to January 2020; it was initially scheduled to begin on Dec. 4, 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine was particularly interested in investigating Officer Ryan Hashimoto, who allegedly circulated a video “of an alleged sexual assault that was evidence in [Galoustian’s] case” and was an initial investigator in Galoustian’s case, which began in December 2017, when he was first arrested. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This incident was detailed in a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed against the UC Santa Barbara Police Department in March, in which Officer Ryan Smith, who is referred to as John Doe in court documents, alleged widespread racism, misconduct and conspiracy within the department.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alison Bernal, an attorney for the Regents of the University of California, and Lieutenant Robert Romero of UCPD, appeared as representatives of the department at the Wednesday afternoon court appearance. The two confirmed to Judge James Herman that an internal affairs investigation had just been opened against Hashimoto and that it would take approximately six months for it to conclude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herman ruled against Levine’s motion, which named multiple officers — Hashimoto, Officers Michael Little and Tiffany Little and Lieutenant Mark Signa — who Bernal, Romero and Karapetian confirmed were not involved in the case, but still granted Levine the additional time to investigate Hashimoto independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herman initially considered pushing the trial back a full six months to allow Levine access to the internal affairs findings, but Karapetian, who is also a senior deputy district attorney for Santa Barbara County, pressed the judge to consider the victims, who she said were “eager” and “anxious” to get the trial over with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would be in strong opposition to any continuance of this case,” Karapetian said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine, who expressed frustration that he first learned about the civil suit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/09/whistleblower-lawsuits-blow-lid-off-ucsb-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> newspaper articles, argued that the defense needed time to conduct its own investigation, particularly since Levine was without the resources and results of the internal affairs investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawyers for the University of California Board of Regents, including Bernal, filed an opposing motion on Oct. 18, arguing that because many of the officers named in the motion were not involved in Galoustian’s investigation or arrest, Herman should exclude them from his decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Herman emphasized that the defendant had a right to “exculpatory” information — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">evidence that clears the defendant from guilt in a criminal trial — which</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could arise from an investigation of Hashimoto. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine also said the defense would be interested in calling Hashimoto as a key witness for the trial, even as Karapetian stressed to the judge that the prosecution would not be calling him or using his statements because of the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian, who is currently facing 33 felony charges on behalf of two victims, was brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair wearing a large brace on his right leg at the Wednesday afternoon court appearance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Levine, Galoustian has been “very ill” and received medical treatment. Levine did not comment further on Galoustian’s condition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trial is currently scheduled to begin on Jan. 8, 2020 and is expected to take approximately 15 court days. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Oct. 24, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

community and those who are supporting it,” Leets said.  Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The list was first debuted last year, after Craig Leets, current director of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), was hired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Dr. Nathaniel Burke, who’s the coordinator of equity and inclusion for the Division of Student Affairs, wanted to do an Out List and mentioned that to me as I was interviewing for this position, actually, and one of the things they were looking for in a new director was someone who had done an Out List before,” said Leets, who managed an Out List at Portland State University for several years before he started at UCSB last fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the list is to create a “visual representation of the community and those who are supporting it,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In many ways, LGBTQ identities are invisible, right?” he said. “We can’t look at someone and know they are LGBTQ, and so LGBTQ people look around them on a campus and they don’t know who else is LGBTQ and don’t know who’s supportive or welcoming to LGBTQ people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing those folks publicly acknowledging themselves as LGBTQ or as supporters can be really powerful for a student to feel like they’re not the only LGBTQ in their class, in their department or on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this year’s list will be launched on Friday, Leets updates the list on a rolling basis even after the deadline for sign-ups passes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, 471 students, staff and faculty signed up for the 2018 Out List over the course of the year; as of Tuesday afternoon, the 2019 Out List was at 494 sign-ups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really excited that this early in the year … we’ve already exceeded that number from last year, but my hope is that we’ll get a few more and be able to get above 500 for when we release the list on Friday,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leets emphasized that the list is not meant to be an “all-encompassing” list of LGBTQ individuals on the campus, particularly since there are many people who cannot be out publicly, either for personal or professional reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Leets acknowledged that there was the potential that the list could be used for “nefarious” reasons, he also said that anyone who signed up for the list was reminded during the sign-up process that they weren’t obligated to include any information they didn’t feel comfortable being publicly available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s one of those things that it’s impactful for the people who need it, but for people who don’t, I’m not sure they know it exists,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephenson Brooks Whitestone, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Communication who was on the Out List last year, emphasized the importance of such a resource to combat the “the alienation and isolation that many queer students feel — from the families, from their classmates, even from childhood friends,” she said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Out List] is [a] tangible symbol of queer people living their lives openly and honestly,” Whitestone added. “The knowledge that queer people live, survive and thrive here at UCSB is both comforting and empowering.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whitestone said that no students have reached out to her specifically because she’s on the list, but said she still likes “having [her] name on the list, and in a sense, adding to the length of the list.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whitestone noted that visibility can be a “tricky issue in the queer community” due to pressure to come out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But no one should become visible if they do not feel safe — physically or emotionally — to do so. Safety comes first. Opportunities for safe “out” living will come later. There’s never any need to put oneself at risk,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Alan Fridlund in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who signed up for the Out List in 2018, said he discusses LGBTQ issues in class often, either in scientific or personal contexts, and discloses his own sexual orientation during these discussions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students have described relief at being able to talk freely with someone both familiar with the science and has also navigated a personal “coming out” journey,” Fridlund said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Movies and TV are making LGBT characters trendy, and the old stigmas about being LGBT are diminishing,” Fridlund added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are still a number of students who come from families that view being LGBTQ “as sin, moral defect or mental illness,” he noted. This is where the Out List can come into play, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For these students especially, some of whom may be conflicted about their own LGBT inclinations, it’s important to understand that LGBT people </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like their non-LGBT counterparts </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are just normal everyday folks.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

professionals. </span><em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for students who have never had access to mental health resources before, whether it’s for financial, cultural or other reasons, Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) can be a student’s first foray into addressing mental health issues — a vital first step that, for some, can be a lifesaver. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hilary Ochoa, a fourth-year Chicano studies major, just marked her first full year of C.A.P.S. counseling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had always wanted to go [to counseling],” Ochoa said. “I feel like I had a lot of things from my childhood that I wanted to talk about. My home life was never the best, and I struggled with anxiety in high school.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa went to C.A.P.S. for the first time during her second year of college, after being referred by Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.). Her first experience with a therapist, however, wasn’t what she had wanted it to be — namely because Ochoa felt like her therapist, a white woman, didn’t understand her and her experiences as a Mexican woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I couldn’t relate to her at all,” Ochoa said. “I found that now that I [have] found a different therapist that I really needed somebody who understood my background.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa didn’t return to C.A.P.S. until the beginning of last summer, after a quarter of academic troubles and the looming threat of academic disqualification. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Ochoa, “going home [wasn’t] an option,” so she decided to spend the summer in Isla Vista and work while she figured out her next steps; during that time, she heard about a new therapist at C.A.P.S., Jessica Adams, who Ochoa said was Puerto Rican and spoke Spanish. She decided to give C.A.P.S. a second chance and booked an appointment with Adams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like she listened and I felt like she was actually helping me and I felt like I was getting the help that I needed,” Ochoa said. “And that was from the first time that I met her.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa noted that Adams was able to “catch onto things that [she] hadn’t told her yet,” which reassured her that her new therapist was a good fit for her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Ochoa said she spent her sessions learning to cope with her anxiety and to notice when her depression was getting worse. It’s a victory for Ochoa that she now goes to sessions every few weeks, versus her weekly appointments when she first started out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Adams] has given me a lot of tools to kind of focus and cope with things on my own to get myself out of certain ruts,” Ochoa said, adding that she sees herself continuing counseling after she graduates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the reason Ochoa had the opportunity to access therapy was because she was on a college campus, she emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Talking about mental health] was honestly something new to me,” Ochoa said. “My mom didn’t really talk about that, she was just like, ‘Oh, no you aren’t depressed, you’re just lazy,’ ‘What do you even have to be depressed about,’ or I don’t even think she knows what anxiety is, still.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She comes from Mexico, and it’s a hard thing to talk about… And it’s so easy for her to dismiss mental health.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several other students who spoke about their experience seeking mental health help noted that it was the combination of stigma within their families in addition to the financial burden that prevented them from seeking help before they went to college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tatum Katz, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Ecology, Evolution &amp; Marine Biology, first went to therapy as an undergraduate at Occidental College in Los Angeles. At home, her parents didn’t believe in mental illness and she didn’t have insurance, so “it was just not a possibility” for her to get help.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Katz, seeking therapy at Occidental was “more of a reaction to a crisis, and a lack of understanding of myself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She’s continued counseling while at UCSB and now describes mental health as “something that I need to do and need to stay on top of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if people feel like their mental health is fine, Katz recommends that everyone see mental health professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get a physical every year, you get your blood work, you get your shots or whatever, you should do that with your mental health,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But C.A.P.S. doesn’t have to be just for students with long-term mental health problems — for some, C.A.P.S. has helped those who run into crises during their college years, such as Marisol Gonzalez, a fourth-year linguistics major who first went to C.A.P.S. after her close family member had a stroke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was her first time seeking mental health resources and while she doesn’t see herself continuing therapy after college, she said she was glad to be able to take advantage of the resource during the distressing time period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t able to focus on school or just anything. I tried going to class, but I just ended up crying all over campus, and I was just a mess,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While interviewees recommended that incoming students try C.A.P.S., many acknowledged how difficult it can be to get appointments and how that may impact students who are asking for help for the first time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. Director Brian Olowude said that the office had recently hired a handful of psychologists and were “constantly looking at [their] available hours” in order to meet student demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that while staff had increased by 50% over the last five years, “initial contacts” with students had increased 127%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. is currently working on developing its first-ever annual report, set to be released in the next month or so, which will include information about how many people the office had seen in the past year and what services were provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude said that about 16% of the campus uses C.A.P.S.’s services, compared to the six to 13% of college students who use mental health services on college campuses nationally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say confidently that access to mental health services at UCSB will probably outpace [students’] access in the community when they leave here,” Olowude added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to offering short-term counseling services in their offices, C.A.P.S. also provides community referrals for long-term counseling options in the community — one of which is Acacia Counseling, a clinic in Isla Vista that was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/acacia-counseling-wellness-supports-ucsb-students-mental-health/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solely to provide accessible long-term counseling options for UCSB students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main areas that Acacia Counseling specializes in is helping students through the development of their identities through formative college years, which is why it’s important for them to staff their offices with clinicians who reflect the population they serve, Kristen Strong, director of the center, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude also emphasized that, as UCSB is a “minority-serving institution,” it’s important for C.A.P.S. psychologists to be reflective of their diverse clientele. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude and Strong both emphasized that students should take their time finding the right therapists for themselves, and that the first therapist they see may not always be the right fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You might not fit culturally, you might not fit personality-wise, and that’s not anything necessarily bad,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa echoed Strong and Olowude’s sentiments about putting in the effort to find the right therapist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially for people of color, I would really suggest to try to find somebody who you can relate to, who looks like you,” she said. “A lot of my mental health issues came from my childhood and growing up… so people not understanding the cultural aspect of a person, I feel impedes you getting the best help that you can get.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

However, the two acknowledged that some may “see our action as born of political pressure, or as green movement idealism or perhaps political correctness run amok.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So be it,” the two said in the op-ed. “We are part of a university system where diversity of opinion thrives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have chosen to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a better planet, and reap the financial rewards for UC, rather than simply </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a headline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But several activists at UCSB, including some of those who were present at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/chancellor-yang-agrees-to-endorse-3-billion-uc-divestment-from-fossil-fuels-after-72-hour-sit-in/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">72-hour protest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> held in Cheadle Hall in 2017 by Fossil Free UCSB, said the UC’s decision to divest stemmed from years of student and faculty activism across the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, they believed a recent vote held by the UC Academic Senates, which found 77% of senate members wished to divest from fossil fuels, was a leading factor as opposed to financial reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Ph.D. student Emily Williams, one of the founders of Fossil Free UC and a part of the Cheadle Hall protest, said she was “speechless and overwhelmed” at the news but denounced the claim that the decision was done for “purely for financial reasons.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have to say that,” Williams said bluntly, explaining that she believes if the UC said they had divested from fossil fuels for moral reasons rather than financial reasons, there would be “mounting pressure” to divest from other movements like the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams noted that Bachher and Sherman’s argument that fossil fuel investments are risky is something that the Fossil Free UC movement has been arguing since its inception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Them making that decision was really the result of years of students and faculty and alums, finally chancellors getting on board, really advocating for this,” she said. “They wouldn’t necessarily have even given this a look had the campaign not have advocated for it so strongly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several other UCSB climate activists — Ph.D. global studies student Theo LeQuesne, fourth-year political science major Cassie Macy and sociology professor John Foran — echoed Williams’ opinions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m just happy to come to some closure on this, it’s been a fantastic movement,” Foran said. “It should not have taken, of course, six years. We’re not delighted by the reasoning given by the Regents, that it’s [a] purely economic decision, we think that’s kind of not true.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t acknowledge the fact that there was a movement demanding it, without which we wouldn’t be here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UC was founded by students across the UC system in 2012. For the past several years, the group has held demonstrations at campuses including </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2016/05/06/uc-berkeley-students-and-alumni-stage-sit-in-at-uc-office-of-the-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and UCSB, all to encourage the Regents to divest from fossil fuels – but LeQuesne emphasized that it has been a long path to victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We started off kind of really taking the UC Regents as equals and [we were] really interested in trying to work with them,” LeQuesne said. “But about a year or two into that process, it because pretty clear that the UC Regents were not particularly interested in actually making this going forward.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that around 2015, the group changed its strategy, moving toward “mobilizing the community approach.” They decided to get “more disruptive,” he said – “a more disruptive kind of movement, build approach necessary to really get the Regents to pay attention to us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group organized across UC campuses, campaigning to get all student governments to endorse the divestment and organizing sit-ins. LeQuesne emphasized that one of the movement’s biggest successes was the 2017 Cheadle Hall sit-in, during which over 100 students sat in Cheadle Hall for over 72 hours until Chancellor Yang agreed to endorse students’ demands for fossil fuel divestment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams, who was present at the sit-in, said it was “powerful” to be there in that moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a bit of nervousness because what you’re ultimately doing is civil disobedience,” she emphasized. “You’re doing something that is against the rules, but you’re doing it because you have so much respect for the institution and for the cause that you’re working on that you really feel like you need to take a step and do something, draw attention to it and make a change.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While climate activists at UCSB were happy to finally see the Regents take tangible action for climate justice, Foran said divesting from fossil fuels is only the first step for the UC in the “overarching global climate justice movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a small step in a long journey,” Foran said. “We’re up against the most powerful corporations in the history of the world and the governments they control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But today is a good day in that struggle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Macy, who was a first-year student during the 2017 sit-in and is now entering her last year at UCSB, her next steps are to ensure the UC “follow[s] their promises and fully divest,” but she’s also working on refilling the ranks now that many climate activists have graduated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next steps are finding some people who can take the place of them and take the place of me in the future and just keep fighting for this environmental change,” Macy said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foran and Williams also pointed to the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/in-photos-11-minutes-for-11-years-youth-climate-strike-takes-over-arbor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunrise Movement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the next generation of climate activism at UCSB, and Williams referenced the </span><a href=\"https://globalclimatestrike.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">global climate strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scheduled for Sept. 20-27. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[This is] for the fate of the planet.

been advocating for this initiative for several years now, starting with former RCSGD director Dolan. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can indicate their pronouns in Gaucho On-Line Data (G.O.L.D.); in the “About Me” section, students can select from he/him/his, she/her/hers, they/them/theirs, ze/hir/hirs, “I do not use a pronoun,” “Other, please ask,” “I use all gender pronouns” or “None (will not display).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pronouns will be visible to all course instructors through Gauchospace and eGrades, with the goal of reducing misgendering for transgender and nonbinary students in classroom settings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Sept. 17, about 1,000 students had indicated their pronouns through G.O.L.D., according to Craig Leets, director of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If a trans or nonbinary student is going to a class that they know that they’re gonna get misgendered in, not only are they less focused on the material, maybe less willing to go to that course, but there’s a stress associated with that,” Leets said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a significant negative impact on our students who are experiencing this regular misgendering in their classes, and so it was really important for us to try and lessen that and this is one of the best ways that we could do that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD and the Trans Task Force have been advocating for this initiative for several years now, starting with former RCSGD director Dolan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leets, who started as the center’s new director last year, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/new-rcsgd-director-hopes-to-help-rebuild-center/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spoke</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> almost a full year ago about the initiative. Over the past year, the center has been laying the groundwork for the implementation of pronouns, looking into what departments would be involved with the change and how much work it would take, Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was earlier this year that we got the approval from the university to move forward, and so this summer has really been when the bulk of the work has been happening,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Office of the Registrar, the Division of Student Affairs and Student Information Systems &amp; Technology have been working on the technical end to change the university systems to accommodate pronouns, while Leets has been working on the marketing side of the project; news of the change was first announced in a campus-wide email sent out on Sept. 12 by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the initiative has been implemented at two other UC campuses already, Leets said the biggest hurdle in implementing pronoun functionality has been working around the lack of guidance from the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB – and this is [applicable to] a lot of topics – worries that they will do something and then later the Office of the President will come and say ‘Well, we want you to do it differently,’ and so that will require us to do a lot of extra work to change what we’ve already been doing to respond to what the Office of the President wants,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB intentionally modeled the pronoun options after UCSF’s systems, Leets said, with the idea that if the UC Office of the President (UCOP) decides to start collecting this data, UCOP can recommend that other schools follow UCSB and UCSF’s methods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this implementation is a victory for the RCSGD, Leets said it was only the first step in making the university more inclusive for everyone. The pronoun functionality is only currently available for students, but the ultimate goal is to allow people to choose pronouns through the Campus Directory rather than G.O.L.D., he added, which would allow for staff and faculty members to also indicate their pronouns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, all UCSB students, staff and employees can indicate their preferred name on the directory; Leets said the center is still working out whether or not pronouns will be publicly available or just visible to people affiliated with UCSB, noting that there may be students who would be opposed to having their pronouns publicly available.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Eventually, we would want this data to be as accessible as someone’s name, because names and pronouns are used all the time, by everyone,” he said. “However, as we’re still exploring the impacts on campus for having access to people’s pronouns, we’ll have to decide if everything’s going super well and we can release it in a public way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next big date for pronoun functionality is Sept. 20, when GauchoSpace will update to include pronouns. Leets added that said the center will have a meeting in mid-October to discuss the timeline for transitioning pronoun functionality to the Campus Directory, but noted that it would be at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year at the earliest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD also plans to use the upcoming International Pronouns Day on Oct. 16 as a way to spread the word about the pronoun functionality, such as through tabling in the Arbor. The center also plans to continue to market it during events throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just gonna keep telling people about it –– we wanna get all students, and as many students as possible, to indicate their pronouns,” Leets said. “That’s something that I would really emphasize, is that it’s for all students… It’s not just for trans and nonbinary students. Those students might be the most impacted, hopefully positively by this new functionality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want all students to indicate what their pronouns are to reduce the amount of assuming we do for other people’s pronouns, because we can be wrong when we make those assumptions.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [4:30 p.m.]: GauchoSpace will be updated on Sept. 20, not Sept. 19, as the article originally stated.</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated [5:35 p.m.]: This story has been updated to reflect Dolan’s preferred name. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
