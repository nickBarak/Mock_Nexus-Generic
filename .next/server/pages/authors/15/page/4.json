CSD pictured at the first meeting. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that first meeting, I really remember the feeling of the weight of 50 years of activism on our shoulders,” Bertrand said. “People had fought for this for so long, and there had been so many efforts and so much love for this community that went into this long-term movement to create a local government.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inaugural board was composed of seven members: Bertrand, Vice President Natalie Jordan, Secretary Brandt and Directors Jay Freeman, Robert Geis, Father Jon Hedges and George Thurlow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the board’s seven members, five are elected. The other two seats are appointed by UCSB and Santa Barbara County to represent their respective interests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the district first formed, Bertrand was a student at Santa Barbara City College, while Brandt ‘19 and Jordan ‘18 were students at UCSB. Two long-term I.V. residents, entrepreneur Jay Freeman ‘03 and local reverend Father Jon Hedges, also won elected seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geis, a retired county official, and Thurlow ‘73, a university administrator, hold the appointed positions. Both are long-term Santa Barbara residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand and Brandt both said the different generations represented on the board, specifically the “diversity of viewpoints,” formed a more cohesive board, with Brandt pointing specifically to Geis’ years of previous experience in local government as an advantage the board would not have had otherwise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the big disadvantages of being young in local government spaces, which are predominantly older and whiter and more traditional, is that you don’t really have the context for a lot of things and why certain things are set up the way that they are and how to best go about things to achieve the outcome that you want,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Abboud ‘14, former Associated Students President and SBCC Board Trustee, took over as the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-11/community-services-district-hires-jonathan-abboud-as-interim-general-manager/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">district’s interim general manager</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2017 and as the permanent general manager in December 2018. The position of interim general manager was created to account for the district’s unexpectedly small budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-13/i-v-csd-shakes-up-board-leadership/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succeeded Bertrand as president in December</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; Jordan </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/term-in-review-i-v-csd-vice-president-natalie-jordan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has since left</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was replaced by new director Kristie Nguyen; Geis is now vice president, and the secretary position was eliminated. </span></p>\n<p><b>FUNDING: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district faced several crippling impediments at its formation, but none more so than one that loomed for nearly two years after its creation: a lack of funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board theoretically had the power to implement programs and make changes around I.V., it didn’t have the funding to do so. An eight percent utility tax on I.V. residents </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed in the 2016 election, with only 62% of residents voting yes.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It needed 66.66% of the vote to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Darcél Elliott had managed the campaigns for both the district and its accompanying tax. When the district passed but the funding failed, Elliott pointed to campaigns by I.V. property owners who had vocally opposed the tax.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In this election, fear won over hope,” Elliott said on election night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district’s funds would come from a yearly $200,000 grant from UCSB, but the money could only be spent on services the university agreed were useful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if the district failed to secure a tax by 2023, it would cease to exist, a deadline that haunted the newly formed district. So when the board placed a new tax on the June 2018 ballot, local campaigners ramped up their efforts to win voter approval. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-83520\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of the “Vote Yes on Measure R” campaign celebrate after learning of the passing of the tax. (Pictured left to right: Ethan Bertrand, Emily Murray, Spencer Brandt and Jonathan Abboud.) <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 80% of Isla Vistans would vote to provide the district funding through </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure R</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a measure that was nearly identical to its failed predecessor, Measure F. Measure R promised improvements to parking, public safety, lighting and sidewalks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75% vs. 17.25%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eight percent tax has brought an influx of cash into the district. The district ended its 2018-2019 fiscal year with nearly half a million in spending compared to over $800,000 in income – a far cry from what it started out with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the next fiscal year, the district </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-19/i-v-csd-budget-sees-about-200000-increase-in-funding-for-next-fiscal-year/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expects a $200,000 increase in funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rounding up to more than $1 million, according to numbers released by the district in May. </span></p>\n<p><b>THE CSD’S FIRST SERVICES: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without consistent revenue, the district spent its first year setting up as many services as possible with its limited resources, which involved “lots of strong partnerships with other government agencies and non-profit service providers,” Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board’s first project was expanding community policing efforts. Community Service Organization (CSO) safety officers have always escorted students home on weekend nights, but the district worked with UCSB to set up in-person stations at streetside locations for students to seek help.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSOs — who almost always are UCSB students themselves — worked over 3,000 hours and provided over 300 escorts during the last academic year, according to numbers released in July. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re there not to enforce, but to help people, to give out water, to help people charge their phones, to give people an escort home and when there is a safety concern, they’re there to call it into the police,” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD has also focused on sexual violence-related issues, hiring the first </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpersonal violence investigator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to work within the UCPD and partnering with Standing Together Against Sexual Assault (STESA) to set up a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the district’s most recent initiatives is a community-led beautification program, where I.V. residents can report graffiti, trash, vandalism or lighting issues to the district. The district will then either send out workers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">houseless community members they hired to tackle these issues </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or forward the requests to the county if necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community,” Brandt said at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">program’s launch</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April.</span></p>\n<p><b>WHERE THE CSD HAS STRUGGLED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The directors have acknowledged that the board, in its first iteration, struggled to reflect the demographics of I.V.’s population – six of the seven board members are male, and Bertrand was the only person of color on the board until Nguyen replaced Jordan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen is still the only woman on the board, and Bertrand is the only member that identifies as LGBTQ+. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I say this as a straight white guy – it’s a huge problem that it’s only people who look like me who feel most empowered to get involved in local government,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We benefit so much from the perspective and the leadership of women and people of color, and it is really something that we, speaking for myself and for all of us, really try to encourage the next generation of leaders to reflect that and would like to see a more diverse board in the future.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand emphasized that the board did vote a “gay man of color” as its first president and a woman as its vice president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district has also stalled on its promise of a low-income exception to the tax, which it campaigned on ahead of the June 2018 election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last fall, more than four months after the tax had passed, the directors were still split on whether or not to implement the exemption, with some directors arguing that residents could expose loopholes to avoid the tax. The board has still not addressed implementing the promised exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9, 2018 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, the district has also failed to substantively address the issue of parking in I.V. — an issue it was formed to tackle. Parking in I.V. remains one of the biggest downsides to living in the tightly-packed neighborhood, with limited parking attached to houses and even fewer open spots available on the street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street parking in I.V. can also be dangerous; numerous students have posted on social media about windows being smashed and mirrors removed by drunk cyclists or a baseball bat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During larger events like Deltopia or Halloween, the university actively encourages students to purchase parking passes to move their cars out of I.V. and remove valuables from their cars. </span></p>\n<p><b>“</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the broader parking issue, I think that’s been one of those issues where everyone has made it very clear to us that it’s a difficult problem to solve, and that if we’re gonna do anything on it, we need to have the internal staff capacity to be able to put something together that actually works,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the future, we really need to have a professional come in and assess the situation and make some strong recommendations.” </span></p>\n<p><b>WHAT COMES NEXT?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD is tackling what is probably its biggest project yet – the revival of the Isla Vista Community Center (IVCC), a center that many I.V. residents thought would never exist.

id=\"caption-attachment-88786\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Santa Barbara County Court has reversed three UCSB Title IX decisions in the last year, noting a lack of due process in the Title IX process in each case. <em>Nexus File Photo </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student, referred to in court documents as John Doe, is suing on his own behalf as well as on behalf of all other UC students who were disciplined under several different sexual harassment and sexual violence policies ranging from 2015 to 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policies, according to the lawsuit, include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2015 Interim Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence, implemented on 6/17/2015</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California PACAOS-Appendix-E: Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Student Adjudication Framework, implemented on 1/1/2016</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy, implemented on 1/1/2016 </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Interim Appendix E – Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH) Student Adjudication Framework, implemented on 3/1/2019</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All local University of California campus procedures modeled after the aforementioned system-wide policies</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that the UC Regents uses an investigation model that has been found unlawful in previous court cases, referencing the January 2019 case </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the case, the court ruled that students accused of sexual misconduct in cases where the credibility of witness reports are central to the claim must be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses — either directly or indirectly and in person or through a method like videoconferencing, in front of a neutral judge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the UC’s investigation model, the responsibility for the investigation falls to “a single [Title IX investigator] who acted as police, prosecutor, jury, and judge without a live, in-person hearing before impartial adjudicators where the accused could question or cross-examine the complainant and witnesses,” the suit alleges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC changed its adjudication process in March 2019 after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ruling to comply with the live hearing requirement. On July 31, the UC unveiled a more comprehensive guide to the hearing process, one that is “fair, treats parties with respect and compassion, and results in just and reliable outcomes,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/title-ix/resources/student-adjudication-framework/interim-svhs-student-adjudication-framework-ppt.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July SVSH Student Investigation and Adjudication Framework</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe’s suit represents those who were disciplined under the policies before the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ruling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe’s specific Title IX case began in February 2017, court documents say, when UCLA’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity received a report that Doe had allegedly sexually harassed and stalked another student on multiple occasions between September 2016 and February 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit says Doe cooperated with the school, “meeting with the Title IX investigator several times and providing documents to support his defense that the allegations against him were entirely false.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe alleges that he asked for access to the evidence collected by the investigator but had his requests denied by both the investigator and UCLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that while the investigation “disclosed no direct evidence” of either stalking or sexual harassment, the Title IX investigator concluded there was a “preponderance of evidence” that Doe had engaged in sexual harassment and stalking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCLA Student Conduct Officer then confirmed the Title IX investigator’s findings and suspended Doe for two years. Doe appealed the decision and had his suspension reduced to one year after the appeal body found him responsible of sexual harassment but not stalking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe once again appealed the decision, arguing that “the finding was made in the absence of evidence supporting the elements of sexual harassment in the Policy and the application of a minimum one-year suspension for ‘other sexual contact’ in the absence of any contact whatsoever was improper.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His suspension was reduced to three months, but he was required to reapply to UCLA and “submit documentation of his ability to be a student ‘without engaging in any behavior that would violate university policy.’” He would also be placed on disciplinary probation for the rest of his time at UCLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second proposed class member in the lawsuit, John Doe2, was a graduate student at an unnamed UC campus in 2016 when he was notified in March that the campus’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity had been notified of research misconduct and stalking allegations against him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 was ordered to stay 100 yards from the graduate student he allegedly harassed, and he was restricted from his research. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to Doe’s case, Doe2 alleges that he cooperated with the investigation and provided evidence that proved the allegations against him false, and was also not allowed to see other evidence collected by the investigator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that the investigation “disclosed no direct evidence” of stalking, computer hacking or that “any online accounts were compromised or hacked,” but Doe2 was found guilty of stalking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 says in the suit that there were 113 exhibits of evidence that were not provided to him and 40 unidentified witnesses who were not named, even though he repeatedly requested the evidence and the witness statements, including through the California Public Records Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 was suspended for two years, but he appealed the decision and had his suspension reduced to one year after the appeal body decided he was not responsible for violating the stalking and sexual violence policies, only the physical abuse policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 appealed the decision once again but had his appeal denied. He then filed a writ to “set aside the improper administrative finding that [he] is responsible for a violation of Conduct Policy 102.08 and the one-year suspension.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court ruled in Doe2’s favor, and the university started a new Title IX investigation in December 2018. Doe2 alleges there has been no action from the university since then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC spokesperson Claire Doan said they had not been served with the lawsuit and had no comment at this time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariana Alvarez, Title IX director at UCSB, said she believed the Title IX process offered students due process and declined to comment on the case specifically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Court has reversed three UC Santa Barbara Title IX decisions in the last year, noting a lack of due process in the Title IX process in each case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Judge Donna D. Geck agreed with the student’s claim that UCSB’s internal policies were “Confusing, Internally Inconsistent, and Unfair,” and ruled that the UC Regents failed to provide the student with a fair hearing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/sb-superior-court-reverses-ucsb-students-suspension-for-sexual-assault/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Geck again called attention to the Title IX process, writing in the decision that in the university’s hearing, “Noticeably absent was even a semblance of due process.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the accused does not receive a fair hearing, neither does the accuser,” Geck added in court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucsb-student-exonerated-from-relationship-violence-charges-after-629-days/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Judge Thomas P. Anderle found that the school predetermined the student’s guilt, thus violating the due process requirements of the federal and state constitutions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of making that decision based upon facts, the law, and in fairness, [UCSB] has decided to do it their own way,” Anderle wrote in court documents.</span></p>\n<p>The full lawsuit can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190802-Amended-Petition.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [8/9]: This article has been updated to include a link to the full lawsuit.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

be. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Coffee Company; Sam and Luke’s, named for their kids; or Moose, for their dog, were were a few of the names they pitched to their friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But ultimately, they settled on Campus Point Coffee, a nod to the beach by the UC Santa Barbara Chi-5 freshmen dorms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more we came up with names and bounced them off our friends, Campus Point just kind of stuck. We really felt like we wanted something that identified with the local town,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You could name it anything; I bet you there’s probably a randomizer on Google that will give you different names. But we wanted to come up with something that was kind of a flag post saying, ‘We’re a part of this community.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson, who grew up in Santa Barbara and graduated from UCSB in 2001, said he had always been interested in owning “something in Isla Vista.” When he saw the location was available, he said he knew he had to go for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This [space] was a big part of my life when I was at UCSB when I was here, and it’s such a great spot,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson’s vision for Campus Point Coffee is simple: He wants Isla Vistans to use the space as a place to come together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson referenced Java Jones, which occupied the space before Coffee Collaborative, and how the shop fostered a feeling of community — one he wishes to replicate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Back in the late ‘90s, early 2000s … [there] were places in I.V. that were just like the space where your crew met. It was either Java Jones, or I.V BC, which was Isla Vista Brewing Company before it became a lecture hall. Or Deja Vu, or Woodstock’s, Freebirds, but there was a spot that was like wherever you met or hung out, that was the spot,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be that spot for people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson believes one of the biggest advantages the shop has in creating that atmosphere is the amount of space they have to accomodate customers. In addition to a large seating area indoors, they also have generous patio space, he noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to other coffee shops in the area, Nelson wants Campus Point Coffee to have “killer WiFi” and late hours, but says the store will be “very responsive to the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson wants to be proactive about asking the community for feedback, particularly in the store’s first few months of being open. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tentative opening day for the shop is Aug. 1, although Nelson said that’s more of a goal than a firm date. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until then, Nelson will be working on finalizing hires, training the staff and finishing up the remodeling of the store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson and his wife are opening up the coffee shop in the same space where Coffee Collaborative used to be.

The Coalition, and Chikukwa, have been fighting for the funding for nearly two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding is separate from the Cal Grant, although it is based on Cal Grant eligibility, Chikukwa said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the funding allocation is a win for the CBUC, it does come with an asterisk; if there is not sufficient projected revenue in the California General Fund during the 2021-22 fiscal year and the 2022-23 fiscal year, the combined $10 million in funding will be suspended on Dec. 31, 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a suspension happens, the California Legislature intends to “consider alternative solutions to restore this program,” Senate Bill 106, the bill written to implement this portion of the budget, reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at UC Santa Barbara said in a </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ucsbfinaid/status/1144756479125159937\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it is waiting on more information from the state and the UC Office of the President (UCOP) before releasing an official statement on when the money will be distributed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email, Saúl Quiroz, director of UCSB’s Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, said that students will receive the standard message they get any time there is a change to their financial aid. However, he said the office will also likely be reaching out to the specific students who will receive this additional funding; students who qualify can use the additional aid beginning this Summer Session A. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If they have a balance, it will first be applied toward that balance. If the funding is enough to cover their balance, or if the student does not have a balance, students will receive the remaining credit in the form of a financial aid refund,” he also clarified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funds will be disbursed in the same way other financial awards are distributed — through a student’s BARC account — Quiroz added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The office is still waiting on “official guidance from the UC Office of the President regarding awarding practices on individual campuses” and more information about how much of the $4 million will be allocated for UCSB, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The allocations for this summer will be tied to historical Cal Grant allocations, and we hope to learn what UCSB’s share will be soon,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quiroz also expressed excitement about the funding and gratitude toward CBUC for the organization’s work over the past two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without their extraordinary effort, this additional funding would have not been made available to our students,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that this funding is the first step toward ensuring that Summer Cal Grants will become a reality in the next year or two.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The additional summer financial aid allocation is not the same as the Summer Cal Grant Bill, Amy Rose, policy analyst at the California Budget and Policy Center — a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Sacramento — emphasized. Rose focuses on studying higher education issues and has “closely followed and researched” various financial aid proposals, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose was the one to clarify to the CBUC that the funding was not technically a Summer Cal Grant Bill, but instead provides summer financial aid to the UC and CSU and is given to students based on Cal Grant eligibility.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cal Grants are administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC), whereas the budget’s “summer financial aid” funding flows directly to the UC and CSU,” she said in an email. “In addition, Cal Grants are available to students at California Community Colleges and the private institutions, whereas the budget’s funding is restricted to students at UC and CSU.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, students could use their Cal Grant aid during the summer, although there is a cap on a student’s lifetime eligibility that may leave them ineligible for that aid in the future, Rose said. The new summer aid means students won’t have to draw from their Cal Grant to cover the costs of summer classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget allocation differs in that it provides money directly to the UC and CSU to distribute but is still based on Cal Grant eligibility, Chikukwa explained. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power. It may seem daunting at first, but it’s such a powerful and underrated way to get things done.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The language of SB 106 is left vague, giving most of the discretion to the CSU and UC campuses on how to distribute it, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose said that one reason for the vague language was to give the universities the ability to work with their own institutional aid programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s possible that the ambiguity was to allow room for both institutions to distribute aid through their existing programs (which have their own goals, criteria, etc.),” she wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose also added that previous versions of the bill allocated funding solely for tuition and fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[T]he new spending plan does not use that language so it is unclear if this summer aid will be used for tuition and fees or for living costs such as housing and food, which many low-income students struggle to afford,” Rose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa, who has been working toward securing additional summer financial aid for students since Fall Quarter 2017, said that while there was a lot of excitement after CBUC’s</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CoalitionForABetterUC/posts/1476519299140032?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCv8FnYqJItuzzrHm4xgmt5zBz-bEYkdecwdLS8i1QIqCFJ7BeYnclayQs2J6G48l24KvLi-l9AIC5snV-miZjhQsSqiHS9zhp7zY4IGKQ4Wc5CSBntDJvFTHeIkL94WEflllosVMWyIrja1Us5iurUyrephO22Wp-EA1qg1cYsBJdkIXOhRqE3_tOZskfiS0ZcHk23IsD0s_Zy1XoBCrCIY-nWu88RqeXiPM2dscxYXfAWs8DG6v4A053h9o2n2x0LlME2bWnvdPvpwjXqZOiw7gnRrA_XsiJnKo0gQhyHtpZUt0Z3gjjf8XK1c9okEdL7XBOuuEk9ImOA2ANll-9ofg&amp;__tn__=H-R\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> announcement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this morning, there were still a lot of questions, too, which is what he and other members of the coalition are now working to clarify. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CBUC has focused its efforts on the Summer Cal Grant Bill for the past two years but has been working on various other projects behind the scenes as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing about the Coalition is there is no specific thing you can say, ‘This is all we do.’ We do a bunch of different things … it was always, ‘We need to be flexible to do whatever we think is the most necessary thing,’” Chikukwa said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he is now the “retired chair,” as he jokingly referred to himself as, Chikukwa has high hopes for the Coalition’s future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know [future Coalition members] are gonna be better than us,” he said. “And when I say better than us, I mean in the sense that they’re gonna do whatever they do, in a manner that’s better than the way we approached our problems, because they got to see a lot of our failures. They got to see a lot of our successes, also.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa noted that most of the members of CBUC are underclassmen or are entering their junior years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daevionne Beasley, incoming director of internal affairs for CBUC and Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs, said the work the Coalition did would not have been possible without the support of individual students and various student groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power. It may seem daunting at first, but it’s such a powerful and underrated way to get things done,” he said in a message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa also attributed CBUC’s success to “all the students who either signed a petition, called, lobbied, retweeted, shared” or engaged with their social media in any way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That, I believe, was the tipping point. It was a grassroots movement, and there was a lot of people, so many people at the table who made this happen outside the Coalition for a Better UC.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: [6/29]: A previous version of this article said that SB461 did not make it past the Committee on Higher Education; the story is updated to clarify that the bill was paused once the budget ask looked like the better avenue to pursue.</em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">UCen Director Gary Lawrence <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said he hopes to have the signs installed by July 15. </span><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Converting the restrooms, located by the Associated Students offices and the Graduate Student Association Lounge, only requires changing the signage on the door. Gary Lawrence, director of the University Center (UCen), said he hopes to have the signs installed by July 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen Governance Board worked with Dwayne Mosbey, program coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), to learn more about the process of converting the bathrooms and the potential costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey was invited to speak at a UCen Governance Board meeting in May as a representative of the Trans Task Force, which has been advocating for more all-gender restrooms on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My purpose in going [to the meeting] was telling them what the steps have been with [the RCSGD] in the conversion of multi-stall restrooms, especially because there is no written policy within the UC code about how that is to be implemented, and we just recently finished the conversions for the Social Sciences and Media Studies building,” Mosbey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1732\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal Restroom Access Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, approved by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016, requires all single-stall restrooms in a “business establishment, place of public accommodation, or state or local government agency” in California to be marked as all-gender. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the bill does not address multi-stall restroom conversions, Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey, along with RCSGD Director Craig Leets and UCSB Policy Coordinator Jennifer Lofthus, has been working on an outline for a UCSB multi-stall bathroom conversion process to facilitate more conversions in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey also addressed the board’s concerns about renovations to add more stalls, which he said weren’t necessary to have the restrooms converted. The total cost of converting the restrooms is about $300 to $350, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costs associated with single-stall restroom conversions are typically covered by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services, but Mosbey said the office did not want to cover the costs for multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board is still considering renovations to the restrooms, Mosbey cautioned against renovations, noting that they take much longer than signage changes and could create animosity toward people who identify as transgender or nonbinary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey is sitting on a special advisory committee over the summer to discuss what renovations would be necessary, if any. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD has been directing its efforts on bathroom conversion projects throughout this past year, with a focus on converting multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey’s first step was to update the </span><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/AGRmap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All-Gender Restroom Map</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which details the locations of all-gender restrooms on campus. He is also working with the Department of Geography to signify all-gender restrooms on the new interactive campus map the department is working on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center’s next priorities are identifying all the single-stall restrooms on campus that still need to be converted and working with different departments on campus to convert multi-stall restrooms in their buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said that department heads and vice chancellor hold the power to approve these bathroom conversions. The multi-stall bathroom conversion in the Social Sciences and Media Studies building was the first multi-stall conversion the center helped facilitate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal is to get an all-gender restroom in every building on campus. But a realistic timeline of that, it could take up to years, depending on how many kinds of barriers we run into, whether departments actually end up agreeing to doing it,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

So with that in mind, as long as the students stay Cal Grant- and Pell Grant-eligible while they’re here, then why would we not promise them four years of federal packaging?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the condition that the Promise Scholar students remain </span><a href=\"https://www.csac.ca.gov/post/how-do-i-qualify-cal-grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– and </span><a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pell Grant-eligible</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through their four years of college, they are guaranteed $120,000 in grants and scholarships when they first come to UCSB from the federal, state and institutional level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program requires students to sign contracts agreeing to maintain a 2.75 GPA upon arrival to UCSB, file their taxes on time, complete their FAFSA on time and take a handful of mandatory classes and workshops throughout their time at the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also have to agree to fill out surveys during and after their time at UCSB to help with the “continued funding and success” of the program, according to the program’s </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/promise-scholars-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the financial support, the program provides students with what Roose calls “wraparound services,” which include counseling and one-on-one support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program initially included only monetary aid when it was first started in 2015, but when Roose arrived in June 2016, it grew to include additional services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Mike Miller, who started the program, realized very quickly that you can’t just give low-income, first-generation, underrepresented students money and be like, ‘Here, go to college,’ and expect them to be able to survive,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose worked in the McNair Scholars Program at San Diego State before coming to UCSB, and said she drew from her experience there, particularly with programming, to help build the Promise Scholars Program into what it is today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose operates as a resource for students to go to with any problems and even keeps stacks of business cards for various UCSB entities on her desk so she can easily direct students to the services they need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with a small staff, Roose said it is difficult for her and her two part-time assistants to serve the needs of all 428 students in the program, especially since they have a policy of never turning a student away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose also recently started a mini-Promise Scholars Program with Joe O’Brien, assistant dean of the College of Letters &amp; Science Advising, in the form of INT 10: “Transitioning to Academic Excellence,” a course “to help students get acclimated to the university and to help build them a safety net,” Roose said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Roose runs a Scholar Retention Program, also created by Miller, to allow students who are academically disqualified and lose their financial aid to return during the summer and take classes. If they receive two B’s during their summer classes, they are able to get back into school, Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these various initiatives require more hours, and a larger staff would help Roose maintain these programs, serve the current cohort of Promise Scholars and expand the program to benefit as many students as possible, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once the students are admitted to UCSB, we just cull the most extreme low-income from that group and then we just narrow it down from there based on grades in high school and how promising of a student we think they’re gonna be,” Roose said about the selection process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t have enough money to bring in every low-income student. Otherwise we would.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose believes that college should be free for everybody and hopes the Promise Scholars Program expands to the rest of the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Merced has already picked up this program, and they’ve started offering their students Promise Scholars opportunities,” she said. “And I think Berkeley is considering picking it up. So it would be nice if we could get this program everywhere.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, Roose is taking a minute to celebrate the accomplishments of this first graduating class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have students that were admitted into USC, into Harvard, into Duke, UPenn, Michigan State and UCSB Ph.D. programs and Master’s programs. And then we have some that are going to be going directly into industries,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Roose, the best part of the program is being a part of the journey her students undergo in college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s incredible because you just go through everything with them. I’ve met some of their families, I’ve been there for them when their whole world is falling apart, I’ve been there with them when they’ve won amazing awards and it’s just ups and downs all day long,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyna Nguyen, a Promise Scholars student and linguistics major who graduated this past weekend, said that without the program, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I may not have had a college career at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming from a single parent household, there was no way I could’ve afforded an education at UCSB without getting myself into a ridiculous amount of debt,” Nguyen said in an email.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89082\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89082\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89082\" data-attachment-id=\"89082\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89082\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=278%2C371\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nguyen is part of the first graduating class from the Promise Scholars Program.<em> Courtesy of Lyna Nguyen</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the first graduating class, Nguyen has seen the program grow and take shape as Roose and Miller figured out what worked best for the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last four years, I’ve watched the program grow into stable home for students like me.

But when I was at my lowest and drowning, Promise Scholars didn’t abandon me. Quite the opposite; they never left my side.

The other side of that is, we got 10 campuses of the UC, and a lot of them are very different,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a lot of different majors, lot of different career trajectories, lots of different aspirations, and these different perspectives that come from the campus space and the discipline space are valid.

But I have friends struggling for rent, struggling for tuition. I can’t imagine an added fee,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was the desire to strike a good balance between paying artists for their art and making grad photos as accessible as possible that led her to create the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison was initially going to stake out by Henley Gate alone, but then she decided to post on Facebook about her idea to get more photographers for the event. Once she had heard back from a handful of people, she set up a group chat for everyone to schedule themselves for shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Niko Van Eimeren, one of the photographers at the event, said she signed up to help because she personally understood the struggle graduating students face when paying for end-of-the-year expenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fourth-year environmental studies major, Van Eimeren said she herself wasn’t sure if she was going to get her graduation photos taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[For] a lot of my friends, I took their photos for them at a discounted rate ‘cause I know that it can be really expensive,” Van Eimeren said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alejandra Gularte, one of the students who attended the event to have her photos taken, said she appreciated the event’s impact on both graduating students and photographers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I found it was a way to help smaller photographers that maybe wanted to get practice. But also, for me, it’s cheaper, because I pay a lot of money for school,” Gularte said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison gives all the credit for the event to the photographers who signed up to help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This was only possible because people were volunteering their time to do their photos,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Photography isn’t always something you’d think would be something you could do to help people,” Morrison said.  “Anyone can really do something like this, stuff like this means a lot to people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted that as a graduating student, it can be difficult to see all of your friends posting their photos and not be able to afford them yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a good grad photo to give to their mom — it’s like a small thing in your day, but honestly would make someone’s day,” she said. “If you can, take time out of your personal life to do a nice thing once in a while.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year art major Reannah Viray took inspiration from that idea and put her own twist on it.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88921\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88921\" data-attachment-id=\"88921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/pay-what-you-can-photography-event-inspires-other-students-to-give-back/pay-what-you-can_sanya-kamidi_online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1246&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1246\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pay What You Can_Sanya Kamidi_ONLINE (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88921 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=888%2C553\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray hosted her own pay-what-you-can event for graduating seniors on Wednesday in the Arbor, offering her art services to anyone who wanted their cap decorated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a photographer in high school, so I wish that I could have participated, but I didn’t know how to until it was over, so I was like, ‘what other way can I spare my time to people who don’t have the resources or the income necessarily to get grad caps done?’” Viray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s nice to be able to offer something that could be seen as a luxury to people that can’t afford it.

So for [transfer students] to even be in this position [to graduate], especially people of color, it’s so monumental. It really takes a lot for us to get here and to even graduate from a four-year institution,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think a lot of us expect [to graduate].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for Hernandez, and for the numerous transfer students graduating with the class of 2019, the Transfer Student Graduation is an “acknowledge[ment] that we did beat the statistics and that we are here. You achieved this. You deserve it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the second year the Transfer Student Graduation has been held. Last year, the Transfer Student Graduation welcomed around 50 students; this year’s will see over 120, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current Transfer Student Graduation Committee is mainly led by fourth-years Neyra Patricio, Katherin Jordan, Sophie Weimer and Hernandez; the committee began planning for graduation during Winter Quarter, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s budget to hold the entire graduation was $200. This year’s is $2,000, an improvement Hernandez attributes to the Transfer Student Alliance’s transformation from an organization to an Associated Students Boards, Commission and Units (BCU). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Hernandez and Patricio, having a transfer student graduation is incredibly important in a number of ways, but particularly because of the unique and shared experiences that transfer students go through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because [the ceremony is] different. Most transfer students only have transfer friends, at least the people that I know, so getting to have a graduation ceremony with people that you know [is good], especially because a lot of transfers value it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all really nervous for it to get here, but we also want it to get here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, who was also involved in the planning of the Transfer Student Graduation during its first year, echoed Patricio’s sentiments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that being on Senate with the 69th Senate and working on the Transfer Student Alliance allowed him to see students “get rewarded for all the hard work they’ve done.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing it last year, how it impacted and how it meant so much to many students… There’s literally people crying [at the ceremony] and it was very emotional and very intense, but it was good,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Hernandez and Patricio hope the tradition of a transfer student graduation ceremony continues after they both leave UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope we built the tradition and it keeps on going,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s ceremony will be held on June 14 in Bren Courtyard at 5 p.m. There will also be a reception at 6:30 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lavender Graduation and Pride Awards:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lavender Graduation — a graduation ceremony dedicated toward UCSB students who identify as members of the LGBTQIA+ community — has been running for 19 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony, alongside the Pride Awards, has served as an “integral part” of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), according to UCSB alumnus ‘18 and RCSGD Programming Coordinator Dwayne Mosbey, who helped plan this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Lavender Graduation] began to create a space for queer and trans students, especially when they were entering spaces they didn’t necessarily feel comfortable in or within an insitution they didn’t feel was serving them,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The planning of this year’s ceremony was a “collaborative effort” between Mosbey, RCSGD Director Craig Leets and Associative Director Quinn Solis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey explained that in previous years, the Pride Awards used to be separate; this year, they were “rolled together” because both are “made to recognize queer and trans students’ resilience and academic achievement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We thought it’d be great for those two to be coupled together,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduation ceremony itself is modeled similarly to the typical UCSB graduation, Mosbey said. The ceremony will see graduates “walk” into the Student Resource Building forum, following a welcome ceremony with a number of speakers, which typically includes the vice chancellor, a keynote speaker and a student speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said there are typically 30 to 35 people who partake in the ceremony; this year saw an uptick, rounding out to 45 students. Last year, Mosbey himself was one of the people who walked in the Lavender Graduation ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows the chance for queer and trans students to be recognized outside of the larger ceremony, and [anyone] can come to the Lavender Graduation. [They can express] their most gender expression and gender identity and feel comfortable with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can wear whatever they want and can also decorate their gowns and caps — “This is all about making sure [queer and trans students] feel comfortable and that they feel recognized.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All graduates who go through the Lavender Graduation ceremony are awarded purple cords, while folks who work at the RCSGD and people who win awards receive rainbow tassels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of awards also varies, depending on the number of nominations. This year, 13 awards will be handed out, according to Mosbey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey hopes students who go through the ceremony will take away one key thing: “We’re allowing that space for them to feel supported, [so they] know that throughout their college career, the queer and trans community was here for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And that we will continue to be here for them even after they graduate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s Lavender Graduation will happen on June 9 between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. in the Student Resource Building forum. </span></p>\n<p><b>Black Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony Bolden, a fourth-year biopsychology major and the undergraduate speaker for this year’s Black Graduation, said he almost turned down the opportunity to speak at this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was kind of hesitant, just because </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do have pretty good experience with public speaking, but I didn’t feel like I wanted to add that [burden] on for myself,” he said. “But then [the offer] gave me a little bit of moment of clarity, because I got a chance to look back and see how far I’ve really come.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of realized that it was a little bit humbling,” Bolden added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden is one of the 55 Black undergraduate and graduate students who will be participating in this year’s Black Graduation ceremony on Saturday, June 15 at noon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Stallworth, co-chair of the organizing committee and second-year sociology and Black studies double major, said it’s important for Black students to have a space where they can come together and celebrate their achievements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The educational system wasn’t really built for people of color in general, but for Black students, we really had to fight for us to have our identity be present on campus,” Stallworth said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony is a way for Black students to do just that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth said the ceremony will have a mix of student speakers as well as spoken word, musical performances and slideshows of the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Jeffrey Stewart, from UCSB’s Department of Black Studies, and Professor R. L’Heureux Lewis-McCoy from New York University’s Department of Applied Statistics, Social Science and Humanities, are the two faculty speakers. Meridith Merchant, a psychologist from Counseling and Psychological Services, is the closing speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth believes the speakers’ words will leave an impression on the graduating students and is looking forward to hearing from them all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The speech is] sending a message and it’s setting the tone for someone’s life,” he said. “I think it’s just really important to have speakers that really motivate and empower students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth is also happy to see the graduates — many of whom have helped him in his two years at UCSB — step off the stage and onto a new chapter after college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I’m] also just excited to see all the Black grads and be able to celebrate them because I think it’s amazing how they’ve been really mentors for me throughout my time here at UCSB. I get to see them go off, and I get to follow in their footsteps.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden echoed Stallworth’s words, naming several other students who will be graduating alongside him  as inspirations over the past few years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to talking about the achievements of the Black community at UCSB over the past few years, Bolden said he wants to highlight the growth of individual students like Zenzile Riddick and Kuvimbanashe “Eddie” Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This class of Black grads is phenomenal. One of my hallmates, she’s going to freakin’ Harvard, that’s amazing, Zenzile. Since first year, I knew she was going to be amazing,” Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said he’s proud to have seen everyone’s growth over the past four years and where they’re all headed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m proud to be part of the 5% that has come through here. I definitely recognize that a lot of people don’t have such a positive outlook of UCSB like I have, not everyone’s been blessed with the great experience that I’ve had here,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[But] after coming here, I think that my pride in being a Black man has done nothing but grown exponentially, because I feel like I’m representing my own people here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A special part of the ceremony for Bolden is the fact that a large portion of the Black graduates participating in the ceremony lived together in the Black Scholars Hall in Santa Rosa during their first year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to be around each other and enjoy each other’s presence and see each other’s faces and see us finish through,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At typical graduation ceremonies, it’s easy for Black students to feel like less of a community, Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing us spread so thin isn’t the same, isn’t nearly as powerful for us being together, having our own space, our own ceremony, our own opportunity to recognize one another.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said his speech at the Black Graduation ceremony will be one of the first times his family will see him in an academic setting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now this is an opportunity for me to show [my mom] what I’ve been doing this whole time.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Chicanx/Latinx Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chicanx/Latinx Graduation ceremony is just as much about the community behind students as it is about the graduating students themselves, two of the organizers said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesenia Cardenas, a fifth-year chemistry major, and Jessica Arenas, a fourth-year global studies major, agreed their favorite part of the ceremony is when the students walk into Harder Stadium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students are asked to bring two people to walk them in as live mariachi music plays in the background and photographers snap photos of them, the two said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students, they feel like they get their degree for family too, so it’s nice that you can walk up there, it’s almost like they’re walking up there with you,” Cardenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas sit on an 11-member organizing committee that begins its work one full year before graduation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s cabinet, which organized the 45th Chicanx/Latinx Graduation being held on Saturday, June 15, 2019 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., was dedicated to giving more voice to graduating students throughout the whole process, Cardenas and Arenas both said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year we’ve been focusing a lot on being inclusive of Central American identities because that’s a prominent issue, the erasure of Central Americans,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB is recognized as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, Arenas said it can be hard to actually feel that they are supported or represented on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a first-generation student, it’s hard to navigate higher education, and sometimes you don’t see people that look like you, in your classroom settings or even in your living settings sometimes,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like most students enjoy the Chicanx/Latinx Graduation because it celebrates their identity and also their cultural background. They aren’t represented in classrooms, but they do feel represented in the graduation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to infusing the ceremony with various cultural elements, the committee works to ensure that the ceremony caters to family members who attend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ceremony, held in Harder Stadium, will have over 500 students walking the stage. A lot of those students are first-generation and have parents who don’t speak English, Cardenas said, so they will have a translator present so their parents can follow along as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From my personal experience, my parents don’t really know what I do here, they just know that I go to school and I’m studying,” Arenas laughed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas said that while friends and family back home might not understand what they’re studying, they’re still very proud of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d rather them understand the ceremony than just sitting there and see all these names called out. At least with [Chicanx/Latinx Graduation] there’s performances and Spanish,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><b>Undocumented Student Services:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monarch butterfly, adorning a pin which many undocumented graduating students will be wearing as they walk the stage, is a symbol of migration, Undocumented Student Services Coordinator Diana Valdivia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To wear this pin is to recognize the impact migration has had in your life experiences. This pin is a small token of your resiliency and accomplishments,” a small note accompanying the pin reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undocumented Student Services began to distribute the pins to graduating undocumented students last year, Valdivia said. The pins are meant to recognize both undocumented students and others who participate in the services’ programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At its year-end ceremony, the service recognizes different student leaders for their work and advocacy in the undocumented student community on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Valdivia said they had approximately 30 students graduating, compared to around 25 last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s good to know for [undocumented students] that they’re graduating, that they’re not the only one that is graduating that has been through this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the service also handed out separate pins for students to give to their loved ones and supporters, one of which reads “Proud Immigrant Dad of a Graduating Senior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We recognize that students get pins, get stoles and then we also know that it took a community effort to have folks graduate,” Valdivia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Valdivia said they hope to find a way to recognize students who may not be undocumented themselves but have family members or loved ones who are. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The new space is 981 square feet and has two offices and a bathroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center currently has approximately 550 square feet and is composed of one small room and an office. But this current space is not large enough to accommodate to students in need of private meeting spaces, according to Coby Dillard, veterans and military services coordinator.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard said an ideal “one-stop shop” resource center would have an academic advisor, a counselor and a certifying official who can double as a financial aid representative and provide any other resources that an incoming veteran student would need, all in one place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Dillard said, when a student comes to the center, he can “help to a degree,” but at the end of the day, he often has to direct them to multiple different places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Research says that if you have individuals who can come into a single location and get all their assistance, over the long-term, they perform better academically,” Dillard added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new location takes a step toward a “one-stop shop” with larger square footage and dedicated meeting rooms, which Dillard can use to set up office hours for various advisors to drop in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Dillard isn’t the first one who has tried to turn the center into a “one-stop shop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, two student veterans presented a list of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/veterans-fight-for-more-resources-at-ucsb/\">grievances and demands</a> for change to Chancellor Henry T. Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First on the list of demands was a “space that can continuously accommodate quiet study, lounge, peer to peer tutoring, mental health and VA counseling…. These rooms will not be decentralized and will share a similar location or structure.” But Dillard described this demand as only partially fulfilled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, the center occupied a 10-by-10 foot space in building 477, across the courtyard from the current office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of the demands, roughly 400 members of the entire student body were military-related, which includes veterans, military dependents, reserve duty students and more. Dillard said that number has now increased to over 520. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the one-stop shop model is years in the making, the center’s high staff turnover made it difficult for any real progress to be made, according to Dillard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard is the fourth person since 2012 to run the program. The first two coordinators stepped down to go back to school, and the third served as an interim coordinator until Dillard was hired in July 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff turnover is also the reason why so many of the unspoken agreements that the center has with other departments on campus are not formal policies, Dillard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Institutionally, a lot of our policies exist, but they’re not formalized anywhere,” Dillard said. “I know all the veterans get priority registration… And then the question in here is ‘Is there a formal written policy?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of my relationships with other offices across campus are based on understandings that have worked, not necessarily formal policy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Dillard came to UCSB, his goal for his first year was “just stabilizing the place.” From there, Dillard said he moved on to assessing which areas of the center were in need of the most attention, and how he could best go about fixing them next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In September 2018, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked UCSB as the number four public school in the nation for veterans and 10th nationwide </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but Dillard finds that “rankings like that don’t necessarily reflect what the student experience is because that particular ranking did not ask any questions about the student experience.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, Dillard finds that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s survey, “Best for Vets” is a better metric as it accounts for “services and student experience.” Next year, Dillard plans to have veteran students at UCSB complete the survey so the university can be ranked on the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> survey.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard’s ideas for the center stem from years of experience of working with veterans, most recently in Virginia Beach, Va. Dillard said that coming to UCSB and working as a coordinator was the next progression for his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After doing this for seven, eight years, this is kind of the next progression for me career-wise,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next natural step is to run a program and if you’re going to run a program, [UCSB’s program] wouldn’t be bad to start with [because it is] one that is in need of some sort of strengthening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For his first Memorial Day at UCSB, Dillard wanted to not only honor former and current service members, but also make the holiday more visible to the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the Veterans and Military Services program installed a “flag garden” made up of 2,000 flags planted in the open green space between the Annex and Storke Lawn.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think everyone either appreciated it being there, or once they were told why it was there, then they appreciated it being there,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events like this are one way for Dillard and the program to increase visibility and awareness of veteran students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Dillard has several aspirations for the center in the next few years, the most significant one is emphasizing the importance of developing the Veterans and Military Services program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one actually has been here long enough to take it from a resource center to a program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard hopes to be the one to change this.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 30, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Each bench had a photo of the victim as well as a short paragraph about them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd entered Anisq’oyo Park, Kira Weiss, Ph.D. ethnomusicology student at UCSB, played several songs on the cello to welcome them in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once everyone was settled in, Weiss played a theme composed by Heena Yoon, Ph.D. candidate in music, three times in a row, and asked the audience to hum along. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The theme, called “Hope in the Labyrinth,” has been played every year since 2014, Weiss said, but this is the first time she has been able to play it at the annual vigil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The indication for how to play [the theme] is slowly, in grief, but then it’s also supposed to be hopeful too and I think [Yoon’s] idea with everybody humming together is like trying to find connection and find the strength of our voices together,” Weiss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer and Collins Puente spoke once again after the cello music and thanked the audience for attending before introducing the first speaker of the evening, Chancellor Henry T. Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a heartfelt turnout from our students, our staff and our colleagues, professors and our community members,” Yang began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are all coming together as a community to honor and remember one of the campus’s most difficult moments. Five years ago, our university faced an unthinkable tragedy. We suffered the tragic loss of six of our own and saw pain inflicted on nine injured. When one hurts, we all hurt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang went on to name each of the victims and talked about the hopes, dreams and ambitions they carried. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each of these six students were shining stars, beaming with the same brilliance and warmth like the candles among us,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We suffered the tragic loss of six of our own and saw pain inflicted on nine injured. When one hurts, we all hurt.” </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next speaker, UCPD Officer Ariel Bournes, touched upon his own experience as a first responder that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes, who studied art at UCSB, worked as a community service officer (CSO) when he attended UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes later worked on community outreach for the UCSB police department for several years. But at the end of the day, he found that many of the conversations he had with students and community members ended with them expressing frustration that other police officers didn’t feel the same way as he did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of the conversations ended something like this: ‘Hey Ariel, that was awesome that you came out, and you listened, and you conversed with us. But here’s the thing: you’re not even a police officer!’” Bournes said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After I heard that speech one too many times, I decided, ‘I’m gonna become a police officer.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a goofy kid who “regularly walked around with paint splattered on [his] clothing from various art projects [he] was working on,” Bournes said even his own mother didn’t think he could become a police officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he faced the same sentiment from several other police officers in the department, there was one officer who Bournes said gave him a chance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of them said, ‘Okay, you should come on a ride-along with me.’ So we looked at our schedules, we worked it out and we circled the date.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes paused for a long time, as audience members began to put the story together in their heads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he finally spoke again, his voice cracked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“May 23, 2014.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Less than 30 minutes into my first police ride-along, the shooting started. I got a front row seat to things that no one should ever have to see. And here I stand, five years later, now an officer myself, thinking back to that moment, and thinking back to the hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of moments that we all shared as a community in the aftermath.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the one thing Bournes wanted attendees to remember was how the community responded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We used art and protest and therapy and faith and food and tears and research and collaboration and passion and planning in order to heal and to protect and to overcome. It was exemplary. It was astonishing. And it was, and it is, an honor and a privilege to be counted as even a small piece of this community. Isla Vista, you are the template. You are a gift and we love you.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-88670-2-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC04923.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88673\",\"title\":\"DSC04923\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC04988.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88681\",\"title\":\"DSC04988\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC05128.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88692\",\"title\":\"DSC05128\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC05045.jpg?fit=1874%2C2048\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88685\",\"title\":\"DSC05045\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC05058.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88686\",\"title\":\"DSC05058\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC04975.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88679\",\"title\":\"DSC04975\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes’ remarks were followed by a reading of the names of the victims, a moment of silence and a song of remembrance by Meijer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, spoke afterward. Klawunn, who arrived on campus in Fall Quarter 2015, spoke about how even though she wasn’t here when the community suffered the tragedy, she was able to see how it came together in the months and years afterward to become stronger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have learned so much about [the victims’] legacies through the values of community here,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I love the features of our everyday lives that arise from the love and strength that members of this community found in themselves in 2014, like the cranes in the Student Resource Building, the lights in the tunnel that we walked through tonight and in the Love and Remembrance Garden,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The parents of Christopher Michaels-Martinez, Katie Cooper and George Chen all spoke at the memorial event as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Martinez, Christopher Michaels-Martinez’s father, read a poem by Courtney Martin titled “A Responsibility to Light.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The poem urged listeners to feel their emotions strongly, even the difficult ones, and to use those feelings to drive them to create art of any kind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan Cooper, Katie Cooper’s father, talked about how much his daughter loved I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She had offers at three other universities, and came here on an open event; it was kind of an open house, with one of her girl friends. And in about ten minutes she was like ‘This is where I needed to be,’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She just loved it, and really felt at home here, and I think that’s a tribute to everybody who’s here today, and what you’ve brought to the community and what you’ve brought to the university.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly Wang, George Chen’s mother, thanked the audience, and the two fathers, for helping her feel like she isn’t going through this alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As you all see, it’s not easy, and it’s even heartbreaking, for me to be here, because I know at the end of this trip, coming all the way from San Jose, I won’t be able to see the beautiful face of my son George,” Wang said. “However, I choose to stand here, bravely, because I want to share some of the words from my heart with you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“First, I want to say, with a mother’s heart, I care about you, and I think every student of UCSB, or every college student, is my child.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang urged audience members to always be kind, even in little ways, to the people around them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Wang, several long-time community members – Associated Students Executive Director Marisela Marquez, Ph.D. candidate Melissa Barthelemy, I.V. Community Services District General Manager Jonathan Abboud and Educational Opportunity Program Director Aaron Jones – all spoke about how moved they were by the way I.V. came together in the days after the shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the memorial came to an end, Collins Puente tearfully thanked the audience for attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And thank you to everyone that continues to create and hold space for our beloved community.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arturo Martinez Rivera contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p>Further photos of all of the memorial events held between May 18 and May 23 can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/in-photos-five-years-since-may-23-2014/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
