style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeAngelo, a former police officer in Auburn and Visalia, is linked by DNA to homicides in Goleta in 1981 and is also believed to be responsible for two other murders and two attempted murders in 1979 in Goleta, according to the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 72-year-old suspect was living in Citrus Heights, California at the time of his arrest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, DeAngelo is tied to 51 rapes and 12 murders, according to Bruce Harrington, a brother and brother-in-law of two of the victims from Orange County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the 51 rapes and 12 murders, DeAngelo is also potentially linked to hundreds of burglaries that occurred between the late ‘70s to the mid ‘80s, according to SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeAngelo is suspected to have attacked a Goleta couple in 1979 while they were asleep at home. While both victims were able to escape, DeAngelo “evaded capture,” according to SBSO. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Dec. 30, 1979, two people were murdered in their residence near Goleta, according to a SBSO press release. Two people were also found murdered in a home that they had been housesitting near Goleta on July 27, 1981, the press release stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we commence the charging and prosecution of DeAngelo, this too, will be a team effort involving many jurisdictions working collaboratively and collectively together,” Ventura County District Attorney Gregory Totten said at a press conference held by the Sacramento District Attorney’s office on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After his brother’s death, Harrington struggled to “bring DNA in California to the forefront of forensic crime scene investigation tools.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early 2000s, he appeared before the Assembly, the Senate and Public Safety Committees in Sacramento, working to appeal to them about using DNA in their investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To the entire reservoir of victims out there, my sadness is with you. For the 51 ladies who were brutally raped in this crime scene, sleep better tonight. He isn’t coming through the window,” Harrington said at the press conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley said that while not all of the crimes linked to DeAngelo were purely based on DNA, they are all believed to be tied to him by “his modus operandi or by DNA.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, DeAngelo is suspected to be responsible for crimes across 10 counties: Sacramento County, San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County, Yolo County, Contra Costa County, Santa Clara County, Alameda County, Santa Barbara County, Ventura County and Orange County. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

United, and Vanessa Maldonado, with the Isla Vista Party, are the two candidates running for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their opening remarks, Maldonado spoke about wanting to integrate the Student Apartment Council in A.S. and wanting to expand resources like CalFresh and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) for students in university-owned off-campus apartments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez’s focus was about offering students a direct voice in senate and holding office hours at various university-owned off-campus apartments so students living there do not feel separated. </span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to focus on mental health services and work with the Santa Catalina residence hall to open up their C.A.P.S. center to students in university-owned off-campus housing. She would also like to implement free yoga programs like ones that currently exist in the freshman dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to focus on revamping the orientation program for transfer students, since most students living in university-owned off-campus housing are transfer students. He said he is currently working with the Transfer Student Alliance on this issue and is interested in addressing the issue to make more students feel welcome at UC Santa Barbara when they first arrive. </span></p>\n<p><b>UNI-OWNED APARTMENTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez plans to hold office hours within the various university-owned off-campus buildings in order to make himself and his position more available to students, as opposed to them having to come on campus to voice their concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado would work with the Student Apartment Council to fully integrate it with A.S., and she would also like to work with the transfer senator that is elected to meet the needs of students in university-owned off-campus housing.</span></p>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, as a current on-campus senator, explained she already has an understanding of the inner workings of A.S. and has experience listening to students’ concerns during public forum. She also believes that her strides to educate herself about issues regarding women of color make her better qualified to work as a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez was the first diversity director for the Transfer Student Alliance and helped the organization work toward becoming an official A.S. entity. He also kickstarted the first transfer student graduation event, which is occurring later this year. </span></p>\n<p><b>STUDENTS’ NUMBER ONE PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez is interested in making students more active in their community, and he believes the best way to do so is by making resources available to students near their housing and not just on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado also wants to increase accessibility to resources provided by A.S. to students in university-owned off-campus apartments. In addition, she wants to increase awareness of C.A.P.S. and CalFresh. </span></p>\n<p><b>FAMILIES AND FACULTY OFF-CAMPUS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, in order to reach out to these communities, would canvass or send out polls in order for people to voice their concerns and tell her what they need from her. She’s also interested in forming a council or committee for these communities to be represented in A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to open up dialogue to these communities, as he explained that he does not live there and would not immediately know how to address their concerns, but is interested in finding out and working with theExternal Vice President for Statewide Affairs’ (EVPSA) office to get more funding for families and faculty in off-campus housing. </span></p>\n<p><b>UNIVERSITY APARTMENTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez is interested in implementing more social activities for students in university-owned off-campus housing. He also wants to have more organizations come to them so that students in those buildings are aware of organizations on campus that represent them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to continue to attend the meetings that students in university-owned off-campus housing hold and increase mental health resources available to them. </span></p>\n<p><b>PARKING:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to offer the University Apartment Council the opportunity to directly voice their concerns to A.S. by integrating the council into A.S. She would also want to work with them to see if they already have ideas to solve the issue and just need help implementing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to open up this issue to the students and hear about ideas that they might have to address the issue and work to execute them as well as work with the EVPSA and External Vice President for Local Affairs’ office to get funding for the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><b>NEW IDEAS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to ensure students’ voices are heard and serve as a liaison between students and A.S. to meet their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado feels the current university-owned off-campus senator has a good working relationship with the Transfer Senator and would like to carry on this relationship because  of the overlapping needs in both communities. She would also like to work closely with the Student Apartment Council, as the current university-owned off-campus senator does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting for the A.S. election began Monday, April 23, and closes Thursday, April 26.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Party candidate for College of Letters &amp; Science Senator, gives listeners at The Hub her platform. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juan Ornelas and Nima Bencohen, from the Isla Vista Party and Campus United respectively, presented their transfer-specific goals at the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All four candidates for Letters and Science senators from the Campus United party, Joshua Takeuchi, Allison Adam, Gabriella Shofet and Emily Quach, were present at the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Party put forth two candidates for the position of Letters and Science senators, Xochitl Briseño and Ricardo Uribe, who both attended the forum as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates were given 30 seconds to make opening remarks, which they used to introduce themselves, their majors, the party they were running with and the position they were running for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a breakdown of each candidate’s response to the questions presented at the forum: </span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bencohen wants to focus on expanding CLAS to upper division courses which he believes will benefit not only transfer students but all students at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas is interested in addressing complaints raised by transfer students about the lack of social interaction fostered between them. He wants to expand programs at the Transfer Student Center to make transfer students feel more at home at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe said his platform is built upon reducing food insecurity on campus and making food more accessible. He wants to accomplish this by expanding the meal ticket program to make food available to all students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeuchi said his main initiative is to set up a “comprehensive website” for student-run businesses that would allow students to gain experience that would prepare them to be competitive applicants in the job market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quach wants to use her experience in the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) office and working for lobby corps to revamp GOLD after “being inspired by other UC’s and what their students are pushing for on their campuses.” Specifically, she wants to implement a class selection shopping cart to streamline the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam wants her first project as a senator to be reading the entire legal code so that she can “know it like the back of [her] hand.” She would also like to create an A.S. school supplies bank, similar to the A.S. Food Bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shofet wants to create a website to connect students and researchers on campus to make research opportunities more accessible for undergraduate students because UCSB is “one of the world’s best research institutions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briseño considers the biggest problem at UCSB to be retention. She wants to “make sure that underrepresented communities have the resources they need to attend this school” and wants to form a committee dedicated to voicing student concerns to the administration. </span></p>\n<p><b>INVOLVEMENT AT UCSB:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briseño referenced her involvement with grassroots movements since her first day at UCSB. She wants to be somebody who “amplifies student voices.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeuchi spoke about his involvement in Sigma Eta Pi, an entrepreneurship fraternity, and believes that his focus on technology will help him come up with “efficient ways to solve student issues.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe cited his work on Pride Week and in helping to put together the Drag Show this past week as an example of how he “knows diversity.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam emphasized her experience working in the EVPLA office, where she helped put on workshops. She also cited her experience working as the CSD coordinator, where she gave students direct access to the local government and their programs, such as the CSO program or UCIV.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quach spoke about how her time in the EVPSA office gave her the opportunity to advocate against tuition hikes on the statewide level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bencohen talked about his involvement with the Gift of Life finding donors for bone marrow. He also spoke about his experience with the Transfer Student Association.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas cited his work on student government at the community college he attended as well as his work as a Student Apartment Complex Coordinator.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shofet believes that dialogue of any kind is important to “bring communities together.”</span></p>\n<p><b>PROJECTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam spoke about “constantly reaching out to the administration” and giving the university a “well-thought out plan” with input from various different communities to give projects a fighting chance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe emphasized his interest in carrying out a meal ticket program and believes that the biggest barrier to its execution is funding. He hopes to allocate the funds that A.S. has power over and work with the university to have an open dialogue about what the program would look like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bencohen, speaking specifically about transfer students, said that one of the biggest problems is the diminished orientation program. He wants to work with the transfer orientation staff at the Office of Student Life to expand the program and pass a resolution within A.S. to allocate funding toward the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quach brought up her plan to revamp G.O.L.D., stating that she would want to work with the UCSB administration and reach out to other UC campuses to collaborate with them and learn about similar projects that they’ve done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas referenced Bencohen’s initiative to make the transfer orientation program more comprehensive, stating that it was a goal of his as well. He said he would want to speak to the Transfer Student Alliance and the administration to talk about how the program can be better.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeuchi spoke again about his plan to create a “comprehensive website,” saying that he would pitch his plan to the administration and use his connections with them to market his plan to the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briseño spoke about wanting to be the voice of the students and cited her experience in grassroot movements on campus as beneficial for that.

Anthony Pimentel, a third-year political science major, is the candidate running with Campus United. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internal Vice President is responsible for presiding over Senate and advising the A.S. President on campus issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho and Pimentel currently serve as on-campus and off-campus senators respectively. As part of their responsibilities as senators, both also work with boards, committees and units (BCUs) and organizations on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the A.S. Senate website, Ho serves with A.S. Publications and Note Taking, Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) and Queer Commission</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel works with the A.S. Food Bank, Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) and Human Rights Board (HRB). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the issues addressed during Tuesday’s debate:</span></p>\n<p><b>LARGEST INTERNAL PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho believes the largest internal problem in A.S. is a “lack of transparency between BCUs, senators and executives,” referencing the issues of procurement that occurred last fall when many members of Associated Students were not told what was happening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said that the biggest problem in A.S. is accountability. He wants to tackle this by expanding the role of the accountability chairs to “ensure that all senators are being held accountable.” </span></p>\n<p><b>LEGAL CODE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel believes that the legal code is the “foundation of the association.” While he believes it is tricky because it’s a fluid document, he says it also serves as a guide for everyone in A.S. and wants to make sure that all senators are aware of how to amend it to meet students’ needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho cited his experience reading the legal code multiple times, saying that when he was first elected senator, he was the first person to write a bill to change the legal code “before other senators even knew what legal code was.” He believes the institutional knowledge he gained working as a senator will allow him to help fix the legal code, as it is currently “outdated.”</span></p>\n<p><b>AD-HOC COMMITTEES:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a co-chair of the Textbook Affordability Committee, Ho said he has “fostered the collaboration of the BCUs, the Student Initiative Recruitment and Retention Committee” to work on getting students involved in the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel is currently a chair for the Mental Health Ad-Hoc Committee and worked on legislation earlier in the year to support students with mental health issues.</span></p>\n<p><b>A.S. WEBSITE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said the A.S. website should be an essential resource for students because the association is in charge of approximately $13 million of public money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho wants to have the association make their resolutions, bills, agendas and BCU minutes accessible to all students and public on the A.S. website. </span></p>\n<p><b>DIVISIONS IN SENATE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho spoke about his current experience in Senate, saying that he “knows what it feels like to have senators across the table dehumanize [him] and marginalize [him].” As IVP, he said he wants to make it clear that hate and personal attacks on other senators cannot and will not be tolerated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel spoke about wanting to effectively facilitate Senate and wants to ensure that “every single senator feels comfortable in the Flying A Room where Senate meetings take place.”</span></p>\n<p><b>CURRENT IVP:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said he believes the current IVP does a great job of keeping Senate organized and bringing people together. However, he wants to make himself more available and encourage one-on-one contact with all senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho also praised the current IVP’s ability to foster a collaborative environment in Senate, saying he’s been able to work on bills and initiatives across party lines. </span></p>\n<p><b>MALE-DOMINATED VOICES IN A.S.:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho recognized it is difficult for female-identifying senators to speak up, but said there are currently an equal number of male and female voices at the table. If elected as IVP, he wants to make sure to constantly remind everyone that every senator at the table has an opinion that should be valued and heard by everyone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel talked about how he has witnessed “mansplaining” in the organization numerous times and wants to create a culture of respecting everyone’s opinions.</span></p>\n<p><b>CONNECTIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel stressed the importance of having “positive, strong relationships” with student leaders and campus organizations as well as the administration in order to get work done. Pimentel personally worked with Marisela Marquez and Housing and Residential Services in his time as a senator and wants to continue to strengthen those relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho said he was “heavily involved” in the demands for the RCSGD and the undocumented students’ demands for access to more resources. He said his involvement in these initiatives as well as with Campus Democrats has allowed him to make connections with administrators and student leaders on campus. </span></p>\n<p><b>FAVORITE RESOLUTION:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho said his favorite resolution he authored was one that called for the resignation of the director of the RCSGD because the student staff felt the director was not meeting their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel’s favorite resolution he authored was a recent one condemning anti-semitism and hate speech on campus.</span></p>\n<p><b>NEWCEN INITIATIVE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said having the NewCen initiative on the ballot allows students to have the opportunity to vote on the project and have their voices heard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho expressed strong opposition to the fact students would have to pay for the NewCen project. He said students already pay enough tuition as it is and that the university should be responsible for the costs of the renovation. </span></p>\n<p><b>CONTRASTS WITH OPPONENT:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho said that as a senator, he was the first to write and pass a bill during his term. He stressed that his collaboration with BCUs and active presence at their meetings would help him in the position of IVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel addressed his time management skills and work ethic. He talked about holding two jobs besides senator, but said he attended every senate meeting.

She also wants to create a program for sexual assault awareness training, similar to the one all Greek life members undergo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to reach out to students in I.V. and on campus to make them aware of what A.S. does and what resources are available to them. She would also like to work with the police in I.V. to mediate student relations and advocate for survivor-oriented sexual assault policies.</span></p>\n<p><b>POLICE PRESENCE IN I.V.:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico believes relying on UCIV, a volunteer group that offers assistance to partygoers during weekends, as student liaisons between students and police is the right step. She wants to move toward community policing because she believes the police presence in I.V. makes people uncomfortable.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to hold forums with police officers at least once a quarter to ease relations between students and officers. She also aims to create an environment where students feel comfortable reaching out to police for help.</span></p>\n<p><b>HALLOWEEN:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico believes Halloween in recent years has seen I.V. become a police state and said most people spend Halloween out of town. She wants to implement different events in I.V. so that students can enjoy Halloween in I.V. without partying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to work on opening up conversations, citing the CSD’s Deltopia Town Hall as an example of a productive discussion. She also wants to reach out to students who are usually not involved in these spaces and work with the CSD to ensure that student safety is the top priority. </span></p>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico cited her experience working as the CSD coordinator for the EVPLA office in which she was the liaison between the campus community and the CSD. She also helped the CSD implement a policy internship for students to give them experience in government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer spoke about her work canvassing for Measures E and F as well as her experience in Campus Democrats, which allowed her to make connections with Congressman Salud Carbajal as well as Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann. </span></p>\n<p><b>PARKING: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico spoke about her plan to utilize the width of I.V. streets to implement slanted parking on one side and parallel parking on the other, which would open up many more parking spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to maximize the space in I.V. that is already available as well as work with the future A.S. President to make on-campus parking cheaper so commuter students avoid parking in I.V. and taking up spaces for I.V. residents. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Active campaigning for all candidates began on Thursday.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are the candidate’s priorities and plans if elected:</span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nagpal wants to decrease indirect student costs and work to expand the Textbook Buyback Program so students get 80 percent of their money back.

id=\"caption-attachment-72474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The memorandum of understanding will guarantee admission for all qualified transfer students from California Community Colleges, increasing the number of students at all nine UC campuses. Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>University of California President Janet Napolitano signed a joint agreement with California Community College Chancellor Eloy Ortiz Oakley to put forth a “comprehensive effort” to guarantee admission for qualified transfer students to all nine UC campuses.</p>\n<p>The memorandum of understanding (MOU), signed on April 11, will increase the number of Californians who pursue higher education, Oakley said in a press release.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said this collaboration with the community college system will allow for a “streamlined” transfer process for qualified students as well as prepare them for transitioning to the UC System.</p>\n<p>According to Napolitano, the UC system hopes to implement these changes and see the “tangible, positive” effects by Fall 2019.</p>\n<p>The agreement would guarantee a place in the UC system for transfer students who complete one of the UC pathways and earn the necessary grade point average (GPA). The UC transfer pathway is a roadmap that outlines courses that community college students should take to establish themselves as competitive candidates for transferring.</p>\n<p>Transfer Admission Guarantees (T.A.G.s) that already exist between students and each university will still be in place, according to the memorandum.</p>\n<p>UCSB already has a “campus-specific guarantee” in place to accommodate community college transfer students, but will “continue to work closely with transfer students to explain their options for enrolling into our guaranteed program,” said UCSB Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop.</p>\n<p>The MOU states the UC Academic Senate — in conjunction with the California Community Colleges Senate — agreed to accept students who earn an associate degree at a community college where their degree “meets or exceeds the major requirements in a UC transfer pathway for the same major.”</p>\n<p>Julie Bruno, president of the Academic Senate for CCC, emphasized the importance of students earning their associate’s degree in addition to successfully transferring to a UC.</p>\n<p>The MOU sets forth several partnerships and programs to help community college students —particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds — meet the academic standards necessary for UC admission.</p>\n<p>Partnerships to enhance transfer students’ preparation for enrollment in the UC system include a UC campus summer program for prospective transfers and summer bridge programs for admitted students.</p>\n<p>The agreement highlights the importance of prioritizing transfer students and argues that this is a responsibility shared among all institutions of higher education.</p>\n<p>One of the actions outlined in the MOU calls for increased training for faculty to help them better serve transfer students and understand their specific needs.</p>\n<p>The most recent MOU builds upon previous MOUs, particularly one from 1996 that led to an increase in enrollment of CCC students by over 50 percent. In the last four admission cycles alone, the UC increased its transfer enrollment by 20 percent, reaching an all-time high of 20,000 transfer students in Fall 2017, according to the MOU.</p>\n<p>The agreement says the UC Academic Senate will be responsible for reporting annual data regarding the admissions guarantees to the UC Board of Regents in order to better ensure accountability. This data will also be used to amend the MOU to better meet its objectives.</p>\n<p>The agreement is set to be initiated immediately with the expectation that all relevant efforts will be carried out by the end of the academic year 2021-22, according to the MOU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Their request to the county to use the Solar Lot on Embarcadero Del Mar as alternative parking was also rejected.</p>\n<p>CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt said after identifying that the university was financially responsible for the fencing on El Colegio Road as opposed to the Santa Barbara County, the board put in a request with the university to avoid putting up fencing in response to the demands of the community.</p>\n<p>“We put in the request and essentially never heard back,” Brandt said. “A couple of us, myself included, feel very disillusioned by the fact that the university is not willing to listen to a bunch of concerned community members.”</p>\n<p>University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said fencing had been installed on El Colegio Road despite the motion that the CSD passed.</p>\n<p>“In the interest of public safety and traffic concerns, and in consultation with county officials and law enforcement, the decision was made to once again use the fencing during the weekend,” Estrada said when asked why the CSD’s request was denied.</p>\n<p>University Board appointee George Thurlow referenced two incidents in Santa Barbara in which pedestrians were killed in car accidents while jaywalking to explain why the university and UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) chief of police were adamant about installing the fences.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the discussion, it was concluded that that fence needed to be there, and if it saves one life, then it was worth it,” Thurlow said.</p>\n<p>The board had previously contacted the university to ask about the cost of fencing and were only told that it was a “substantial amount of money,” according to Brandt.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he believes the university is keeping the figure under wraps because the high price tag would upset residents who already oppose the fencing.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s disheartening because we do a lot of work to try to change the character of these events and make them so they are more community-based so that they are something that is safe for all community members,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt said there are better alternatives the university could promote, such as UCIV, a student-run volunteer program that has been developed in the past three years.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he believes UCIV would be able to “ensure that the event is safe on a peer-to-peer level in a way that law enforcement has failed to be able to do.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen a volunteer program just spring up out of nowhere, totally student-led, that really wants to try to dull down the number of people that are interacting with law enforcement, that are being arrested and being cited,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt also spoke about the importance of peer-to-peer relationships between students and CSOs, saying he felt the motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station during Deltopia is a positive step.</p>\n<p>He said he believes it’s important for the CSOs to be the “eyes and ears” of the community during events like this, when residents might not feel comfortable approaching law enforcement personnel with critical information.</p>\n<p>Plans regarding the creation of alternative parking for residents living on Del Playa Drive, Sabado Tarde Road and Trigo Road were halted after the Santa Barbara County Community Services Department rejected the board’s request to use the Pardall Solar Parking Lot, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He also said the County was “concerned about the loss of revenue” if the parking lot was used by residents of impacted streets for free.</p>\n<p>Thurlow said the board was working with Transportation &amp; Parking Services in order to create alternative parking, particularly with concerns for students who use their cars to get to their jobs.</p>\n<p>Originally, it was assumed that only Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road would have restricted parking. Brandt then found out on April 4 that parking on Trigo Road would also be controlled and that parking would not be permitted within 100 feet of the barricades.</p>\n<p>“There’s certain areas where we put no parking, like Trigo Road. The vehicles there will get towed because that street is going to get shut down,” Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) Lieutenant Juan Camarena said. “Everywhere else our recommendation is not to park, but if you park we’re not going to tow it like last year.”</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the city of Goleta, all vehicles in the area from Hollister Ave. to the southern city limit and from Cannon Green Drive to Storke Road without an approved permit will be subjected to a ticket. Parking lots on campus will also be restricted. Daytime parking will only be available for vehicles with the appropriate permits visible; vehicles parked on campus overnight without proper authorization will be impounded and given a $300 fine.</p>\n<p>Both Lieutenants Camarena and David Millard of UCPD attended the Deltopia town hall last month. At the town hall, Lieutenant Camarena said the UCPD and IVFP planned to closely monitor social media and adjust the amount of law enforcement present during Deltopia accordingly.</p>\n<p>Millard and Camarena said that they were not aware of any such monitoring when asked about efforts regarding plans to observe social media platforms for any posts related to Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I can’t say that I actually even heard that they were doing it this year,” Millard said.</p>\n<p>UCPD and IVFP currently have no plans to adjust the projected level of police presence during Deltopia, regardless of the weather, according to IVFP Deputy James McKarrel.</p>\n<p>“Rain or shine we will be staffed because it’s easier for us to reduce our units if we don’t need them then to bring them in if we do need them,” McKarrel said.</p>\n<p>Camarena estimated that there may be “around 60 to 70 officers” out during Deltopia, but could not give an exact number.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be similar to last year,” Camarena said.</p>\n<p>Millard also could not give an exact number of officers and said the department won’t know how many they will deploy until the day of the event because “officers may get sick or have family emergencies.”</p>\n<p>Camarena also said IVFP would not bring in horses during Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“This is my first year as a lieutenant for Deltopia, and the whole thing for me is just another day for us,” he said. “We just need to make sure that people are safe.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
