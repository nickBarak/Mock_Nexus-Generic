Yet the manifestation of this is so vastly different between the groups it’s almost jarring to see them on the same bill. The Glitch Mob is all aggressive machinery — a visual aesthetic borrowed from the film Blade Runner and the Fallout series of games, a musical aesthetic borrowed from Metallica. In contrast, Chromeo’s ’80s nostalgia synth-pop is all danceable grooves and lover boy sentimentality — an aesthetic much more human than machine. Yet somehow they complimented each other well, and along with supporting act Com Truise, delivered a fun and funky evening this Saturday at the Bowl.</p>\n<p>It was still sunny and warm for Com Truise’s opening set at 6:30. Dressed in black with his signature combination of tightly cropped hair and full beard, the producer deployed groovy computer pop confections for the still meager crowd. Though most of the audience early enough for his set seemed more interested in securing good spots for the following acts, Com Truise delivered a sonically delightful performance.</p>\n<p>Bass-y rumbles began to emanate from the stage almost as soon as the New Jersey-based producer walked off it. The atmospheric sounds built and layered upon each other as Com Truise’s equipment was removed to reveal a large, mysterious structure covered in a black sheet. As the noise reached a crescendo, the sheet was dramatically thrown off to release a cloud of smoke and reveal “The Blade” — The Glitch Mob’s “interactive instrument and art installation.” The Blade features three stations outfitted with MIDI controls and iPads, as well as machine-like “drums” to the rear. These allow the Mob to actually <em>play</em> their music live and switch roles and instruments mid-song.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’ve seen The Glitch Mob five times, and every single time, they have a totally different set-up,” Don Lucas, a UCSB alumnus attending the show, said. “That’s one of the reasons I love seeing them. And what they’ve got now, with The Blade, it’s completely unique. No one else has something like that.”</p>\n<p>Glitch Mob members edIT, Ooah and Boreta opened with their instantly recognizable “Mind of a Beast.” Behind them, a large screen displayed visuals choreographed to match each song. The Bowl’s extensive light set up was fully utilized from the get-go despite the fact that the sun was still up — the constant presence of theatrical smoke helped make the light show visible in spite of daylight.</p>\n<p>The crowd, initially unprepared for the sudden blast of lights and sound, started to get into it by the second song (“Our Demons”). An Egyptian-inspired statue of a hooded woman in space with lasers coming out of her eyes rotated and morphed on the screen. “Alright everyone, get your hands up! Let’s touch the sky!” Ooah shouted just before the song dropped.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara Bowl, you’re looking beautiful tonight,” Boreta proclaimed midway through the set. “This is my hometown, I grew up here. So this means a lot.” The crowd cheered appreciatively in reply.</p>\n<p>It was surprising to see only about a third of the audience dancing during most of Glitch Mob’s set. Though everyone seemed entranced by the spectacle of the performance, most of the crowd wasn’t interested in raging their faces off. This goes against what one might expect at a Glitch Mob show, but was not at all disappointing.</p>\n<p>A 30-minute intermission gave the crowd enough time to make it to the front of lines for drinks and food. After sunset, a sudden flurry of strobe lights, fog and sound announced the arrival of Chromeo. As the sound and strobes built, a three-syllable chant began: “Chrome-ee-oh, oh-oh” went the crowd, over and over. Then the duo broke into “Night By Night” for their first song.</p>\n<p>“Ooooooooh, what’s up Santa Barbara?” keyboardist P-Thugg (aka Patrick Gemayel) intoned in a synthesized robotic voice effect. “Can I hear you scream?” The crowd cheered, but apparently not loud enough for P-Thugg, who replied in his robot voice, “I said, can I hear you scre-eeeeeeeeam?” The crowd cheered wildly.</p>\n<p>Dressed in a leather jacket, black skinny jeans artfully ripped on one knee and tan suede shoes, singer/guitarist Dave 1 (aka David Macklovitch) is the attention-loving entertainer of the duo. He would come close to the crowd to solo for his adoring fans, jump all around the stage, feature pelvic gyrating prominently in his dance repertoire and talk frequently to the audience. P-Thugg, clad in flame print harem pants and a black sweatshirt, stayed mostly within the space between the five synths surrounding him. Occasionally he would leave it to play bass.</p>\n<p>Chromeo’s stage set-up featured three synthesizers for Dave 1 (in addition to P-Thugg’s five) and for each member, a pole-like structure containing drum pads and symbols. The two synths facing the audience were perched on light-up stands in the shape of women’s legs. The raised floor beneath them light up around the edges in a variable color scheme to match the stage lights, which was a cool effect. For every song the stage technicians pulled out all the stops with regard to the light show. During “Momma’s Boy,” a light was aimed at Dave 1’s reflective guitar to allow him to point it dramatically (and euphemistically) at audience members while he soloed.</p>\n<p>“I just want to give a shout out to the ladies on shoulders in the crowd right here” the guitarist said, smiling. “You know what guys, be courteous, find a girl nearby and pop her on your shoulders.” At Dave 1’s continued encouragement, most of the pit and a good portion of the seated sections were soon full of girls on shoulders.</p>\n<p>The crowd grooved and danced through every one of Chromeo’s songs. Never more so than during “Jealous,” arguably the catchiest song they have written to date. The crowd protested in surprise when Dave 1 and P-Thugg abruptly stepped off after “Jealous,” demanding an encore that, frankly, seemed certain to come.</p>\n<p>A few minutes of cheering at the empty stage and Chromeo returned to play “Fall Back 2U” for the delighted crowd. Dave 1 gave a shout-out to The Glitch Mob before closing with their first hit “Needy Girl,” accompanied by a rather overwhelming chaos of strobe lights.</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna Christina Cobos mentioned after the show that she attended primarily to see Chromeo. She was impressed with what the duo could do considering they were only two people and thought the light show was awesome. “Jealous” was her favorite song.</p>\n<p>Though the crowd seemed most enthusiastic toward Chromeo, all three acts gave excellent performances. Each transported the audience into their own unique retro-futuristic fantasy world, and as the best concerts do, allowed people to get lost in the experience.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhmUnk454MA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/","id":6939,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[6938,6937,6936],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Catalyst’ Art Fest Draws 900 to Food Co-op","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10835212_1008562429156764_1876760315783210922_o-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10835212_1008562429156764_1876760315783210922_o-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Catalyst Contemporary  Literary Arts Magazine curated yet another beautiful music and art fest this Tuesday at the I.V.

Lorenzo Basilio/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><em>The Catalyst Contemporary </em> <em>Literary Arts Magazine</em> curated yet another beautiful music and art fest this Tuesday at the I.V. Food Co-op. Becoming increasingly popular for their joyful celebration of I.V. creativity, past iterations of the event have served to kick off distribution of new <em>Catalyst</em> issues. This time, however, the magazine was promoting a kickstarter to fund its own future, having failed to secure a student lock-in fee. <em>The Catalyst</em> did not disappoint with what was possibly their most successful event yet.</p>\n<p>A full lineup of music, poetry and spoken word kept attendees entertained from 4 to 9:30. I.V. Food Co-op’s parking lot was transformed by the presence of art, crafts, live bands, face paint, caricatures, on-demand poetry and the general coming-together of Isla Vista creatives. The music lineup featured locals Pookie, Erisy Watt, Sun Daes and Dad Clothes, as well as L.A.-based headliners The End of Summer and UCSB alumni Bixler-Orion Sound System.</p>\n<p>Dad Clothes’ sunset timeslot enjoyed the biggest attendance of the evening. The setting sun blazing behind ornate tie-dye tapestries as the band played “American Girl” felt like something out of a Sofia Coppola movie.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I didn’t know so many people liked books,” keyboardist Evan Perlman joked between songs. “Good job, guys. Keep reading.”</p>\n<p>Bixler-Orion Sound System followed with their Flying Lotus-inspired beats.</p>\n<p>“I really like what they’re doing with the ambient vocals,” first-year English and physics major Jack Wallace mentioned. Obscure samples and trippy guitar and vocal loops characterized B.O.S.S.’s set.</p>\n<p>The End of Summer closed out the evening with a dream pop set that felt very appropriate for the atmosphere. After the show, drummer Oliver Dobrian said the band was happy to get involved “with such a cool event” and “just glad we could get people dancing.”</p>\n<p>Poetry and spoken word artists were featured in between musical acts. The entire evening was a hum of activity, with <em>Catalyst</em> members offering face paint, personalized typewriter poetry, caricatures, handmade wares like seaglass jewelry and issues of the magazine (for suggested donations). The atmosphere was positive as people mingled, danced and enjoyed the art and poetry.</p>\n<p>Wallace remarked, “It’s really cool to see the unique and vibrant members of our community coming out to share little pieces of themselves.”</p>\n<p>“Something I love about the I.V. community is that it really fosters creativity and collaboration; it’s a tight-knit community. Coming to events like this just inspires me so much to be creative,” second-year physics major Suzanna Ackroyd said.</p>\n<p>For over a year now, <em>The Catalyst </em>magazine and its events have done much to help rejuvenate I.V.’s creative scene. As the anniversary of last May’s tragic events leave I.V. somber, it’s important to remember the interconnection, resilience, activism and art that Isla Vista has and continues to produce. The fest provided a forum for Isla Vistans to come together and celebrate the creativity this community is capable of.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63943\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1400492962\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63940\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63943\" data-attachment-id=\"63943\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/catalyst-art-fest-draws-900-to-food-co-op/catalyst_lorenzo-basilio/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=2048%2C1368&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1368\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Catalyst_Lorenzo Basilio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-63943\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63943\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_63942\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2125421250\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63940\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63942\" data-attachment-id=\"63942\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/catalyst-art-fest-draws-900-to-food-co-op/catalyst_lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1368&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1368\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Catalyst_Lorenzo Basilio 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-63942\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Catalyst_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63942\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Of course, that includes our very own Santa Barbara Bowl. Glitch-hop idols, The Glitch Mob, will co-headline the bowl alongside Chromeo this Saturday, supported by vintage synth-freak Com Truise.</p>\n<p>Chromeo released their fourth studio album <em>White Women</em> last year, which climbed to the number one spot on the iTunes charts. The Canadian duo also performed at many festivals including Lollapalooza, Outside Lands and Sasquatch. Comprised of Dave 1 (David Macklovitch) and P-Thugg (Patrick Gemayel), Chromeo has become known and revered for their shiny ’80s revivalist electro-funk sound. The Hall &amp; Oats and Klymaxx on the duo’s musical tone is glaring. Churning out danceable tracks ever since the success of 2004’s breakout single “Needy Girl,” the pair has perfected an aesthetic of gleaming, plastic-y pastiche.</p>\n<p>2014 also proved fruitful for The Glitch Mob. Their long-awaited sophomore album <em>Love Death Immortality </em>debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart. On top of that, 2014 saw the completion of the group’s interactive instrument and art installation aptly titled the Blade. According to their website, the Blade “resembles a futuristic machine of violent design, with which they pair custom software that allows them to switch live roles on the fly, like a traditional rock band that — instead of swapping solos — can trade off entire instruments mid-song.” The new tech should make their live show a real treat.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The L.A.-based Glitch Mob is composed of edIT (Edward Ma), Boreta (Justin Boreta) and Ooah (Josh Mayer).

On his website, he compares himself to Joy Division, New Order and the Cocteau Twins, “but it’s like you’re hearing them through the motherboard of a waterlogged Xbox — demented and modern.”</p>\n<p>This exhibition of high-energy electrified soul music will surely induce involuntary jamming in even the most reserved concert-goers.

The vibes were positive and energetic as The Crash Landings started off the evening’s music.</p>\n<p>A mix of power pop, alt rock and punk tunes kept toes tapping throughout the set. Lead guitarist Michael De Maria managed to last almost four songs before breaking a string during one of his boisterous solos (a regular occurrence at their shows).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Yancellor Chang followed, riling up the crowd with a ska punk set. A guy double fisting beers attempted to deliver sips to bassist Sam Goff, who accepted, and drummer Gad Girling, who declined. Girling did, however, later acquiesce to the crowd’s chanted demand to take off his shirt. It was a moment worthy of quoting singer Patrick Therrien, “You know who loves some good nudity? Me. You know who else loves nudity? God.”</p>\n<p>Four Closure bassist Jacob Acosta maintained the slightly-clothed schemata by performing the entire set shirtless and barefoot. Four Closure, winners of this year’s UCSB Battle of the Bands, delivered a standout performance. Moh Dalloul’s blistering guitar solos and expressive style were a joy to experience, coupled with Acosta’s banter and unbelievable bass solos. Every member displayed impressive skill and the ability to feed off each other’s vibes to maintain a tight performance, all while exuding an air of relaxed charisma.</p>\n<p>“I had a great time. This is an awesome venue,” Four Closure second guitarist Mitch Grimes said after the show. When asked if he expects Amp’d Up Thursdays to draw crowds, he responded, “I hope so. Live music doesn’t get as much support these days, and it really needs it.” Sound engineer Charlie Mumbles thought the show was “super rocked out. I love the young crowd; we need more young cats in here.”</p>\n<p>Though the setting featured less thrashing and handle pulling than you might see at an I.V. house show, Amp’d Up Thursdays offered an upscale atmosphere and quality drinks that will never run out.

Her demeanor was so familiar and unassuming, yet commanded attention, like someone approaching a lunch table where all her friends sit waiting for her. In a taupe dress, pink patent sandals, white glasses and red lipstick, Ms. Salvant looked at once classic and unique.</p>\n<p>The packed house was comprised mostly of older Santa Barbara bohemians. Salvant’s manner and incredible musicianship had them eating from the palm of her hand from the start; every joke received uproarious laughter, every solo awed applause.</p>\n<p>After her first song, Salvant greeted the crowd in a feminine and surprisingly quiet speaking voice. This only made her more intriguing. As Salvant introduced her band, the crowd was like a group of school kids listening breathlessly to the girl with the latest gossip.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The singer informed us that the next song was about Cinderella’s stepsisters. Having spent hours preparing for the ball, they are ignored by the prince in favor of Cinderella and become absolutely consumed with envy. “So I thought the song was perfect for me,” Salvant said, to much laughter from the crowd. She kept the crowd laughing throughout the song with her mastery of theatrical delivery as she sang about the sisters’ desire to do physical harm to Cinderella. The multitude of attitudes Salvant could elicit from a single phrase was impressive.</p>\n<p>“The Stepsisters’ Lament” was followed by “John Henry.” As on her album, the song started with nothing but Salvant’s voice backed by a foot-tapping bass line. Then, the pianist added some bell-like notes as the drums started in, all softly at first and then growing in intensity. The song was visceral and enthralling. A fan in the audience, alumnus Bobbie Bush, enjoyed her “intriguing take on classical songs” and “well-rounded set list.”</p>\n<p>Salvant often stepped back from the mic to let her band take solos.  Pianist Aaron Diehl and bassist Paul Sikivie delivered masterfully. In these moments, the singer deferred attention totally to her band, receding from the spotlight and tapping her hand along to the beat.</p>\n<p>Salvant discussed her love of Bessie Smith, the “Empress of the Blues,” saying, “She used to sing all kinds of blues … and this one is about food.” The song was a hilarious jaunt full of food-related sexual innuendos, including gems like “I crave your round steak.”</p>\n<p>The Florida-born singer has an impressive resume for being just 25; she won the Thelonious Monk Jazz Competition in 2010 and received a Grammy nod for her album <i>WomanChild</i> in 2014. Her incredible voice and mastery of tone have earned many critical accolades and performances in prestigious venues across the nation.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and math double major Sydney Belcher was particularly impressed with Salvant’s range of both pitch and expression. “I loved when she sang really high and low and all the types of tones she could do,” Belcher said.</p>\n<p><strong>Salvant and her band received a standing ovation after their last song, a classic from “West Side Story<i>.</i>” The crowd continued applauding enthusiastically until they returned for an encore of “On The Street Where You Live” from “My Fair Lady.” Overall, Salvant delivered an extremely enjoyable performance; her musicianship and theatricality were brilliant, and her personality made the show feel authentic and personal. One hardly notices the time pass listening to Cécile McLorin Salvant. </strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61078\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/jazz-vocalist-cecile-salvant-gets-playful-at-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61078\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/jazz-vocalist-cecile-salvant-gets-playful-at-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/jazz-vocalist-cecile-salvant-gets-playful-at-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/jazz-vocalist-cecile-salvant-gets-playful-at-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/jazz-vocalist-cecile-salvant-gets-playful-at-campbell-hall/","id":7746,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[7745,7744,7743],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jazz Singer Gregory Porter Charmed Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  Campbell Hall buzzed with energy as a crowd waited for jazz singer Gregory Porter to take the stage.

Porter has generated an increasing amount of buzz lately; his 2014 Grammy win for Best Jazz Vocal Album only the latest in a stream of high recognition for his work. Given the singer’s reputation and the fact that he does not often play on the West Coast, this special performance brought by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures met a thrilled audience.</p>\n<p>The stage lights went up on Porter’s band: pianist Chip Crawford, bassist Aaron James, drummer Emanuel Harrold and saxophonist Yosuke Sato all looked suave in neutral-toned suits as they played up-tempo jazz. Applause erupted when Porter strode coolly onstage and took the mic.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The California native’s rich baritone voice poured forth like honey whiskey, his tone and delivery intoxicating. He wore a grey jacket over a light green vest along with his signature black cap. After a few bluesy verses, Sato took off on a lofty solo that immediately established his impressive sax chops. Crawford followed with a classical-inspired piano solo. The crowd whooped and cheered as the song climaxed into Porter’s passionate vocals.</p>\n<p>After proper band introductions, a riotous bebop tune discharged. Sato and Crawford delivered rollicking solos that had audience members calling out in delight. A man in the back far right of the audience shouted comments like “yeah, sing it!”</p>\n<p>“For this next one, I’m gonna ask you guys to sing along, kinda like that guy is already doing,” Porter joked. “Yeah I see you man, I see you.” Back Right Guy proceeded to sing a very audible harmony atop the call-and-response chorus of the next song. But it didn’t come off as rude. Rather, adding one’s voice in this way seemed to be encouraged.</p>\n<p>Porter then got the audience clapping enthusiastically to the grooving beat of “Liquid Spirit,” the title track from his latest album. Others in the crowd started calling out with emotion during particularly powerful moments. The fourth wall receded more and more as the night went on.</p>\n<p>A highlight of the show came when Porter sang two slow blues verses a cappella. His superb voice and affecting delivery sent shivers down the spine. Suddenly his lyrics melted into a drumroll and the transition filled the room with anticipatory energy.  Harrold then broke into the best drum solo this reporter has ever seen, at once primal and modern, and extremely satisfying.</p>\n<p>The whole band exuded passion and control in their playing. Emotive facial expressions accompanied impressive feats of musical skill. Throughout the performance, sophistication commingled with rousing music and audience participation, two qualities that do not generally lend themselves to a refined atmosphere.</p>\n<p>One self-described former “jazz head” in attendance, who wished to remain anonymous, said the show was quite different than the ones he used to see. He mentioned that he had expected a bit more “coherent behavior” from the band, referring to the abundant amount of soloing. He was impressed with the skill of all the performers despite this, particularly Porter and Sato.</p>\n<p>“Peace and love y’all, thanks so much,” Porter said before strolling offstage with a wave and a smile. The audience applauded wildly and gave him a standing ovation as the band continued to play. After a few minutes, he came back and performed several more songs. When he strode off for a second time, the audience rose again in another standing ovation, this time clapping to the beat. The show ended with a satisfying bass solo from James.</p>\n<p>Gregory Porter and his band delivered an exceptional performance last Thursday. It was everything one hopes a concert will be; moving and entertaining with the occasional spine-chill. In this reporter’s humble opinion, the hype about Gregory Porter is well-deserved.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/jazz-singer-gregory-porter-charmed-campbell-hall/","id":7724,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[7723,7722,7721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ukulele Wiz Jake Shimabukuro Plays UCSB’s Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Jake Shimabukuro holds many accolades, the least of which is being one of the first videos to go viral on YouTube.

His rendition of George Harrison’s “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” entitled “Ukulele Weeps,” garnered millions of views after it was posted on the site without his knowledge. A quick glance at the comments section demonstrates how impactful that video was. Messages like, “8 years later, it’s still one of my favorites” appear regularly. But it’s not just his incredible talent at the ukulele that keeps people coming back. Shimabukuro possesses an inherent likeableness and pure sincerity that was on full display during his performance at Campbell Hall last Thursday, Oct. 23.</p>\n<p>Based on the excitement of the crowd, it seemed Shimabukuro is well-known and well-liked in Santa Barbara. Energetic chatter and a general air of excitement danced in the audience. The crowd was built up of mostly older, well-dressed adults, but they were as excited as any kid about to see a great concert.</p>\n<p>The show began with a single light upon Shimabukuro, who strummed his ukulele serenely. Bassist Nolan Verner joined in to add some subtle low-end. Four tree-like stands holding stage lights rotated 360 degrees and flashed an impressive array of colors. These were used throughout the show to add an extra element of visual interest. As the song built up in complexity, more and more lights were added, changing color and rotating with the melody. The lights added emotional tone to each song throughout the concert</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Shimabukuro greeted the crowd with an, “Aloha, Santa Barbara!” to enthusiastic applause. It was clear he was as excited to be there performing as the crowd was to see him. He made shout-outs to many people throughout the night, including Arts &amp; Lectures management, donors, friends and family and the chefs at Arigato Sushi, all by name.</p>\n<p>“We did 140 shows in 140 cities this year,” he said. “It’s nice to have some cities that you really look forward to. Santa Barbara is one of those.” The affection was mutual; the crowd adored him and cheered ecstatically after every song.</p>\n<p>Shimabukuro’s energy was positively infectious. He jumped around the stage and made expressive faces as he played, entertaining the crowd with his antics. He fist-bumped Verner after almost every song and even fist-bumped the stage manager when he came out to give Shimabukuro a different ukulele. It was clear he was genuinely enjoying himself.</p>\n<p>The first handful of songs was mostly upbeat, original arrangements featuring both Shimabukuro and Verner. The combination of bass and ukulele produced a gorgeous, full-bodied sound. At one point, the ukulele master used a loop pedal to record himself playing a reverb-tinged chord progression, and then soloed over it with a screaming, guitar-like distorted sound on his ukulele. The lights flashed frantically as the crowd cheered for his impressive finger work.</p>\n<p>The middle of the set featured Shimabukuro on his own, playing a host of more traditional songs from genres around the world. These included traditional Japanese and Hawaiian tunes, as well as jazz standards. Shimabukuro’s skill and musicianship was undeniable.</p>\n<p>Verner rejoined Shimabukuro onstage for the last several songs. These were more modern and upbeat arrangements and included a cover of “In My Life” by The Beatles. Before the last song, Shimabukuro took the time to thank the crowd (again) for being there and supporting the arts.</p>\n<p>“Music isn’t just a universal language,” he said, “it’s the language of the universe.” He talked at length about the importance of music education, saying, “I’ve been drug-free my whole life and it’s because of this instrument.” He then closed the night with his famous cover of “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” which earned a standing ovation from the crowd.</p>\n<p>The musical skill Shimabukuro demonstrated was breathtaking. Even more impressive, however, was his obvious passion for making people happy. This is an artist who truly believes in the power of music to change people’s lives, and who aims to bring that transformative power to his audiences. Perhaps it was this sincerity that the millions of people drawn to his 2006 video were (and still are) responding to.

Devon McNaughton//<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>Legends of LA’s traffic abound far and wide, yet the drive down PCH to Santa Monica’s Way Over Yonder festival was shockingly painless on its opening day. The weather was a perfect, breezy 75 degrees. The ocean glittered so invitingly that it was tempting to forsake the opening acts in favor of a swim.</p>\n<p>Luckily, WOY made it easy for attendees to busy themselves with attractions outside the festival grounds. Don’t expect the kind of self-sufficient mini world other festivals attempt to create; WOY is instead integrated within the already-fun atmosphere of the Santa Monica pier.</p>\n<p>The grounds were relatively small and contained few dining options. Given the wealth of delicious food and entertainment available immediately outside, the few options made sense. Attendees could easily come and go throughout the day with hardly any lines until the closing acts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The entire festival was characterized by a laid-back vibe. The crowds were never rowdy, the bar area was mellow and many of the performances felt casual. The folk genre lends well to this atmosphere and to another aspect of WOY that stood out: intimacy. There were maybe a thousand attendees at the biggest acts. There were only two stages; one main stage that dominated the festival and a much smaller one inside the carousel house. The carousel stage featured intimate, acoustic performances, but even at the main stage you could get pretty close to the performers and run a good chance of seeing them around the festival later.</p>\n<p>Minutes after entering, in fact, I ran into loop pedal virtuoso Moses Sumney, who would perform later that day. He was extremely sweet and friendly as we chatted about WOY and his upcoming performance.</p>\n<p>“I love the venue,” he said, mentioning that he came last year as an attendee. “It’s beautiful and the weather is just kinda perfect.”</p>\n<p>I first heard of Sumney when he opened for Australian future soul band Hiatus Kaiyote last year, an experience he described as “brain melting.” He said he became good friends with the group and lauded them as “the heaviest soul band out there right now.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bootstraps opened the festival at the main stage to a predictably small crowd. Dreamy, sustained guitar and glittery synth wafted from the stage as the group played with a decent amount of energy for how meager the crowd was. Their set suffered from some sound issues that were not uncommon throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>Alternative country band The Far West followed at the carousel stage. In the small space, the crowd felt larger than that of Bootstraps, and was certainly more enthusiastic. Clever songwriting, undeniable chops and an authentic charm characterized their performance.</p>\n<p>In particular, frontman Lee Briante possessed a certain effortless charisma that won over the crowd. I ran into him later and asked about his musical history. He listed his parents as big influences, saying they were true music lovers and had great taste, introducing him to the likes of Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan and Little Feat.</p>\n<p>Houndmouth, a four-piece alt-country group from Indiana, played the second set at the main stage to a crowd heavily dominated by college kids. Their indie rock and country sound was a unique mix I hadn’t heard before, and it was nice to see a woman on the stage for the first time that weekend.</p>\n<p>The group rocked catchy three-part harmonies, and frontman Matt Myers impressed the crowd with bluesy guitar solos. My personal favorite part of the set, though, was Katie Toupin’s switch from keyboard to guitar and lead vocals on several songs. Houndmouth also played WOY’s sister festival, Newport Folk, earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Moses Sumney stood out as the least conventionally folk act of the weekend. He used his voice and guitar to create loops and then sang over them in his Frank Ocean-esque croon, while another guitarist added subtle ornamentation. Sumney seemed endearingly shy onstage. His sparse, mellow tunes were met with great appreciation from the crowd and were a nice soundtrack to the setting sun.</p>\n<p>Folk heavyweight Lucinda Williams saw an exponential increase in attendance from preceding acts at the main stage. She has built a deserved reputation for meticulously crafted Americana tunes and sounded just as good live as on her records. The mostly older crowd was a bit subdued, and her demeanor onstage was regrettably stiff, but technically the performance was excellent.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56400\" style=\"width: 176px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56400\" data-attachment-id=\"56400\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/p1020748/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020748.jpg?fit=2520%2C3776&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2520,3776\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"DMC-LX7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1380225790\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"4.7\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"P1020748\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020748.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020748.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56400 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1020748-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" alt=\"Little Hurricane performs on the carousel stage at Way Over Yonder.

Devon McNaughton//<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>The last act to grace the carousel stage on Friday, Little Hurricane, delivered a lively set of bluesy tunes reminiscent of the Black Keys. They laid out a funky carpet and vintage end table onstage, making the already intimate show feel like it was taking place in someone’s home. The crowd fed off the energy of their performance and danced more than at any other peformance at the carousel stage. Drummer Celeste Spina wore an exhilarated smile for the entire show that was impossible not to mirror.</p>\n<p>Making my way back to the main stage area, I witnessed the first long line of the day as people scrambled to catch Local Natives. It was apparent that many concert-goers bought tickets just for this moment. Additional lights were set up and they came on 15 minutes late, just long enough for the crowd to get antsy.</p>\n<p>Older people and country fans who had stuck around to check them out absconded after a few songs, leaving a crowd of adoring, but subdued hipsters. Moses Sumney’s guest appearance for a Little Dragon cover was a highlight. Overall, Local Natives’ psychedelic-tinged indie rock made for a satisfying end to day one.</p>\n<p>Day two saw the festival grow significantly more crowded. Joe Pug’s set at the carousel stage had the highest attendance of any I saw there; he seemed to be a local favorite. Though solo acoustic singer-songwriter isn’t exactly an original concept, Joe Pug is good at what he does. His Dylan-esque vocals were impeccable, his delivery personal and affecting.</p>\n<p>Following Pug was surprise highlight Linda Perhacs. To my initial confusion, I entered the carousel house only to find half the crowd sitting cross-legged like school kids at story time. But I soon realized this was the proper way to enjoy her music and I joined them.</p>\n<p>Her psychedelic brand of folk is difficult to describe, but it involves three-part harmonies, trippy vocal effects, acoustic guitar and synth pads. Perhacs, an adorable older lady with a kindly schoolteacher’s voice, had the crowd mesmerized.</p>\n<p>In opposition to Perhacs, Heartless Bastards’ set did not live up to my expectations. Though the band played well, frontwoman Erika Wennerstrom seemed slightly aggravated for most of the show. Several times she interrupted songs to yell at the sound crew, killing the vibe. Her mysteriously uncomfortable stage presence made it difficult to connect with the music.</p>\n<p>Jackson Browne closed out the weekend well with his quintessentially “folk” classics. Browne is a favorite of the Newport Folk Festival, of which he said, “it’s nice there, but it’s nicer here,” a high compliment.</p>\n<p>His no-frills set mixed old standards with new tunes from his forthcoming album, and the crowd adored him. He forgot a verse to “These Days” (one of his biggest hits) and said with a laugh, “I’ve forgotten a lot of words in my time, but never the words to that song,” to which the crowd cheered.</p>\n<p>The casual atmosphere, intimate performances and vibrant location of WOY set it apart from any other festival I’ve been to. The ease with which one can leave the revelry to enjoy Santa Monica prevents burnout and keeps the experience fresh. However, it has the potential to discourage attendees from discovering new bands, since watching an act you’ve never heard of might seem dull in comparison to a dip in the ocean or a ride at the nearby amusement park.</p>\n<p>WOY rewarded those who stuck around with a lineup of diverse and (mostly) excellent acts that were a joy to experience against the idyllic backdrop of the pier. Did Way Over Yonder succeed in having the influence of its sister festival, Newport Folk? Not really. Did it succeed in putting on a really fun weekend? Absolutely.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story originally appeared on page 12 of Thursday, October 2, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/local-natives-headline-way-over-yonder/","id":7560,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[7559,7558,7557],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Way Over Yonder Festival To Bring Folk Music to Santa Monica","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Way Over Yonder, self-described “younger cousin” of the Newport Folk Festival, will bring a variety of music acts to the iconic Santa Monica Pier this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Way Over Yonder, self-described “younger cousin” of the Newport Folk Festival, will bring a variety of music acts to the iconic Santa Monica Pier this weekend.</p>\n<p>The Newport Folk Festival famously spurred the careers of several beloved artists including Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, and Way Over Yonder aims to bring that tradition the West Coast. The festival will span over Friday and Saturday evening, headlined by Jackson Browne and Local Natives. Supporting acts include Lucinda Williams, Chris Robinson Brotherhood, Jamestown Revival and Heartless Bastards.</p>\n<p>Jackson Browne’s authentic, soul-baring classics promise to appeal as much to millennials in the audience as to baby-boomers who grew up listening to him.

The recent Extravaganza headliners are sure to play an exciting set of their psychedelic-influenced tunes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lineup as a whole represents a wide spectrum of artists falling under the category of “folk”. Folk’s central characteristics have always been hotly contested, making a definition that is difficult to pin down, but Way Over Yonder embraces this variability. Artists must have some roots in the tradition of the travelling American singer-songwriter in order to be considered for the festival, but they are not required to be strictly definable as folk. Way Over Yonder takes pride in following the footsteps of the Newport Folk Festival by expanding the definition of the genre. As a result, even veteran folk fans are sure to hear something new this weekend.</p>\n<p>As far as locations go, it’s difficult to imagine a more idyllic one than the Santa Monica Pier. Festival attendees will be treated with views of the Pacific Ocean just beyond the view of their favorite band. The pier contains its own amusement park, as well as many popular restaurants and shops. There will also be food vendors and several bars within the festival.</p>\n<p>With its strong lineup and enviable location, there is little more one could ask from this festival. Way Over Yonder promises a weekend of good American music and good American fun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Visit </em><a href=\"http://www.wayoveryonder.net/\">wayoveryonder.net/</a><em> for tickets and more information.</em></p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56230\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56230\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/way-over-yonder-festival-to-bring-folk-music-to-santa-monica/","id":7099,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[7098,7097,7096],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/741"}},"__N_SSG":true}
