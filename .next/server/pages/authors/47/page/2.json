\r\n</script> \n<p>Losing two close games in a row has the possibility to be detrimental to the team morale if the roster doesn’t maintain mentally tough.</p>\n<p>“The upperclassmen have a responsibility to make sure that doesn’t happen with the young kids, because the upperclassmen know it’s a long season and we can only control what we can control,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We’ve got to look at it as a staff and as a program and the upperclassmen see it more clearly than the young kids do. It’s about ‘what did we do? What happened?’ When you lose, don’t lose the lesson.”</p>\n<p>This weekend, Santa Barbara will be playing in the annual Hilton Concord Classic tournament on Friday and Saturday, facing two worthy opponents – Saint Mary’s of California and (2-1) and University of Alabama Birmingham (3-0).</p>\n<p>“I’ll start working on Saint Mary’s and I’m going to have to sneak a peek at UAB, because we can’t just turn that over overnight,” Henrickson said. “Some of the stuff they run offensively, both teams play man so that helps us, we’re not having to work on man and zone [defense]. And some of the things that UAB runs, we have defended already. But obviously our primary focus is to get ready for Saint Mary’s because we’ve got our hands full because they’re a really talented team.”</p>\n<p>The first opponent, Saint Mary’s, is coming off a dominating 82-64 home win versus Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Sydney Raggio finessed her way to her second double-double of the season, scoring a game-high 23 points and grabbing a whooping 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>SMC has been an offensively powerful team, winning their last two games after opening up their season with a loss. A pivotal aspect of their wins has been a strong offensive presence in the first quarter, bursting on the court with shot after short, setting the pace for the game and giving themselves a nice lead.</p>\n<p>The Gaels hurdled their way to an early 11-5 lead in the first quarter against the Cougars, and went on a 9-0 run in the first quarter to go up at 11-5 versus the Broncos. They won both games by over 5 points or more.</p>\n<p>“Saint Mary’s is a lot of ball reversals, with at least [probably] two to three on-ball screens –what they run offensively, so we’ve started to look at that already.” Coach Henrickson enlightened.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to keep their foot on the gas against the offensively aggressive home team, being careful not to give up a lead like they did against The Redhawks, or fall behind too early as was the case against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>Being that it is a tournament, though, the next opponent on UCSB’s itinerary is another commanding challenger.</p>\n<p>The Blazers, the second UCSB opponent of the event, is coming in hot with a currently undefeated record of 3-0.</p>\n<p>The University of Alabama at Birmingham has crushed each of their last three adversaries, winning each game by a large margin of 10 points or more.</p>\n<p>Their most recent faceoff was against the Miles Golden Bears, in which UAB held their foes to only 2 points in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The home team Blazers utilized a vicious well-adjusted game plan consisting of both intense offense and suffocating defense. They dominated the paint by scoring a notable 40 points to Miles’ 14, while also outrebounding the Golded Bears, 43-to-31.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Rachael Childress was in attack mode, chalking up 14 points to lead the Blazers in scoring.</p>\n<p>UAB has not scored less than 13 points in any quarter in all of their last three games.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team will need to make sure they stay firm on defense, hard-hitting on offense, and remain fundamentally sound, in order to overcome the well-rounded force of the Blazers.</p>\n<p>The quick turnaround from one game to another is not something to be taken lightly, but the factor of the unknown is not an issue.</p>\n<p>“The good thing for us is, we know it’s UAB. We know it’s not the winner of UAB or Indiana. It’s good that we know it’s UAB from a prep standpoint, cause to try and prepare for three teams right now, would be difficult for us and challenging, for as young as we are. So, we might sneak in some stuff on Wednesday [at practice] that might be different for us, that we haven’t seen.”</p>\n<p>According to Henrickson, her practices with the Gauchos are very tough, and is where she really pushes her players to see what they can do. She stressed that the disbursement of player minutes and standout bench play is going to be critical throughout the tournament, especially with such a young team.</p>\n<p>“It’s about production. Players earn minutes in practice. Our bench has to be ready to produce. We’ve got a strong bench and we’re very confident in that.”</p>\n<p>The youth of the team, along with the offensive woes of Santa Barbara, will all be put to the test this weekend.</p>\n<p>UCSB will first face-off against the Saint Mary Gaels this Friday, Nov. 24. And will then go head-to-head with the UAB Blazers on Saturday, Nov. 25.</p>\n<p>Both games in the tournament will take place in Moraga, California at McKeon Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Suddenly, UCSB found themselves down 11 points with 8:18 left in the fourth and would have to gouge their way back if they wanted a shot at winning the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued to have turnover woes, with two turnovers early in the final frame preventing them from gaining any headway.</p>\n<p>Powerfully pursuing the challenge of fighting an uphill battle, halfway through the fourth quarter, Santa Barbara began to gallop back into the game, offsetting their scoring struggles with a 9-2 scoring clinic as time dwindled down just under five minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>The visiting Gauchos grew electrifyingly aggressive on defense as the quarter went on, with a series of great defensive stands resulting in UCSB taking four charges down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Down eight with 2:26 to go, the Gauchos rallied off five straight points to cut the score to 61-64 with just under 36 seconds left thanks to a surge led by yet another Bates three-pointer and topped off with a clutch layup by redshirt Junior guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Porter’s layup, things seemed to be going Santa Barbara’s way, as after an intentional foul by the Gauchos, the Broncos junior guard Dru Toleafoa proceeded to miss both free throws giving the visiting team the opportunity to tie the game up in the next possession.</p>\n<p>However, the anticipated late-quarter comeback was immediately put to rest when the Gauchos had a calamitous turnover by freshman guard Danae Miller on the inbounds play. UCSB tried to continue playing the foul game but to no avail as its fate was sealed losing its first game of the season, 68-63.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 45.8 percent on 22 for 48 shooting, while the home team shot at a better 47.1 percent on 24 for 51 shooting.</p>\n<p>21 Gaucho turnovers had a massive impact on the outcome of the game, as there were too many giveaways late in the game for Santa Barbara to recover. Each mistake proved to be more costly than the last, as Santa Clara scored 19 points off those turnovers.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman had another consistent high scoring game. Edelman was the lone Gaucho to score in double figures and led all scorers with 23 points, and grabbed a team-leading six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Though the Broncos’ leading scorer Wolph was inactive for the game they still had weapons to rely upon as senior guard Kyla Martin and Toleafoa both had double-digit nights with 17 points each to overshadow Santa Barbara and Edelman’s solid offensive night to come away with their first win of the new campaign.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Santa Clara both had five wins apiece in the history of these two programs, but it is the Broncos now who holds the all-time lead thus far, 6-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be back on the court at 7 pm this Friday, Nov. 17 as they faceoff against Seattle University in the Thunderdome for their first home game of the season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/gauchos-late-rally-fails-drops-road-match-at-santa-clara/","id":215,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[214,213,212],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Road Journey Continues at Santa Clara","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-15-at-1.09.56-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-15-at-1.09.56-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Time away from Santa Barbara continues as the UCSB women's basketball team will take on Santa Clara in hopes of improving to 2-0.

Their most recent faceoff with the Broncos was in the 2016-2017 season, which resulted in a 69-58 loss for the Gauchos at home.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has not defeated Santa Clara since Nov. 23, 2013 while on the road.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 48.5 percent on 33-for-68 shooting against Northern Arizona last game, with four Gauchos scoring in double-digits. Freshman guard Sarah Bates led the team with a commanding 25 points, helping keep UCSB’s offensive success afloat.</p>\n<p>To replicate another win, UCSB will need to come out with the same firepower, as was the case against the Lumberjacks. The Gauchos shot 7-for- 9 from three-point range in the first quarter and 14-for-30 from downtown overall.</p>\n<p>Despite the Gauchos’ offensive surge beyond the arc – defensively, they seemed sparse.</p>\n<p>Allowing the Lumberjacks to score on 47.4 percent shooting, the Gauchos woefully permitted Northern Arizona to score 14 points off 11 turnovers, and was beat by NAU on the boards.</p>\n<p>Defense will be a key factor in the bout against Santa Clara, as the Broncos established a strong defensive presence against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara forced 20 turnovers and tallied 16 steals in its matchup against the Titans. Santa Barbara will need to be cautious when in possession of the ball as the Broncos scored 22 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>A crucial player for the Broncos to look out for will be Santa Clara junior guard Emily Wolph, who is fresh off a career-high 27-point game.</p>\n<p>In addition to Wolph, the Broncos have found a way to share the wealth as a result of other players scoring. Senior guards Taylor Berry (14), Kyla Martin (11), and senior forward Morgan McGwire (11) all scored double digits in the Broncos’ loss to Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Broncos loss to the Titans at home was highlighted by a 7-minute scoreless stretch in the fourth quarter. It will be essential for the visiting Gauchos to take advantage of such stretches if they occur by being assertive offensively.</p>\n<p>UCSB goes into the game having lost the rebound battle between itself and Northern Arizona (38-43). An advantage on the boards could ignite success for the Gauchos considering that Santa Clara only recorded 28 rebounds against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>An opportunity to win the battle on the boards could translate into the extension of possessions which turns into buckets.</p>\n<p>Bench play will also have an enormous impact on the game, as UCSB’s bench outscored the Lumberjacks 26-14. Santa Clara had subpar production from its bench last game, only scoring 15 as a unit.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos undeniably have more depth than the Broncos. During their last game, Santa Clara had three players well over 30 minutes of playing time, while UCSB only had two players who scarcely played over half an hour.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has to be sure to exploit Santa Clara’s endurance and keep the momentum in its favor by using the depth of its roster in hopes of out hustling the opposing team.</p>\n<p>UCSB will go head-to-head with Santa Clara at the Leavey Center on Tuesday, Nov. 14 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79673\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79673\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-14/ucsbs-road-journey-continues-at-santa-clara/","id":657,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[656,655,654],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Boston Business: Welcome to the Winner’s Circle","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sports2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sports2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Known for its winning history, the city of Boston is one of the nation's leading sports powerhouses in the world.

It was a challenge that he embraced.</p>\n<p>His offensive prowess is not to be overlooked as he led the Celtics to the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference just last season. Not one soul in Boston could forget the tragic night Thomas’ sister passed away in a fatal car crash.</p>\n<p>Just days after, Thomas played in Game 2 of the team’s Eastern Conference Semifinal matchup versus the Washington Wizards, on the day that would have been his sister’s 23rd birthday. Thomas went off for 53 points in what was a thriller of a 129-119 OT win for the Celtics.</p>\n<p>So, with all of his undeniable guts and glory, why would Boston feel the need to trade Thomas?</p>\n<p>The answer is simple: Boston business.</p>\n<p>This concept of doing what it takes to win is nothing new for Boston, as it is the most storied sports city in the nation.</p>\n<p>Irving is an offensive powerhouse with more length and the gift of time on his side. Younger, faster and NBA Finals experienced, it is clear that Irving is a much better player than Thomas.<br>\nIrving is a commanding player who could lead the Celtics and possibly give them the edge versus a Cleveland team who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the last season’s NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Fans say it’s wrong and broadcasters ask, “Where’s the loyalty?”</p>\n<p>But has it been forgotten that just a few years back, when New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe went down against the New York Jets in 2001, a young Tom Brady took the starting quarterback position out from under him because of his superior play? In 2013, the Boston Bruins traded away a young Tyler Seguin, who was said to be the future of the team, for reasons never disclosed but was undoubtedly a move to make the team better.</p>\n<p>Loyalty is not a plausible factor in the sports world, at least not when it comes to Boston.</p>\n<p>Boston will do what it takes to win because that is the culture of the winningest city in the nation.</p>\n<p>Boston knows nothing other than winning, and this is nothing new. It’s easy to question the aspect of loyalty when you are faced with the unknown.</p>\n<p>When Brady took over for Bledsoe in 2001, nobody knew that he would later be considered the greatest of all time.</p>\n<p>There were still some who wanted Bledsoe back in his starting role when he came back healthy. Instead, once Head Coach Bill Belichick committed to Brady as his starter, he did what some thought to be a vicious move — he traded Bledsoe and did so within his own AFC East division to the Buffalo Bills.</p>\n<p>This move wasn’t made out of malicious intent; rather, it was made to make the Patriots team even better as they acquired the Bills’ first round pick in 2003 in exchange for Bledsoe.</p>\n<p>It was obviously the right move to start Brady because the Patriots have since gone on to win the Super Bowl in 2002, 2004, 2005 and most recently in 2015 and 2017.</p>\n<p>The same can be said with the Celtics. Though the trade of Thomas looms over as a cloud of uncertainty, in addition to having to deal with the loss of Gordon Hayward for the season, the fact remains that Danny Ainge and the front office believe the Thomas-Irving move will make the team better.</p>\n<p>Boston is a city of champions, and no sense of loyalty to a player will keep that mentality alive, but keeping the business-savvy outlook of winning will. Being willing to do whatever it takes to keep the team successful, no matter how controversial, is one of the many qualities that separates Boston from the rest.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 26, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/boston-business-welcome-to-the-winners-circle/","id":1877,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[1876,1875,1874],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/47"}},"__N_SSG":true}
