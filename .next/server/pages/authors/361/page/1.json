In fact, he seemed like someone who could never in any way be shaken from the pocket, doing things like going a capella on his hardest verses while still making them sound like butter and challenging the crowd to keep up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world needs more rap shows like this — more rap shows that don’t stutter. That night, no one’s favorite lyrics were skipped, muffled, tripped over or mangled. The smoothness of Freddie Gibbs’s performance appeared to be unconscious, perhaps something to do with him having woken up just before taking the stage. After he came out singing “Now &amp; Later Gators,” quite possibly the closest thing to a soul song in any gangster rapper’s discography, he explained, “I’m higher than a motherfucker, I just woke up.” He added, to doubtlessly anticipated whoops and cheers, “I don’t know what the fuck I smoked, you know what I’m saying, some California shit.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is not to say, though, that his performance was sedated. If you’ve ever heard a Freddie Gibbs song, you are familiar with the liquid intensity that permeates his music, warped to whatever flow he is masterfully steering at any </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">moment you might pick out. His music is more engaging than it is hypnotic. It pulls you in, not down.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no tension to speak of between man and crowd; they had some sort of unspoken agreement that prevented any of that. It was mutually understood that everyone was simply there to wild out to, as Freddie Gibbs put it, “some gangsta shit.” And that is exactly what they did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It didn’t take long for Gibbs to get to cuts from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Piñata</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, his iconic 2014 collaboration with Madlib. After “Still Livin’” and “Eastside Moonwalker” warmed the room all the way up </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">along with playful interludes involving his trademark check-in, “Make some noise in this motherfucker,” and call-and-response go-tos “Say fuck po-lice, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fuck po-lice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” and “I say E-S, you say G-N: E-S, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G-N</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">…” – Freddie Gibbs did “Thuggin’.” And he didn’t just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it. He did it a capella — the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entire</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> thing. A full three minutes of three relentless, bare-knuckle verses with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> beat to back them up. And it </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">murdered</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The number of people rapping along throughout it was no small surprise. To say the least, Santa Barbara is not a hip hop city — many more UCSB students would rather listen to EDM on a knockoff Bose Mini speaker than pay more than five dollars for a rap concert ticket. But this crowd was different. I could only count one tank top-donning, bleach-blonde individual among them. The hip hop heads showed out for Freddie Gibbs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And he had them rocking. For the rest of the night, the building was all in. Other </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Piñata</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tracks “Harold’s” and “Deeper” surely elevated the crowd’s hype for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bandana</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the follow-up Madlib collaboration project set for release later this year. What followed was a filling setlist of banger after banger after banger, most of it coming off his 2018 commercial mixtape and latest non-single release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freddie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (as for his latest single releases, check out “Flat Tummy Tea” and “Bandana” if you haven’t already!)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world’s best charismatic, cold-blooded rapper seemed to be having fun. In between an earth-shaking “Triple Threat” and a raw and reckless “2 Legit,” he started singing lines from the latter’s Mary J. Blige sample and joked, “Fuck this rap shit, I’m tired of it. I’ma do R&amp;B.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He could pull it off, too. The man seems to make no wrong moves as of late. With more music already on the way,</span></p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_87853\" style=\"width: 769px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a

straightforward a project as its title suggests, but not in the way you would think. These aren’t the rap songs you’re used to hearing. They don’t flow the same way. They don’t announce themselves the same way. In the album’s introduction, the first thing you hear is James Baldwin saying,  “imprecise words.” While other rappers would like you to believe that they are masterful artists, that they have complete control over the English language and can say whatever they want to, however they want to, Earl Sweatshirt is upfront about not having found the right words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And he’s upfront about a lot more. Lead single “Nowhere2go” spotlights his depression and sugarcoats nothing. It’s a lot to take in. The beat ripples and surges; a wooden snare taps in between and over the top of waves of grumbling bass and stretched-out samples. The beat washes over and absorbs Earl, and he isn’t rapping so much as he’s delivering thoughts: “I think … I spent most of my life depressed / Only thing on my mind was death / Didn’t know if my time was next.” “Nowhere2go” has the formlessness you wouldn’t expect from a single. There’s no hook, no catchy refrain, no face-slapping ear-candy. Earl explains to Zane Lowe on Beats 1, “I’m not a single-ass n****, and it’s the closest thing that I got to a damn single.” There’s nothing to grab onto. Instead, the song grabs onto you. It’s the single that isn’t a single.

So, to say the least, Earl hasn’t always been happy with his parents. But he uses this opportunity to hear their side of it. His mother always loved him and wanted the best for him. His father concerned himself with the trauma of the world’s forgotten children and along the way forgot his own child. “To have a home is not a favor,” he reads. His anxious American child doesn’t want to harbor resentment. He wants to celebrate his parents. Earl wants to make peace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, Earl Sweatshirt’s third studio album is rainy-day rap music.

This power comes from a certain level of vulnerability that is mutually accepted throughout the development of a relationship. When we love one another or open ourselves up, exposing and addressing our flaws and concerns or intimate details of our lives, we are giving another person the opportunity to hurt us and simply trusting they won’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheating or infidelity is an act of betrayal that often breaks the trust that a healthy, growing relationship necessitates. While cheating may not mean our partner has lost all previously possessed feelings for us, I urge us to stray from the normalizing and acceptance of cheating not only because it is a behavior that is disrespectful and hurtful amongst other things, but more so because it is an act that can easily be avoided with a little respect and communication.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are fueled by love and desire throughout our relationships and in all relationships; it is important for each person to be open and honest not only with their partners but with themselves about these factors. Psychotherapist Esther Perel, known for her work with erotic intelligence, emphasizes the distinction between love and desire by explaining, “if there is a verb… that comes with love, it is ‘to have.’ And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is ‘to want.’ In love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved. We want to minimize the distance… We want closeness. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to the places we’ve already gone. Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest. In desire, we want an Other, somebody on the other side that we can go visit, that we can go spend some time with… In desire, we want a bridge to cross. Or in other words… fire needs air. Desire needs space.”’ </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To that point, there may be many factors that lead someone to cheat on or betray their partner. Often when someone has been cheated on their first reaction is to assume their partner no longer loves them or has the feelings they previously did for them. Many people ask themselves why they weren’t enough and begin to question every aspect of themselves depending on the level of intimacy and closeness of the relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While it is easier to fall into the pattern of these assumptions, these thoughts can often put us in a worse position than if we look at the situation objectively. Because a partner cheated does not necessarily mean they have lost all of the feelings that were previously held. However, this important acknowledgment does not justify infidelity.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cheater has acknowledged their partner will be hurt by their actions and makes a conscious decision to continue. It is that disrespect and lack of consideration of a partner’s feelings that make cheating unacceptable.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For what it’s worth, I have in fact been cheated on, and while the cheating didn’t initially end my six-year relationship, I felt the situation and the pain as a result of the situation could have been avoided had my boyfriend at the time addressed with me that he no longer wanted to be in a committed relationship. The words, at first, are hard to get out, but for someone who truly cares about their partner, no matter the level of intimacy, they must acknowledge how their partner would feel if they cheated on them instead of addressing the situation and know that not speaking up will result in a worse outcome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to say that addressing your desires will free your partner of all pain as a byproduct of the relationship. Chances are, if you are ending a relationship to pursue another, your partner will be hurt, but there are feelings of closure that come with a discussion that do not come with betrayal. Betrayal is a disregard of a partner’s feelings. A cheater has acknowledged their partner will be hurt by their actions and makes a conscious decision to continue. It is that disrespect and lack of consideration of a partner’s feelings that make cheating unacceptable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of this issue comes from the change in what conventional relationships are. What is considered “acceptable” today? Millennials are perpetually in limbo, grappling between what feels right and what has been established as right. In a relationship, it is okay to want what you want, but you must be able to acknowledge that a relationship takes two; you have to communicate and be clear while also taking into consideration what your partner wants as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more and more millennials are transitioning away from marriage, so-called “unconventional” relationships are becoming a norm. It is okay to have an open relationship. It is okay to be friends with benefits or casually date, but it is not okay to commit to someone and act differently before having a conversation. Not talking is not an excuse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think we should normalize cheating but normalize other types of relationships as long as the people involved are 100 percent aware of what the relationship is. We need to hold ourselves, our friends, our peers and our loved ones accountable. It is not that difficult to avoid cheating and the more we make excuses for one another the more likely it is for this behavior to continue.</span></p>\n<p><em>Aryana Kamelian implores individuals to consider the serious negative consequences that can result from infidelity.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cheating Isn’t So Bad</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83702\" style=\"width: 382px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83702\" data-attachment-id=\"83702\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/image_123986672-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?fit=372%2C277&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"372,277\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image_123986672-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?fit=372%2C277&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83702\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?resize=372%2C277\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"277\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?w=372&amp;ssl=1 372w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image_123986672-7.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Natalia Spritzer / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll start with a disclaimer: I have never cheated on someone nor do I hope to. I don’t think cheating on someone is something you should try to do, but I want to suggest with this article that cheating is not something that makes you a bad person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider polyamorous people (those in more-than-two-people relationships of various configurations) because they have an interesting view on the issue. Not to generalize, but within the polyamorous community, there is something known as “compersion.” Compersion is that good feeling you get when your partner has happy romantic feelings about someone else. The response to one’s partner saying “I slept with someone else today!” is “good for you!” Ridiculous, right?! Obviously, you should be unhappy about it, and you should make the person you supposedly love feel bad for having sex with someone else. S/he did betray you, after all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, doesn’t that sound familiar? Do scarlet letters, witch burnings and slut-shaming ring the same bells? They should. They are founded on the same unpleasant feelings. I ask that if you ever find yourself having those feelings, and you start to think of cheaters as a lower class of people, as less than moral, less than good, you’ll let your thoughts roll over those periods in history when adulterers were executed. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ask that you think about the more than several countries that to this day designate death as legal punishment for adultery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And maybe you’ll think about what some people like to do to others they find to be less than moral, less than good. I’m not being hyperbolic. I’m just saying that these sentiments, when mixed with power, do great evil—much greater evil than two people having consensual sex ever did—so they shouldn’t be fed or entertained. They shouldn’t be given credence.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to remember that people aren’t wired for monogamy, and it’s unreasonable to expect that once you decide on someone you’ll only be attracted to that one person for the rest of your life.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone cheats on you, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t love you. At the very least, it means they wanted to have sex, and someone else was there for them that wanted to have sex too. It could absolutely mean more, and I think that’s something that you, as a couple, should figure out. Talk. Be there for each other. And if you can’t do that, you should probably break up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But more often than not, cheating in a relationship is a symptom rather than the disease. There is something making that person look elsewhere. Whether that be for love, some type of connection or even an escape, the relationship should address it or risk becoming volatile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to remember that people aren’t wired for monogamy, and it’s unreasonable to expect that once you decide on someone you’ll only be attracted to that one person for the rest of your life. It doesn’t work like that. Love doesn’t work like that. Love isn’t a decision made in a single instant; it’s a continuous effort. Intimacy takes work. If you’re in a relationship, you should be open about those feelings and desires. Whether they be yours or your partner’s, pretending they don’t exist is a form of cruelty. Hearts can break in silence. Resentment can fester. Then, one day, the love you had seems to blow up. And it seems to be gone in a single instant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand that cheating hurts people. I understand that it leaves people feeling betrayed and disposable, that it makes people feel like garbage. And I think that’s terrible. It’s terrible that people come out of unfaithful relationships with years of trust issues and residual pain, and I think the blame for that rests on all of our shoulders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is all of our responsibility to talk about cheating without stigmatizing any group of people, cheat-ers or cheat-ees. We should recognize that jealousy comes from a selfish and possessive place, and we should remember that sex is (fairly) universal. Everyone may find themselves attracted to someone besides the one they’re already involved with, but that doesn’t mean that the love you already have is reduced in any way. We should have more realistic expectations of ourselves and the ones we love. No one’s self-worth should rely on the faithfulness of any one person because faithfulness does not equate to love. Love is a bridge built every day by openness and understanding.</span></p>\n<p><em>Konrad Neithercutt calls for an understanding approach to infidelity that humanizes cheaters and acknowledges the legitimate root of the issue.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-18/argument-in-the-office-the-ethics-of-infidelity/","id":5610,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[5609,5608,5607],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Quarter, New Music for Spring 2018","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/https-images.genius.com-2b4965ed2d77aecb2720be35d4e6f6ba.1000x1000x1.jpg?resize=300%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/https-images.genius.com-2b4965ed2d77aecb2720be35d4e6f6ba.1000x1000x1.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Punkers who don’t have fun, well, they’re just boring.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Flatbush Zombies, Vacation in Hell: April 6</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the beat drops on Vacation in Hell’s only single, “Headstone,” and Meechy Darko is growling a hook about putting “money over bitches on [his] headstone,” it’s clear that the Zombies are back from the dead again, and they brought their trademark grittiness with them.

In “Not in Love We’re Just High,” Nielson pretty much uses his voice as a synth, and he weaves it hypnotically through a bobbing core melody. “American Guilt,” however, is a fuzzy, driving expression of paranoia, flying on the back of a distorted hard rock riff. Here’s to hoping the rest of the songs deliver on the visceral tone that the album’s title implies and these songs promise.</span></p>\n<p><b>Thirty Seconds to Mars, America: April 6</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty Seconds to Mars decided to come back, and this time they’re not even pretending to be a rock band. Well, kinda. Singles “Walk on Water” and “Dangerous Night” sound like Imagine Dragons meets Ed Sheeran meets top-40 default sound boards meets Jared Leto’s singing voice. </span></p>\n<p><b>John Prine, The Tree of Forgiveness: April 13</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Country legend and restless human John Prine is set to release his 24th studio album. It’s been thirteen years since he’s released an album of all new material, and The Tree of Forgiveness’s singles show that time has been on Prine’s mind. In “Summer’s End,” time moves faster than anyone’s prepared for, and moments are lost before you’ve thought about them. And “Knockin’ on Your Screen Door” is a springy ode to old-man loneliness. And even though there’s a bit of summer breeze in their sound, Prine is sounding as timeless as he ever has on these singles, and this album looks as if it will maintain his reputation as a songwriter with a golden pen.</span></p>\n<p><b>A Perfect Circle, Eat the Elephant: April 20</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been 14 years since the heavy rock supergroup last unleashed an album’s worth of layered and animalistic darkness onto the world, and now it’s finally time for more. Two of the singles that are already out — “The Doomed” and “TalkTalk” — came with videos that take on an eerie and confrontational tone. “TalkTalk” is a spiritual criticism and a challenge to back up words with actions, and its music video features — lying in the hands of the most unnaturally pale of men — a palpitating heart/space-octopus. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>Janelle Monáe, Dirty Computer: April 27</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next manifestation of Janelle Monáe’s monstrous ambition comes attached with a film project to enrich the narrative. Monáe’s conceptual streak seems like it will hit a high mark this April. She released two crazy singles along with their music videos late last January. “Make Me Feel” is a groovy bit of dance pop that reinvents the sounds of Prince, and it reeks of just as much sex and glitter. (Monáe has stated that Prince actually worked on the project with her before his passing in 2016). “Django Jane,” on the other hand, is all filthy bars and disdain. Janelle Monáe is beyond crushing the competition at this point.</span></p>\n<p><b>Courtney Barnett, Tell Me How You Really Feel: May 18</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following up her collaborative album with Kurt Vile that came out last year, Courtney Barnett is set to release her second solo studio album this May. Lead single “Nameless, Faceless” sports more biting lyrics and louder guitars than is usual for Barnett. The chorus goes “I wanna walk through the park in the dark / Men are scared that women will laugh at them / I wanna walk through the park in the dark / Women are scared that men will kill them.” And with song titles like “I’m Not Your Mother, I’m Not Your Bitch” and “Crippling Self Doubt and a General Lack of Self Confidence,” who’s not curious about this album?</span></p>\n<p><b>Parquet Courts, Wide Awake!: May 18</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The singles from this album are more than punk with a groove; they’re punk that makes you want to move in platform shoes. That goes very well with lyrics like “All this music’s playin’ in my head / If it stops I’m / If it stops I’m / If it stops I’m having an unshakeable nightmare” from the latter half of “Almost Had to Start a Fight / In and Out of Patience.” Parquet Courts is having a lot of fun on this album, and that’s always a good sign. Punkers who don’t have fun, well, they’re just boring.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82226\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-04/new-music-for-spring-2018/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82226\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-04/new-music-for-spring-2018/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-04/new-music-for-spring-2018/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-04/new-music-for-spring-2018/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-04/new-music-for-spring-2018/","id":6657,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6656,6655,6654],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: Saturation III by Brockhampton","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-01-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brockhampton-saturation-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brockhampton-saturation-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Brockhampton just doesn’t stop.

The chipped vocals that appear frequently on the group’s material and are most apparent on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s “Fake” and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation II</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s “Jello” have almost died out. In fact, Kevin Abstract’s are the only vocals that undergo digital pitch manipulation on this album. The man is a hook machine. Since he’s all over the project supplying refrains and bridges as well as verses, it only serves to benefit the diversity of Brockhampton’s sound. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

And there are at least five beats in it! And no, “Sister/Nation” is not even close to sounding like an unlistenable jumble. It’s actually the best song on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation III</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and arguably the best song the group’s put out as of yet. In it, they maneuver a toggling transition from untethered insanity to understated meditation so expertly as to tell a story of internal conflict, external pressure and defiant ambition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this song alone, production borrows from industrial, psychedelic, electro and pop music. The whole album sports an eclectic set of influences. “Hottie” is about as close to mid- to late-2000s indie pop a hip-hop group can sound without literally being MGMT. They translate that synthy, dancy music to modern hip-hop, and the result is a soft-hearted tune inseparable from the angst of the restless discomfort of childhood. It’s a song where Merlyn Wood can rap “Man, I wish I had a rocket/Wish I ain’t feel microscopic/Wish my thoughts was telepathic” and you can feel yourself melt a little.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soul and flow of R&amp;B infects the tracks “Bleach” and “Rental.” You can even catch Matt Champion </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">singing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on “Rental.” This is the same Matt Champion whose low-key persona and laid-back delivery is probably the most fitting for Brockhampton’s predominantly West Coast rap sound, and he’s actually a good singer. His pre-chorus and bridge provide a sexy and sleek quality that makes “Rental” what it is: a glossy and smooth piece of pop rap. It makes me wish he would sing more. And maybe he will — Brockhampton has already announced the 2018 release of their next album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Team Effort</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is ridiculous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brockhampton just doesn’t stop. Their first three albums sound like no one else’s, and all of them are among the best rap albums of 2017, so Brockhampton may not remain on the periphery of mainstream rap for much longer. Their every facet is in-house: production, record label, merchandise, advertising, touring management, etc. In 2017, they made and released thirteen music videos and a short film. Brockhampton may very well be the leading figures in the next era of hip-hop. Rappers and entrepreneurs who grew up on Kanye West and Lil Wayne were raised by the Internet when they were forgotten by everyone else around them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brockhampton met on an online forum for Kanye West fans, and they all moved from Texas to a house in L.A. together to foster an environment of unbridled creative energy. They’re a grassroots boy band. And to say they are the boy band heirs to the throne last held by One Direction (which they say a lot) is to say they are the end of one era and the beginning of another. Whatever that era is, it’s about the Internet. It’s a discussion as diverse as its members and as free as their imagination.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80342\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-06/the-friday-review-saturation-iii-by-brockhampton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80342\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-06/the-friday-review-saturation-iii-by-brockhampton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-06/the-friday-review-saturation-iii-by-brockhampton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-06/the-friday-review-saturation-iii-by-brockhampton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-06/the-friday-review-saturation-iii-by-brockhampton/","id":6868,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6867,6866,6865],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: The OOZ by King Krule","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KINGKRULE_THEOOZ_COVER_310717.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KINGKRULE_THEOOZ_COVER_310717.jpg?resize=400%2C400&ssl=1","description":"As some of the best things in life, Marshall’s voice is somewhat of an acquired taste.

This is the 23-year-old’s second album under the King Krule moniker, the first being <em>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</em>, which made waves in 2013 with its eclectic and precociously distinct sound and gained the attention and adoration of such famed artists as Beyoncé and Frank Ocean. But it seems Marshall wants to do some exploring while he’s still young; find himself; rebel a little. What sprung from his unsettled soul was an exercise in bipolar lunacy.</p>\n<p>Throughout the new project, the singer/songwriter/musician/producer whirls from lo-fi to hi-fi, across a spectrum of tempos and from sedated to agitated states in a manner that would be dizzying if it weren’t so seamless. There’s a balance to Marshall’s madness. He expands on the smooth moodiness of <em>6 Feet</em>, but his punk influences enjoy much more air time here. His vocal adaptations to these rougher, more addled sounds are even more compelling.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As some of the best things in life, Marshall’s voice is somewhat of an acquired taste. Its abundant richness can be overwhelming to the unaccustomed listener, but the low register and thick South London accent in which he sings provide a rawness much needed in an age when overproduction often sucks the life out of the human voice. King Krule’s music, on the other hand, comes from underneath you, and on this album takes you underwater. This is violently true on the album’s punkier cuts. The restless, distorted guitar riffs on songs like “Dum Surfer” and “Emergency Blimp” do well to complement Marshall’s deep and untethering vocals as they come to an aggravated boil. An echoing, bass-heavy symphony of waves crashes overhead. These songs have you bobbing your whole body and rattling inside it.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say Marshall can’t deliver a fantastic slow jam. On the wistfully declarative title track and the down-tempo, syncopated grooves of “Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver),” he fishes a jazzy melancholy from the depths of his soul. Tracks like these are the most personal on the album — and beautifully so. Between the latter’s soft weep of guitar chords comes the sobering and pensive reflection, “Why’d you leave me because of my depression? / You used to complete me, but I guess I learned a lesson.” Marshall exhibits a talent for loading and springing coils of emotion in the span of a couple lyrics. On countless occasions, he offers the uncanny prose of the troubled, disaffected mind. The barking refrain of “Slush Puppy,” “Nothin’ is workin’ with me,” bears the artist’s mounting frustration as it floats into the ether, dissipates and surrounds you. To resist absorbing it is thoroughly difficult. Marshall’s thoughts entice you into embracing them as your own, no matter how malignant they announce themselves to be. They wash over you, but they also wash beneath you, through you and within you.</p>\n<p><em>The OOZ</em> is a different atmosphere. Marshall plays the navigator of its deep, dark depths. In this collage of genres and influences, boundaries dissolve. King Krule creates a musical space totally new and unknown, where the recesses of the subconscious manifest as part of the landscape. <em>The OOZ</em> inhabits those late-night hours when the demons of the mind and city slink about. The freedom is theirs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2HRzIyyXvU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tia Rotolo: British singer Archy Marshall — better known as King Krule — returns to music, but not humanity, with the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OOZ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Friday, Oct. 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its induction up until its final note, Marshall’s latest LP is in motion as a distorted expenditure through time and space, abandoning glorifications of permanence. With brutally honest imagery, King Krule wrestles with human emotions, despite making every effort to resent humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album begins slowly with “Biscuit Town.” Airy guitar riffs and static resemble a train moving over tracks. It’s familiar, but there’s something off about it. The track opens, “I seem to sink lower.” His deep, looming vocals immediately capture the listener in a firm grip juxtaposed with the delicate notes of the guitar. The song drops to a beat with every final note in the line lingering for slightly too long, evoking a discomfort that intrigues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there’s one thing King Krule has mastered, it’s creating something so eerie, so vile yet so addictive. His sound represents a sketchy alleyway at midnight: Even though we know better, we want to see what lies beyond. Howling chilling sounds, he challenges his audience to stay with him against all notions of common sense.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He presents his listener with one question: Where do we go when we don’t fit in anywhere? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His answer lies in a vast unknown, deep oceans and outer space. Both are odes to his previous albums and can be haunting to the average person, but he finds solace in them nonetheless. He’s lost and alone. His only places of belonging are where no one does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A town alarm warns listeners of the commencement of the song, “Sublunary.” In an auto-tuned alien-like voice, King Krule talks of being “made for sublunary,” a reference to an earlier King Krule record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 Feet Beneath the Moon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here, there are no physics, no humanity, and no emotions; This is where he belongs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sad as the album’s premise is, it doesn’t ask for sympathy. For each melodramatic line, Marshall presents a grotesque image of vomit or mutation, as done in “Lonely Blue.” He is not romantic; he is disgusting and vulgar, but also potent and unapologetic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like a lullaby, “Czech One” emulates a dream state. The song masters the feeling of wanting to fall asleep but being wide awake. Struggling with insomnia, the artist wrestles with the thought of the woman he can’t forget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She still sits in my dreams,” he sings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He can’t escape her. Driven to insanity, Marshall and his listeners are invited to mourn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly every line is short and abrupt. This element of disjointment imitates a stream of consciousness, jumping from one thought to the next. What stitches each line together are the instrumentals, mediating the words to comprehension while sustaining the chaos of Marshall’s psyche.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Bermondsey Bosom (Right),” his father talks to the listener delicately over oriental sounds. He references Marshall’s previous albums, speaking as someone who knows him, but may not fully understand him. He’s unable to accept people and finds difficulty in distinguishing “paradise” and “parasites.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Half Man Half Shark,” the singer’s lack of humanity transitions into animalia. He distinguishes himself from others as empty and losing meaning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See world, you’ll never know/At least when you look to the stars they still glow/Well, not for me though</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” he sings, confirming that he’s the only one who can truly understand his own state of mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subtly drifting to a new dimension, the artist takes his listener to “The Cadet Leaps.”  With piano and static, he creates his own atmosphere. He’s lost but surrounded, gazing on humanity from a higher standpoint, watching the parasites and paradise get twisted in their own misconceptions. The listener discovers that the mysterious woman understood his condition and could transcend above humanity with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The title track begins with a woman speaking, “Its motion, it’s urgent, its trigger.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">King Krule in the background asks, “Is there anybody out there?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song is oozing with something unrefined. Pleas from Marshall include, “Could we align?” He’s desperate for human connection, but with someone who can understand. Melancholy and intricate, he is giving into companionship, slowly drifting back to a human place. “It’s cold by the fire,” he repeats again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album evens out with its closing track, “La Lune,” which uses elements of bass and guitar most resembling his earlier works. In addition to rain drizzling in the background and lighters being lit, he analyzes the human process of becoming the people we fall in love with, saying, “It won’t be long … / Till you’re inside my heart.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this song, as with much of the album, Marshall takes his listener to a familiar place of consciousness, but it’s a place that most people don’t wish to return to if they don’t have to. This is a place of darkness, where light isn’t known by its presence but solely by one’s belief in it. As a physical place, this state of mind can be related to the ocean and space, tying the themes of the album together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of leaving the disturbing mental state, King Krule soaks in its discomfort. In creating his home here, he can no longer be a human being, but instead becomes some adjunct of the universe. Yet, he still wrestles with human needs, as he wishes to be “Elevated with you.” The guitar riffs and static even out and eventually the listener is left alone in silence as the album ends simply and modestly. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OOZ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is depressive, sometimes manic, but always unforgiving. King Krule does not wish to evoke sympathy or some romanticized images of the depression which ails him. He’s basking in the originality and repugnance of his suffering. He’s full of guilt and regret, but he’s recognized the value of these emotions. Attempting to find his position in time and space, he wrestles with what we know and what we’ve yet to truly understand about the human condition. There are no false idealizations of a physical home, but merely a presentation of a mental state worth diving into.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79201\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79201\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/","id":6679,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6678,6677,6676],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: Cry Cry Cry by Wolf Parade","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wolfparade-crycrycry-3000.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wolfparade-crycrycry-3000.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Wolf Parade isn’t afraid to take risks on their comeback album.

And in the indie rock luminaries’ first full-length album in seven years, vocalists Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner are belting their hearts out onto the table in true Wolf Parade fashion. <em>Cry Cry Cry</em> has all the energy of a sugar-filled toddler tucked into bed with a blanket of dejection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In “Valley Boy,” the album’s first single, the band provides a valley filled to the brim with sonic sweets. It deepens and spills over, the drums, guitars and vocals trading center stage and playing off of each other like actors in a meticulous drama. The subject of the drama appears to be a David Bowie-esque figure, a beloved singer lost to the realm of the dead whose last phase in life holds some mystery. (And who’s to say it’s not Bowie himself? The icon is a noted influence of the band, after all.) The lyrics are accusatory; they sound as if they are spoken by a distraught fan or old friend of the famous songster. Krug asks the deceased singer questions he can’t answer: “Are you still a lover boy? / Are you still on the cover or / Did you become a valley boy out there?” He obsesses over how this singer could have possibly lost his lovely and sincere disposition, and he dreads this betrayal. This hostility is a thin veil for grief. Emotions contend and pull Krug in every direction, but his confusion sounds so good.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRslooNX4Js?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Similarly equivocal is <em>Cry Cry Cry</em>’s second single, “You’re Dreaming.” Boeckner grabs the mic to bemoan the daydream of the information age in a blissfully sardonic number. Although the dream is a bad one taking place in a fantasy world inseparable from violence and destruction, there’s so much excitement in its sound. The song introduces itself with the cheeky staccato of a keyboard. Guitars electrically weave in and out of the melody, helping to drive the beat forward in the verses and constructing flaring bridges between them. Lyrics and sonics ascend into the deceptively jubilant howl of an individual trapped in a bad dream.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wolf Parade isn’t afraid to take risks on their comeback album. The linear “Incantation” is them at their most assertive and unafraid. The band unleashes a horn section after the song’s first dive into cacophony, a tornado of twinkling keys and buzzing guitars. The guitars win out with bursting notes but quickly pull back to let the piano begin a forceful trot that just as quickly reconvenes with its instrumental co-conspirators, who by the end of it are wailing and stomping their feet. Where “Incantation” is a deliberate march into chaos, “Flies on the Sun” is a woozy march through the oppressive sands of time. By its fourth and final minute, you’re teetering on the brink of collapse. By the end, you’re one of many “flies on the sun, lying there.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All of these songs, however, are bite-sized treats compared to the king-sized “Baby Blue” and “Weaponized.” These six-minute tracks make up the core of the album, and they are a one-two that reckons with the best of them. The great control and eccentricity Wolf Parade displays in these power ballads is the band at its most impressive. “Baby Blue” is an epic display of the band’s capability. It sounds like a battle royale taking place in a locomotive that’s careening around corners and through mountains. “Weaponized” is a bit more measured. A skillful combination of anxious energy and bleeding soul backs Boeckner’s singing about a battle with yourself that feels like a battle against the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Modern-day isolation is certainly a recurring theme, but Wolf Parade is not saying they have any solutions for it. While Krug tangles himself in the pain of isolation on “Am I an Alien Here,” Boeckner begs for it on “Artificial Life.” He pleads for some peace and quiet in a soundscape like the world of a broken arcade game that he’s been sucked into. What the band finally arrives at, though, is a question. The closing track, “King of Piss and Paper,” is a meditation on the political and social state of the world. Wolf Parade asks if it’s okay to sing about love and ourselves at this time in a geopolitical environment led by a fear and hate-mongering papier-mâché man. This “king” threatens people’s ways of life and, in a way, love itself. So is it wrong to ignore him to attend to ourselves and each other, even if for a second? Isn’t it wrong that it feels that way?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This fear, this hatred, these illusions and their concomitant feelings of overstimulation and alienation stand front and center in the album. What Wolf Parade did with <em>Cry Cry Cry</em> was give voice to those emotions of the modern age that swirl in the chaos. They gave us a thoughtfully grand exhibition of the sickness of the times.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79199\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79199\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/the-friday-review-cry-cry-cry-by-wolf-parade/","id":6676,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6675,6674,6673],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/361"}},"__N_SSG":true}
