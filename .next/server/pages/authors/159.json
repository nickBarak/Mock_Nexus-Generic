Students also criticized Napolitano’s proposed state budget revisal to freeze tuition until the 2017–2018 school year. At the conclusion of the event, attendees wrote individual petitions to Governor Jerry Brown and the UC Board of Regents voicing their frustration on tuition increases.</p>\n<p>EVPSA Office Fellow and first-year Asian American studies and political science double major Akshaya Natarajan said the event aimed to “rally voices” and communicate that the suggested tuition freezes are not a sufficient solution to the increasing cost of tuition.</p>\n<p>​”The message for this event says that we are still fucked because there are a lot of problems, such as the eight percent increase of out of state tuition and increases for graduate school tuition as well,” Natarajan said. “Tuition freeze is not enough because it will fuck us over in the future if it is not taken care of.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and art double major Joseline Garcia said We’re fUCked informs students of how tuition hikes affect them.</p>\n<p>“This will get students angry because you need an education no matter where you go,” Garcia said. “Your skin color, background, lifestyle, culture, ideals and majors do not matter because this tuition hike will definitely affect you in some way.”</p>\n<p>​Natarajan said tuition hikes should receive more “pressing exposure” from the media.</p>\n<p>“This is why we invited plenty of news sources to report on this specific event today,” Natarajan said. “As long as we have more momentum and more media, then I deeply believe this will influence more change for the betterment of all students. It is not enough to simply oppose the tuition hikes.”</p>\n<p>​Natarajan said students should be angered by the tuition hikes and continue protesting in order to affect change.</p>\n<p>“Defunding of the UC is something that anyone should be angered about because, realistically, we are paying more and more for our public education, even though the state should be funding us,” Natarajan said. “We have angered students all across the state.”</p>\n<p>​Tuition increases contribute to financial challenges for students now and will continue to do so in their futures, according to EVPSA and fourth-year political science and film &amp; media studies double major Melvin Singh.</p>\n<p>“I am starting to believe that school is only preparing me to deal with a bad economy which is full of debts such as the tuition hikes which are fucking us all,” Singh said. “This is why we are still fucked and angry.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza said temporary tuition freezes are comparable to open wounds.</p>\n<p>“If you take a knife and stick it six inches deep into a man’s body and pull it out, it is not progress,” Mirza said. “Progress is healing that wound completely. The same thing is happening now because the UC system is pulling the knife out instead of healing the students’ wounds.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said Brown and Napolitano do not consider students’ perspectives when raising tuition.</p>\n<p>“I think Governor Brown and President Napolitano think it is a good idea to raise tuition because they are not students,” Mirza said. “This is not their university. This is our university.”</p>\n<p>A.S. off-campus senator and second-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said unaffordable tuition restricts her housing situation.</p>\n<p>“I live in a one bedroom apartment in Isla Vista,” Dela Cruz said. “I have five roommates who live with me, not because they want to, but because the tuition costs leave them with no other viable option.”</p>\n<p>Community affairs student engagement and advocacy advisor and graduate student Aaron Jones said the UC system is “undermining” the students’ efforts.</p>\n<p>“I am utterly displeased with conversations about the tuition hikes,” Jones said. “I am utterly displeased because there are thousands of students who are trying their damn best to be the best students they can be.”</p>\n<p>Jones said while graduate students work long hours, they still face student debt following graduating.</p>\n<p>“As graduate students and TA’s, we put in hours of hard work by grading hundreds of papers and studying for our own classes,” Jones said. “In turn, we receive debt as a reward which only causes sorrow and leads people to have less confidence in the education system.”</p>\n<p>According to Garcia, tuition hikes have a greater impact on students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“I think it is ridiculous to raise tuition because this will only cause people to be less educated in society,” Garcia said. “It puts people of color at risk of not receiving an education and makes society unreliable as a whole. We need more educated people to make life more efficient.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

murder</h3>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) held a memorial tree planting Wednesday to honor the six victims of the events of May 23 last year at the school’s West Campus.</p>\n<p>Students and administrators planted sunflowers and six trees to honor each of the six students who passed away last spring. SBCC President Lori Gaskin and two members of SBCC’s Associated Student Government spoke to dedicate the memorial grove. A plaque with the names of the six students sits in the middle of the grove.<br>\nGaskin said the memorial trees represent ongoing remembrance of the six students.</p>\n<p>“It is to honor and remember the victims through tree planting in order to have a permanent symbol of what happened last year,” Gaskin said. “It is for future generations to see so that it can live on in perpetuity and remembrance of those six victims.”</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, the event is an opportunity to unite Santa Barbara communities.<br>\n“Right now, it is time to work together with UCSB, Isla Vista and the Santa Barbara community, which is more of an opportunity for us to strengthen ties,” Gaskin said.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said college is a time of “joy, celebration and discovery,” and the victims should not have lost that time.</p>\n<p>“For those opportunities to be shattered is devastating, as it happened to the six young lives,” Gaskin said. “It causes reflection and calls to action for things to change.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Student Government President and second-year undeclared major Colette Brown said the trees create a space to appreciate natural beauty and remember the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think it is necessary for us to use this space not only for something beautiful, but for those individuals who were killed last year in Isla Vista,” Brown said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63155\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63155\" data-attachment-id=\"63155\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/tree-memorial_lorenzo-basilio-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430925421\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"60\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tree Memorial_Lorenzo Basilio-10\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63155\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63155\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>SBCC Associated Student Government Vice President of External Affairs and second-year business and administration major Caleb Ransom said the memorial grove will foster unity in support of those who were close to the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think this is crucial for the families and friends of those who have passed away,” Ransom said. “We all mourn and I think this is ultimately important for the community and the colleges because it brings everyone together. It goes to show that we are human and here for a purpose.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Laura Guzman said the dedication event was “positive,” because it brought people together to heal.</p>\n<p>“Victims died, however, people still express their concerns and support by remembering and honoring the victims,” Guzman said. “There is still light at the end of the tunnel and I think it is getting brighter because this beautification will remind us of the strength in unity.”</p>\n<p>Guzman said the strong demonstration of community support is an effective step towards healing the wounds left by last year’s tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Even though people are feeling pretty sad right now because we remember the tragedy, I am still thankful for being a part of this,” Guzman said. “I think it is important to remain thankful and give gratitude for the people who care to make a difference in sorrowful times.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>A v</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63196\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63196\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/","id":4704,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[4703,4702,4701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Recycling is a readily available campus resource that students should be using consistently.</p>\n<p>“Associated Students Recycling aspires to help young people to change the environment like recycling plastic bottles,” Herrera said. “We have a lot of yearly support from the community and we are growing more and more.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62798\" style=\"width: 326px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62798\" data-attachment-id=\"62798\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/i-v-earth-day-highlights-environmental-issues/iv-earth-day-festival-anisqoyo-park-april-25th-2015-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,429\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D600&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1429981542&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IV Earth Day Festival\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62798 \" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3-250x179.jpg?resize=316%2C226\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"316\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62798\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Herrera said events such as I.V.

Earth Day to support local environmentalism. Brimer also said people should view the environment the same way they see their homes and not allow littler to accumulate.</p>\n<p>“If your house is filled with trash, you would not enjoy it,” Brimer said. “The earth is my home so it does make me uncomfortable to see things like littering.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Andrea Renteria said she tabled with her sociology class, Topics in Sexuality, to inform Earth Day attendees that overpopulation is threatening the environment.</p>\n<p>“We are tabling because, if we can control the increase in size of the population, we can lessen problems that directly affect our environment,” Renteria said. “It is through actions where we will see change.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year mathematics major Jose Lombera said students should lead by example to initiate change in the environment.</p>\n<p>“If we recycle more and keep our community clean, more people will follow this positive model which is good to our earth,” Lombera said. “Future generations can better the environment, but it is up to us to make it as great as we can.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_62799\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62799\" data-attachment-id=\"62799\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/i-v-earth-day-highlights-environmental-issues/iv-earth-day-festival-anisqoyo-park-april-25th-2015-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,429\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D600&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1429985213&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.001&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IV Earth Day Festival\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62799\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?resize=600%2C429\" alt=\"80's Alumni band The Tearwayas performed during the Earth Day festival.

CAB’s visit was prompted by the wake of violent protests sparked by the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August of last year.  </p>\n<p>Third-year political science and philosophy double major major and Alternative Breaks co-coordinator coordinator Jeremiah Copeland said the event was entirely different from other CAB events he has attended due to its social justice focus and level of personal engagement with local community members. </p>\n<p>“I thought that the trip was very powerful and a great experience,” Copeland said. “The social justice aspect of the trip was something completely different than CAB has ever really done before, so it was a refreshing experience.” </p>\n<p>Copeland said he has been on other alternative spring breaks, but this trip was more focused on social justice work and remolding systems of power for positive change. </p>\n<p>“I have been on an alternative break to Colorado for flood relief and Oakland to work with foster youth and at food banks,” Copeland said. “Those were more volunteer oriented, and this Ferguson trip was more learning about the multitude of issues that are affecting the area and what we can do to help.” </p>\n<p>Copeland also said the alleged presence of racism in law enforcement in the nation is an issue that must be dealt with on a local and federal level. </p>\n<p>“I think that the Michael Brown case has brought to bright light the racism that is present in many police departments across the nation. It must be stopped,” Copeland said. </p>\n<p>CAB member and first-year Xuewen Sherry Li said the said the situation in Ferguson was upsetting but sparked a vital impetus change in the nation.  </p>\n<p>“It’s sad that this many lives had to end before the silence was broken, but I think awareness and solidarity has brought people from all across the country together,” Li said. </p>\n<p>According to Li, the trip was an impactful experience for her and for all Gaucho participants. </p>\n<p>“It was absolutely amazing, this trip has made me realize that I don’t have to get on a plane to make an impact,” Li said. “All around me are breaches that can be fixed and voices to fight for.”<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62096\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62096\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/","id":2842,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2841,2840,2839],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Clean Up I.V.

Trash-collectors concluded the clean-up by watching the sun set along the I.V. coastline.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year environmental studies major and outreach and education coordinator for the Coastal Fund Kylie Taylor said it is important to clean I.V. beaches regularly because of the university research conducted in these areas.</p>\n<p>“We like to clean the beach as much as we can – at least once a quarter at minimum,” Taylor said. “Our organization is so focused on funding research projects in the coastline. It is important to our statement and values to keep it clean as we help people do their research in the coastal regions of Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Taylor also said alcohol-related activities increase local waste in the ocean – specifically by allowing broken glass, bottles and cans to collect on the beach.</p>\n<p>“Some of it can be blamed on alcohol,” Taylor said. “You can see broken glass in the streets of Isla Vista that gets transferred onto the beach. Some students also toss bottles and cans into the sand area after playing Frisbee. We want to get rid of these wastes as much as we can because we know that alcohol can be a factor in making the beaches dirtier.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Alex Germann attended the beach clean-up and said it made him feel like he was “making a difference … especially after a Friday night.”</p>\n<p>“After cleaning the ocean, I definitely feel good about myself – as an individual and that I helped out the community,” Germann said.</p>\n<p>According to Germann, conducting a quarterly beach clean-up not only benefits the environment, but also has positive implications for safety.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the mess, I feel like it is not done on purpose, but sometimes it tends to happen,” Germann said. “If we volunteer to help and clean up, it is actually better for everybody.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year environmental studies major and Coastal Fund outreach and education coordinator Kevin Lou said the beach was not a big part of his life prior to attending the university, but that, after moving to the area, he has learned that the ocean has a lot to offer to the community.</p>\n<p>“Before coming out to UCSB, I [lived] too far from the coast so it was not a big part of my life,” Lou said. “But, after moving here it is definitely a big part of every person’s life here from the environment to activities in the spring like going to the beach and watching the sunsets.”</p>\n<p>According to Lou, this beach clean-up differs from previous endeavors in that it took place in the late afternoon instead of the conventional early morning start, allowing volunteers to watch the sunset after clean-up.</p>\n<p>“We, as a group, thought it would be interesting to host this event in the afternoon to see the sunset at the end of the clean-up,” Lou said. “Instead of having it in the morning, we assumed that students do not want to wake up early in the morning in hopes of having a bigger turnout.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Mark Butello said he moved to Isla Vista in 1982 and has been participating in beach clean-ups ever since.</p>\n<p>“I used to walk up and down the beaches with a friend back in 1982 when I got here from Los Angeles,” Butello said. “We would gather up trash and clean it thoroughly. I still clean the beaches when I have the spare time to come to events like this. I love my community and do not want to leave Isla Vista.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/students-clean-up-i-v-beaches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/students-clean-up-i-v-beaches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/students-clean-up-i-v-beaches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/students-clean-up-i-v-beaches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/students-clean-up-i-v-beaches/","id":4746,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[4745,4744,4743],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Humyn Rights Board, Students for Justice in Palestine Host Talk","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Associated Students Humyn Rights Board held a talk titled “Occupation, Ethnic Cleansing, & Israeli Apartheid 101” on Thursday in the Conference Room of El Centro as part of Humyn Rights Week 2015.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61432\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61432\" data-attachment-id=\"61432\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/occupation_sam-aragon-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the interesection of palestine and other human rights issues.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424979432\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"90\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Occupation_Sam Aragon-2\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the interesection of palestine and other human rights issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61432\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?resize=600%2C398\" alt=\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the intersection of Palestine and other human rights issues.

SJP President and second-year sociology major Anumita Kaur was the main speaker for the presentation and began the event speaking about the many ways in which Palestine is affected by the occupation and apartheid of the region, as well as the U.S.’s relationship with the conflict.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, the problems in Palestine span a wide range of humanitarian issues that transcend the political motives controlling the region.</p>\n<p>“In regards to Palestine, it connects to women’s issues, queer issues, environmental problems, state violence, immigration and displacement of indigenous populations,” Kaur said. “It goes beyond transnational borders because it is much more than people perceive. It does not just affect one group of people with one issue.”</p>\n<p>Kaur said the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting case of Michael Brown in the U.S. is directly tied to Palestinian oppression because the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) trained some members of the American police force who were active in Ferguson.</p>\n<p>“The government in Palestine is super fearful of public opinion and resistance. But the IDF trains the police in the U.S. to have the same fear,” Kaur said. “It is connected to the Ferguson issue because the police here are trained to oppress resistance at all violent costs. It was a case of rampant anti-blackness.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, police brutality leading to the death of innocent people is modeled after “the hatred and strategy of the Israeli army.” Kaur said the strategy stems from the fear of possible opposition, aiming to abuse people from the lower class and encouraging the marginalization of these people in a consistent manner.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental science major Nia Mitchell said her historically marginalized Afro-Cuban culture helps her understand the ongoing oppression in Israel.</p>\n<p>“I identify as Afro-Cuban and I realize that my people are and have been dominated and oppressed,” Mitchell said. “This is what happens in all lands. Therefore, it is so clear for me to see how it is impossible to take away issues like women oppression because of interconnectivity between dominance and exploitation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61431\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61431\" data-attachment-id=\"61431\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/occupation_sam-aragon/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the interesection of palestine and other human rights issues.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424978633\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Occupation_Sam Aragon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61431\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-1024x678.jpg?resize=365%2C242\" alt=\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the intersection of Palestine and other human rights issues.

Women have very little rights there and this will unfortunately most likely continue.”</p>\n<p>Sociology graduate student Jeremy Garza said racism exists in different forms in the U.S. and Palestine.</p>\n<p>“All forms of racism are not the same around the world. For example, we see in the Ferguson case that there is discrimination against blacks,” Garza said. “There are also a lot of African immigrants in Israel and they are not given documentation, rights, work, and are only provided with segregation.”</p>\n<p>According to Garza, African women are being sterilized in Israel because the government wants to control the population.</p>\n<p>“These women are not provided with equal rights but are being sterilized which is an example of how the government controls their people,” Garza said. “This is a tactic that the U.S. has used plenty of times in South America and with Native Americans.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major Shahryar Mooraj said female immigrants in Gaza must also face sterility checkpoints and are unable to obtain medical assistance such as medicine, ambulances and local doctors.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of unfairness in Palestine, especially with the issue of sterilizing women at checkpoints. Women are being sterilized but do not get to experience medical attention and it is definitely unfair for Palestinians,” Mooraj said. “They do not have access to medical aid in Gaza which is a denial of life. There are no ambulances or speedy recoveries.”</p>\n<p>Mooraj said his immigrant lifestyle in the U.S. is much easier than the life of Palestinian immigrant because he is granted basic civil rights and allowed to travel.</p>\n<p>“I am an international student myself and cannot imagine the troubles that immigrants face in Palestine,” Mooraj said. “The restriction of movement of the Palestinian people is wrong because they have been there for years and are denied public services. I fortunately have not faced such discrimination in the U.S. so far as an immigrant student.”</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, people should be allowed to relocate and travel in their search for suitable living conditions.</p>\n<p>“At the core, this is really a human rights violation because people need to have the right to move around and find comfort,” Mooraj said. “They need to be able to grow and expand. People in Gaza and the West Bank just do not have that and I find it to be completely awful.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61440\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61440\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/","id":2861,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2860,2859,2858],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"American Indian Author, Poet Reads from Newest Book","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"American Indian author, poet and professor at Washington and Lee University Deborah A.

It was all about how a family was all massacred where the husband survives and has more children,” Miranda said. “This is rather amusing now, but we need to keep in mind that this is all coming from childhood trauma that deals with familial matters.”</p>\n<p>According to Miranda, humor is important to her teaching style because she believes that “Washington is paying her to make other people’s lives miserable,” and it allows her students to be successful in the future.</p>\n<p>“Humor is important from the start. I bring guest professionals in my class that students will not expect, and I feel like I must make people feel intimidated and bring different perspectives by making other people miserable,” Miranda said. “Washington pays me to make people feel miserable. Sometimes it works as it makes my students successful.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61312\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/american-indian-author-poet-reads-from-newest-book/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61312\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/american-indian-author-poet-reads-from-newest-book/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/american-indian-author-poet-reads-from-newest-book/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/american-indian-author-poet-reads-from-newest-book/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/american-indian-author-poet-reads-from-newest-book/","id":2882,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2881,2880,2879],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Community Meets for Year’s Second Town Hall, Brainstorms I.V.

I.V. is represented directly by the county board of supervisors and currently has no form of local governance save the I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), which only controls I.V.’s numerous parks.</p>\n<p>The town hall was hosted by Assemblyman and AB 3 author Das Williams and divided attendees into small groups to discuss possibilities such as a utility tax, a parking tax, a transient occupy tax, a marijuana-dispensary tax, a Goleta sales tax and a party registration tax to fund the potential CSD. Taxation will fund I.V. public services including improved lighting and a parking program, among others.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61226\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61226\" data-attachment-id=\"61226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/das-williams-discussing-the-bill-with-a-community-member/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424480668\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"97\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61226\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Assemblyman Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.

Attendees also favored the possible implementation of a parking program to generate additional revenues, as well as the establishment of a rental-tenant mediation board to sort out issues between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>Utilities taxable under most models presented at the meeting include water, internet, cable, gas and trash with special exemptions to low-income families under certain models.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill language includes powers for a CSD to contract for additional public safety services such as community service officers; a rental housing mediation task force; a municipal advisory council, which would allow the CSD to advise the county on additional policy for I.V.; and an area planning commission similar to one existing in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee (SBCC) and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the three most likely types of tax for I.V. students and residents are a utilities tax; a creative sales deliveries tax, which refers to marijuana dispensary delivery taxes; and parcel taxes, which tax properties and are primarily used to fund public education.</p>\n<p>“I think what was presented here were great,” Abboud said. “The ideas were helpful and I think the utilities tax will be the number one idea and we should definitely have that one. The creative sales deliveries tax will be good as well, which involves marijuana. A small parcel tax will also work.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the marijuana tax could be beneficial for I.V. residents because many users and non-users alike favor taxing marijuana for city revenue.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, a marijuana tax came up a lot and the utilities tax is the most popular,” Williams said. “Marijuana advocates believe that it should be taxed and it seems like they mean it; this would also help students out. It can also be paid for.”</p>\n<p>Coffee Collaborative owner Steve McDonough said he does not support the utilities tax, which charges utility users for consumption of electricity, gas, water, sewer, telephone, sanitation and cable television. According to McDonough, he would have to spend more money on necessary utilities to keep his coffee business afloat.</p>\n<p>“I do not like the utilities tax,” McDonough said. “I own a coffee shop and I use so much utility every day. A utilities tax raise would cost me more money.”</p>\n<p>McDonough also said he does not see the reason behind transient taxes, a tax aimed at out-of-towners who stay at a hotel or motel, because there are no hotels in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As for the transient tax, we do not even have any hotels in Isla Vista so I do not see the point in transient taxes,” McDonough said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he believes the proposed party registration tax is not a “real” tax because it is not implemented anywhere else.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61229\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61229\" data-attachment-id=\"61229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/community-members-brainstorm-ideas-for-service-funding/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424482130\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000125\",\"title\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61229\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Community members, such as Jay Freeman, above, brainstorm ideas for service funding.

It realistically would not work. I have never even heard of this anywhere else.”</p>\n<p>Doctor and founder of the Isla Vista Clinic David Bearman said the property tax option will not affect students because it is paid indirectly.</p>\n<p>“Students can have their own jobs or rely on their parents to supply them with money,” Bearman said. “Therefore, they do not pay for it directly. They pay for it very indirectly.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-61245\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>(Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Police Department (UCPD) hosted its annual Lighting and Safety Walk Thursday evening to inspect light posts and light bulbs on campus in an effort to make the university safer and more light-efficient.</p>\n<p>UCPD officers, university staff, administrators, professors, students and Campus Security Officers (CSO) participated in the event with the goal of making the university a more secure environment at night. The event split participants into three groups and covered three different walking routes: behind Davidson Library; from Girvetz Hall to the Student Resource Building (SRB); near the bus loop and the RecCen. Each group was led by a UCPD officer, two university staff members and two CSOs.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fisher said safety involves “adequate lighting” on campus, and Administrative Services strives to address lighting issues every year.</p>\n<p>“It is very important for people to feel safe within the community,” Fisher said. “We have been working on new lighting projects for the past twelve years, since I have personally been here.”</p>\n<p>According to Fisher, old round light bulbs, also called “Johnny Balls,” will be replaced in every walkway with newer and stronger white lighting.</p>\n<p>“We have replaced fixtures such as Johnny Balls,” Fisher said. “Our goal is to have most of those replaced throughout the walkways. We want a whiter light everywhere and we see lighting deficiency right now, but it will be improved.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said the university is installing new lighting because the currently-placed bulbs are an outdated brand that contribute to light pollution.</p>\n<p>“The old Johnny Balls were created in the 1960s, but we are replacing the old style fixtures,” Fisher said. “These globe lights produce sky globes, and one of the goals of the campus is to change this because in an environmental perspective, it spills light into the sky for color rendition and we want light on the ground as opposed to the sky.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and UCPD Patrol Sergeant Matt Blime said bright lighting prevents crime from occurring on campus and allows students to feel more safe on campus at night.</p>\n<p>“I think proper lighting on campus is a deterrence for crime,” Blime said. “If a person is looking to commit a crime, it is less likely that they will do it in an area that is very well lit. At the same time, it gives students more of a sense of safety and security while walking on the campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Blime, serious crimes on campus have been less frequent over the past year due to student participation in safety-related events.</p>\n<p>“We want to promote safety, for everyone here,” Blime said. “We have had a reduction of serious crime in the past year. We have had a 10-20 percent decrease in crimes and it has become more popular for students to participate in these walks and create more safety because we address concerns.”</p>\n<p>Campus Senior Electrical Utility Lead Jim Morrison said a person’s facial expression is more visible under whiter light, which would expose the intentions of a potential perpetrator before a crime is committed.</p>\n<p>“We want more white light,” Morrison said. “During the summer months, they stay on for nine hours and 13 hours in the winter time. If you have a whiter light, you can see facial expressions more. Before a crime, you can see if people look ticked-off and this light makes it possible to see.”</p>\n<p>Biology graduate student graduate Emily Ellis said it is discomforting to walk to her car at night in the dark after late classes.</p>\n<p>“The animals that I study are nocturnal,” Ellis said. “I am happy to stay for experiments, but it is unnerving when it is pitch black and I am the only person on campus. I definitely walk faster and only go towards areas where it is well-lit.”</p>\n<p>Ellis said she worries about her students’ safety when they leave her class at 10 p.m. because the Life Sciences Building currently does not have sufficient lighting due to construction at Davidson Library.</p>\n<p>“It is good to see what is around you and to feel safe as if you are in your own home,” Ellis said. “I worry for them because you never know what can happen.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, administrators and police officers have demonstrated throughout the years that they are invested in ensuring student safety.</p>\n<p>“This type of event is really assuring that people care about the student concerns. It seems like the administrators and UCPD officers really care about the opinions of students. The survey that was sent out via email recently is an example of this as well.”</p>\n<p>CSO officer and fourth-year Chican@ studies major Melissa Cruz said theft is the most common crime on campus. According to her, theft occurs frequently because darkness facilitates stealing.</p>\n<p>“I have been a CSO for three years and the lights have always been important,” Cruz said, “It brightens up the campus and deters people from stealing things. Stealing is the biggest issue here at UCSB, especially stealing bikes.”</p>\n<p>Cruz said CSO flashlights can only do so much to prevent theft at night and that the new installation of lights will help significantly more in preventing crime.</p>\n<p>“If somebody looks suspicious, we only flash our lights at them,” Cruz said. “But if there are lights then it can prevent them from stealing bikes.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I.V. residents showed support by honking car horns, cheering on protesters and by joining the protest.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major and event attendee Kevin Villar said he relates to the evicted families because of his personal experience with a similar situation that occurred in his hometown.</p>\n<p>“This situation has a huge impact on me because my family and I got evicted during my childhood at apartments that we used to live at,” Villar said. “It makes me angry to see the reality that most landlords in I.V. only care about profit.”</p>\n<p>Villar also said the evictions may have been particularly “traumatic” for children of the evicted families who may have thereafter been exposed to inappropriate aspects of I.V. culture.</p>\n<p>“Just think of the kids and the traumatic experiences of not having a home. They deal with that fact that there will always be drunken students on the street and see drugs weekly,” Villar said. “Yet they still get evicted, which is injustice.”</p>\n<p>Former I.V. resident Maria Hernandez, who was among those evicted from the Abrego Villas, said her family prefers to live in I.V. and that the eviction has been particularly difficult because she is a single mother who provides for other family members.</p>\n<p>“It affected us so much. I live in Goleta but I would rather live in Isla Vista much more because my family prefers to be here,” Hernandez said. “I believe it is an injustice, especially because I am a single mother who supports my children and grandchildren.”</p>\n<p>Another evicted tenant from the Abrego Villas, Valentina Hernandez, said she believes it was racist of the landlord to evict her and her family.</p>\n<p>“It is discrimination because they initially said they were not going to kick us out,” Valentina Hernandez said. “I believe it is a racist act because they still do not have anyone living there, not even new students who can afford it. They said that they would reconstruct the building and slowly let us back into homes.”</p>\n<p>Valentina Hernandez said she has been living in different hotels and homes since she was evicted and said she feels like she has not been told the entire truth regarding her eviction situation by her landlord or the property management company.</p>\n<p>“I have been living in several motels since then. My daughter’s a school teacher and has also felt bad for us and housed us as well. I feel like a refugee,” Valentina Hernandez said. “I think this type of thing happens every now and then but I feel lied to and discriminated against.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60381\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60381\" data-attachment-id=\"60381\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/protesters-march-through-isla-vista-in-objection-of-evictions/ivtu-march_kenneth-song-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422629444\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"26\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60381\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C266\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60381\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Freebirds employee and I.V. resident for the past 13 years Briselda Martinez said she still does not have a permanent home and now lives in a place without a bathroom.</p>\n<p>“They did so much damage to us,” Martinez said. “I do not have a stable home still.

Jacinto Rodriguez said he joined the protest because he believes the evictions were an act of discrimination for the sake of profit.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it is racist and very wrong,” Rodriguez said, “We have nowhere else to live and it is not the same.”</p>\n<p>Rodriguez also said the evicted tenants do not deserve to be booted from their homes when they have insurance and good credit records.</p>\n<p>“This is an effort between everyone because they do not want to see my people evicted from Isla Vista. It is essential to have a roof over your head,” Rodriguez said. “In my case, they have checked my record, insurance and credit which is good and important, but they still evicted me.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60383\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60383\" data-attachment-id=\"60383\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/protesters-march-through-isla-vista-in-objection-of-evictions/ivtu-march_kenneth-song-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422630968\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60383\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C266\" alt=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-11\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alumnus and former I.V. resident Sharlene Macharia said it is vital that demonstrations bring attention to the eviction situation so that students and I.V. residents can collectively take action so those IVTU alleges were wronged can see justice, as well as to prevent similar instances from happening in the future.</p>\n<p>“I am glad that people are protesting and marching.

World War 2. <em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter in the Washington bureau of <em>New York Times</em> Eric Lichtblau spoke in Corwin Pavilion Monday night about how America became a safe haven for Hitler’s men in 1969 during the Cold War’s Operation Paperclip.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau presented recently discovered documents that discussed how Nazis were used as spies and scientists by the U.S. military and intelligence services in order to aid the race against the Soviet Union to reach the moon in 1969 via Operation Paperclip. The talk ended with a free book signing in honor of Litchtblau’s latest book entitled <em>The Nazis Next Door</em>, which took place at the entrance of Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>According to Lichblau, despite the American populous’ opposition to aiding Nazis, U.S. intelligence agencies undertook various secret efforts to protect them once they got to American soil.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that Nazis in America were paid with commodities for their work during what he called a “horribly difficult truth” in American history.</p>\n<p>“They were perceived as lazy, filthy, thieves, liars and double agents,” Lichtblau said. “But, they were still used by the U.S. in times of war and were offered packs of cigarettes and alcohol in return.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969 – Pulitzer Prize-winner Eric Lichtblau</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lichtblau, the living conditions of Nazis in America were “shameful” because they were “easily” allowed to live in the U.S. while their Jewish victims “horribly” suffered in concentration camps.</p>\n<p>“The ease of allowing Nazis in America, in my view, is shameful and is a really untold period in postwar history as thousands of Nazis came to America after the war,” Lichtblau said. “It was horribly easy for them to come and horribly difficult for the liberation of Jews in America. I cringe at this sight.”</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that although Nazi scientists aided American scientists in developing technology to go the moon in 1969, their cooperation with the government is considered “horrible.”</p>\n<p>“Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969,” Lichtblau said, “Without them, we realistically might not have entered the moon in 1969,”</p>\n<p>Litchblau also said that there were a few “good” spies that helped the U.S. perform tasks that they could not accomplish on their own.</p>\n<p>“There were some good Nazi spies that translated documents, control zones of Europe, intercepting cables, and doing other tasks that the U.S. could not do themselves,” Litchblau said, “Some of these were anti-Soviet spies whom were rewarded.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S. I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong. – First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Litchblau, the anticommunist sentiments shared by the U.S. and Nazis in America allowed Americans to channel anticommunist Nazi sentiment into work.</p>\n<p>“Anticommunists sentiments were behind the Nazi achievements because the U.S. was against communism and this helped,” Litchblau said. “There was a notion that nobody hated the Soviets more than the Nazis and the U.S. wanted to put this hatred to work.”</p>\n<p>First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim said he was alarmed that Nazis were secretly protected by the American government and that the actions of the intelligence agencies “feels gross.”</p>\n<p>“I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S.,” Jim said. “I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Ashley Miller however said Lichtblau’s talk changed her previously held perspectives on Nazis.</p>\n<p>“Currently knowing that Nazis aided Americans with scientific and spy-related achievements, it helps me to see them as a little less worse than I previously thought of them,” Miller said. “It is mind-blowing to have my perspective change.”</p>\n<p>Psychology professor Kristen Macuga said she was “quite shocked” to learn about Operation Paperclip, since she grew up in the post Pearl Harbor-era where the U.S. was portrayed as heroic in the post-World War II historical narrative.</p>\n<p>“It is quite shocking to know this,” Macuga said. “I was born weeks after Pearl Harbor in a place that made it seem that Americans were heroes who freed Jews from concentration camps. It is shocking to know that we allowed Nazis to aid us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60168\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60168\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/","id":2929,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2928,2927,2926],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Main Office, located inside the MultiCultural Center. The proposed entrance would allow entrance to the A.S. Office from the exterior of the building, unlike than the interior entrance that currently exists. <em>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Associated Students President Ali Guthy presented a proposal to create a new entrance to the A.S. Main Office in the MultiCultural Center (MCC) during <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/\">last week’s A.S. Senate meeting</a> in response to what she claims is student-need as described in the Vision 2020 A.S. Student Strategic Plan.</p>\n<p>The proposal, according to Guthy, is a response to the A.S. Student Strategic Plan released in Spring 2014, which laid out A.S.’s goals for the next five years. Under the proposal, the second floor of the outdoor MCC patio area will be changed to a conference room that will be predominantly used by A.S. officials.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year sociology and psychology major Guthy, there are plenty of reasons to have a new entrance, since she claims that the current space is “bunker-like” and “inaccessible” to students.</p>\n<p>“Although the association has done its best to advertise its location, the bunker-like structure inhibits open access to the space and its resources,” Guthy said. “Associated Students is funded entirely by students and serves to facilitate student needs. I find it troubling that this space isn’t readily open and accessible to all students, given that students are the ones paying for it.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many generations of students have been asking for greater accessibility to these spaces and such a change will benefit future students. – AS President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>MCC office manager Enma Elias however said that the idea of a new entrance is “nice,” but that MCC employees would like things to stay the same.</p>\n<p>“It definitely would be nice to see this proposal, but from what I know, we want to keep things the same,” Elias said. “Especially because the outdoor patio area outside of the MCC entrance is always used for conferences each summer and spring by people outside of UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Although the proposal has not been approved by Senate, Guthy said it will benefit future students, particularly student leaders, for informational purposes.</p>\n<p>“Future student leaders, over the next few years, could continue to contribute information to this space and feature information that they find necessary,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>MCC co-chair and third year film &amp; media studies major Ashley Baker said she opposes Guthy’s plan because Guthy did not ask for input from the MCC co-chairs.</p>\n<p>“I do not like the idea of this proposal at all. Ali did not have the courtesy to discuss this with [co-chair Anumita Kaur] and I, and I find that extremely unfair,” Baker said in an email.</p>\n<p>“As MCC co-chairs we should have been involved in the process of developing this idea as this construction will absolutely obstruct MCC affairs.”</p>\n<p>According to Baker, Guthy’s proposal, if acted upon, could obstruct other non-student government bodies from properly organizing.</p>\n<p>“The MCC is the only place that marginalized groups (people of color and/or LGBTQ) have to organize, study and have social/political gatherings,” Baker said in an email.</p>\n<p>However, Guthy said students have always had a specific demand for greater accessibility to the A.S. Main Office.</p>\n<p>“Many generations of students have been asking for greater accessibility to these spaces and such a change will benefit future students,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>According to Elias, the current lack of space on campus will only be exacerbated should plans for the new entrance come to fruition.</p>\n<p>“Corwin Pavilion has a patio right outside of our main entrance. Corwin needs their space as well and I don’t think they’d like that idea,” Elias said. “UCen lacks space too and all these building are near so it’s all relative: There’s a lack of space … It’s actually really cramped in here.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Productive for the privileged, but what about folks who are disadvantaged? – MCC co-chair Ashley Baker</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth-year film &amp; media studies major and MCC media designer A.J. Price said she also does not agree with Guthy’s proposal and plans to “vote against it for sure” if it is proposed to the student body.</p>\n<p>Second-year French and economics-accounting major and Democratic Process (DP) party senator Steven Kwok however said the new entrance would be beneficial because it would provide students with direct access to the A.S. Main Office and would thus allow students to be “more connected to their government.”</p>\n<p>“I think the new entrance to the MCC is a great idea,” Kwok said in an email. “The student body will be able to directly access AS through the entrance instead of having to enter through the hall that extends to the main corridor of the MCC. This gives AS a face to the outside beyond the lettering that is currently on the building.”</p>\n<p>Former Open People’s Party (OPP) senator and fourth-year political science major Marvin Ramirez said the university lacks student space and that students can benefit “greatly” from the new space should it be constructed.</p>\n<p>“Seeing as people out in I.V. are now charging students for their access to study spaces, spacing has been a large issue,” Ramirez said. “The university accepts more students which is awesome, but remains the same structurally inside. This cannot always be the case so a new conference room space may be of great value. Creating a new conference room that may potentially be a long-term investment is not a bad thing.”</p>\n<p>However, Baker said the proposal and conference room renovation is an example of what she alleges is elitist decision-making favoring “white and hetero-normative” OPP affiliates who she claims will not solve space issues that benefit people of color.</p>\n<p>“Productive for the privileged, but what about folks who are disadvantaged?” Baker said in an email. “Where are the fruits of their labor? We must note that the university was physically built and is still preserved by the muscle by countless economically deprived people of color. Look at how they have cornered El Centro with the library renovation.”</p>\n<p>According to Baker, enacting Guthy’s proposed renovation will continue to unevenly distribute space to a student group that has “more than enough.”</p>\n<p>“I do not believe this change to be necessary as they have more than enough space. Half of the university belongs to them. How inconsiderate can one be is my question?” Baker said in an email. “If this proposal is passed future generations will once again have to fight for an area that was already theirs.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59894\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59894\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/","id":2921,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2920,2919,2918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Locals Protest UC-Wide Tuition Hike","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students and faculty gathered at the Day of Education and Activism event yesterday in the Arbor to protest the proposed UC tuition increase of five percent over the next five years.

The Day of Education and Activism event aimed to bring attention to the UC’s failure to submit proper expenditure reports under the Assembly Bill No. 94 (AB 94) signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown in July 2013. </p>\n<p>According to Shari Sanders, Ph.D. candidate in comparative literature and the main organizer of Day of Education and Activism, students are unaware of the logistics behind the UC budget and must be educated on budget issues in order to prevent passive acceptance of tuition increases such as the increase to be approved by the UC Regents today. </p>\n<p>“The state of California has systematically been taking away education for decades,” Sanders said. “The last time students successfully opposed tuition increases was in 2009 and it is time to stand up in unity once more. If it were not for those student demonstrations, tuition would have been $15,000 more expensive.”</p>\n<p>Sanders said the UC has failed to fulfill its obligations via AB 94, which states that the UC must give reports breaking down expenditures for undergraduate and graduate student instruction and research. </p>\n<p>“Law AB 94 claims that the UC has to issue an accounting of where the money from the tuition goes and how it was spent,” Sanders said. “However, they recently failed to release this information to court and it has already been six weeks and nothing has been done.”</p>\n<p>Ph.D. candidate in ethnomusicology Aviva Milner-Brage said that her biggest concern with tuition increase is that low-income families and undocumented students are the ones most affected by the currently steep costs of attending a UC. </p>\n<p>“The undocumented students of low-income families are in tough situations,” Milner-Brage said,<br>\n“Their desire to earn degrees is so meaningful to them, and they have to fight even harder for their rights as students. It is not fair.”</p>\n<p>Sanders said she knew two students in a summer course who could not afford rent or a comfortable room to live in because of tuition increases.</p>\n<p>“In my summer class, out of 18 students, one student lived off a friend’s couch for $500 per month and one student was homeless,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>Milner-Brage said it is essential for Brown to fund the UC because the currently high rates of tuition are negatively affecting undergraduate and graduate students who will continue to face an increasing cost for public education.</p>\n<p>“The proposed five percent increase in tuition will only go higher as the years go by,” Sanders said. “Besides this, tuition has tripled the last fifteen years. Undergraduate and graduate students are affected alike, along with middle class families that do not qualify for financial aid.” </p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Gabriel Castro said although he is a recipient of financial aid, the tuition increases have continued to take a toll on his college career.</p>\n<p>“Grants and financial aid do not suffice,” Castro said. “I come from a low-income family. I’m going into debt with loans and it all places a large burden and pressure on me as a student.”</p>\n<p>According to Castro, many students face the challenge of graduating in debt and acquiring a job after graduation that does not fully pay back mounting student loans.</p>\n<p>“I, along with many of my college peers, am more discouraged to go to school each day knowing that my first job as a graduate will probably not cover everything that I owe,” Castro.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Edward Cruz said tuition increases have required him to have a very tight budget, negatively affecting his social life as well as his diet.</p>\n<p>“Because of my debt in loans … I cannot enjoy my evenings with friends at restaurants, movie theaters or concerts,” Cruz said. “This, more or less, ruins my college experience of going out with friends to nice things. On top of this, I cannot afford to buy groceries that are healthy.”</p>\n<p>According to feminist studies professor Eileen Boris, who spoke about topics at the event such as widespread difficulty to find a stable career, students can benefit from working together with professors in order to lower tuition as professors have prior experience with tuition increase issues and “depend on students to keep their careers afloat.”</p>\n<p>“Our jobs, as professors, would not exist without students,” Boris said. “It’s not only a moral and ethical reason to help students, it’s more about going against overpaid administrators that cause students to suffer financially. I’m also a parent which makes me more sensitive to the issue.”</p>\n<p>The event concluded with a march to Storke Tower, led by the Black Student Union (BSU). According to Sanders, the march served as an example that student protests cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>“I saw it as a wakeup call from apathy,” Sanders said. “It showed the strength of BSU student activists to make a sight that was impossible to ignore.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Park District and campus-based nonprofit La Escuelita hosted Safe Halloween this past Saturday, a free event for the children in I.V. held at the Children’s Park on Picasso Rd.</p>\n<p>The event included activities organized by various members of Greek life and booths decorated with festive items such as pumpkins, bats, ghosts, witches, confetti, paint, spider webs and candy. Activities at the event included a football toss, toilet paper toss, potato sack races, ring toss, fish pong, face painting, mini-golf and soccer bowling.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Recreation Coordinator Annie Aziz said the help of on-campus organizations made setting up this year’s event much easier than years past.</p>\n<p>“In the past, it was a lot harder because it was just I.V. Parks and Rec,” Aziz said. “I have much more support nowadays and it makes the event more successful and efficient. The on-campus organizations know how to organize, prepare and carry on events like this.”</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and third-year mechanical engineering major Lucia Arias said working Safe Halloween is a gratifying experience that causes participating children to “light up with joy.”</p>\n<p>“Many UCSB orgs participate and it is a heartwarming experience,” Arias said. “The kids appreciate it because it’s for them and they feel special since it’s a day catered to their fun for this holiday. They mostly appreciate how college students are around because they look up to us.”</p>\n<p>Lucia also said she hopes students keep other residents of I.V. — such as children — in mind when deciding how to handle this coming Halloween.</p>\n<p>“We as students do not really appreciate the space that we have in I.V.,” Arias said. “We can openly show families and residents that we are not here just to party. We want to acknowledge them through events like this.”</p>\n<p>Andrea Angulo, co-chair of La Escuelita and third-year Spanish and sociology major said Safe Halloween exemplifies a way in which students and other I.V. residents can come together in a safe, healthy and festive setting.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Safe Halloween that provides unity between UCSB, families and the children of Isla Vista to provide a safe space to Isla Vista,” Angulo said.</p>\n<p>Angulo also said children in I.V. do not get the chance to fully enjoy Halloween in their neighborhood because students are participating in “nightly parties inside of [their] community.”</p>\n<p>“From a kid’s perspective, it’s unfortunate to leave their community during Halloween day to have a good time. Isla Vista is simply not a safe place for children during this time period, especially during nighttime,” Angulo said. “I personally would not enjoy it if I were a kid and had to go trick-or-treating at a foreign neighborhood.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-grade student at Isla Vista Elementary School David Zamora said he has been coming to the event for the last few years and now recognizes some of the college students working at the booths.</p>\n<p>“I have been to this event since I was in third grade. I like the booths, the candy and the Halloween music they play,” Zamora said. “My friends come and I see familiar college students that I admire.”</p>\n<p>A mother of four, Isla Vista resident Janice Garcia said the presence of students throughout the day makes her feel better about the event.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a beautiful event because kids come during the day and there are fun games and candy. The fact that university students and parents are present during the day assures me that everything will be fine,” Garcia said. “I have lived in Isla Vista for 14 years and Halloween night can get ugly and sketchy. This is why I do not allow my children to be out during this time.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and Sigma Chi Omega president Jason Ouyang said Safe Halloween promotes consideration for children and other I.V. community members and that students should take heed of the event’s efforts.</p>\n<p>“It’s unfair that kids can’t have a safe time during Halloween, and it might be selfish on part of college students since we are having constant parties and drinking which is not good,” Ouyang said. “I appreciate everything that these orgs are doing. I don’t know how they organize it, but they do it well. Each booth is decorative and I support this event.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/","id":4753,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[4752,4751,4750],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/159"}},"__N_SSG":true}
