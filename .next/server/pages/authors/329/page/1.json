Lead singer Jackson Guthy — who happens to be A.S. President Ali Guthy’s musically inclined little brother — has opened for One Direction, Big Time Rush, Victoria Jackson, Cher Lloyd, Fifth Harmony, Emblem3 and 5 Seconds of Summer. Currently he’s signed to a label under Randy Jackson, and has become the American Idol judge’s newest prodigy. <em>Artsweek</em> reporter Heeba Kaleem sat down with Guthy and guitarist Michael O’Grady to get the scoop on the band’s origins, hair obsessions and what it’s like to work under a manager like Randy Jackson.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">Q: How did you guys meet?</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">Jackson: I met Michael on Tinder.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">Michael: It was love at first sight.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">Jackson: It was love at first swipe. Get it? I went on tour with Rob, my drummer, about a year and a half ago. After I got done with stuff I met up with Ron [again] and we were playing music with a bunch of different musicians. We were on set [with] this group of five guys and we all clicked really well together as a band, but also as friends. Now we just started this new project called North of Nine that we’re super stoked about.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">Q: What inspired you guys into music in the first place?</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">M: Well, I mean for me, I’ve been playing music my whole life.

I’ve played with a lot of different groups and jammed with a lot of different people. And what you kinda want to do is stick with it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">J: I got into music … I got a love and passion for music my whole life so I started playing when I was four. And then I’ve had the courtesy of being able to go out on the road a lot … and gain a lot of experiences. So it’s really cool now to be doing this project. It’s a lot different from the stuff I was doing.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">M: And I’ve been noticing, too, for us as a band, as North of Nine, [it] was a little gig, our first set rehearsal. I don’t think anybody really kind of expected it to go as well as it did because we ended up [with] — where was it Jackson — five, six new songs?</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">J: Yeah, [all] made up on the first day.

So Rob comes from Michigan, our drummer, Michael, comes from Ohio, Nolan’s from Kansas, I’m from here and then Edison, who’s our bass player, comes from Hong Kong. So all of our music styles blend in. There’s a bit of a draw from places where we’re from, I guess. But it’s definitely more up-tempo, like Rockfish with a little bit of a pop element. I’d say more modern rock and alternative, I guess.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">M: Which is a good thing for us because when you get together with musicians and you’re trying to do original material and if we all have different backgrounds, it helps blend and twist different styles to hopefully come up with something more original.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">J: I just wanted to say that Mike’s hair plays a big role.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">M: It’s very influential in the guys’ creative process, yes.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">J: I write most of my songs on Mike’s hair.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">M: Yeah, so if you wanna look up the meaning of our songs, it’s just coming down to the hair.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">Q: Why did you guys decide to call yourselves North of Nine?</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">J: It comes down to my mom, a lot. Cause when I was born … in 1996, she went to an astrologer and supposedly I was born in the year where all of the nine planets were aligned. My mom’s super into that, so she told me that story when I was young. But then she also has always said in life you’re going to have a lot of challenges and a lot of things that you have to overcome. It’s really important to set your true North — like, the thing you’re striving for. It definitely spawned a lot from my mom and I think it’s a humbling title and something to look forward to in my life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">M: I think that’s good too because it can kinda go hand in hand from your previous question of why we do this; ‘cause it’s something that’s true to us and we stick with it. We go through the bad times and the good times no matter what.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">Q: This is for Jackson.

I‘ve had the blessing to be able to work with a lot of the amazing, amazing people. You get a lot of stuff told along the way. People are like, this is your time. I remember signing with Universal and everyone telling me, oh, this is your time, everything is happening the right way. But you know, I never really felt fully comfortable in the situation … so I’m super stoked to be with Randy. I think it’s really awesome that Randy and I went from working on my solo project to working on North of Nine, which has definitely hit a lot more at home for me, which is why I feel the music is more real for me. It’s just something that comes out of me. This is the music that pours out of me when I sit at the piano. It’s humbling to be able to do that and Randy is amazing … he let me be my artistic side.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 12.6pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">Q: You are also our school’s president’s brother.

The band, formed in 2007 and composed of Parker Cannon (vocals), Kevin Geyer (guitar/vocals), Kelen Capener (bass), Ryan Torf (drums) and William Levy (guitar), has worked together since they were out of middle school and have signed under Pure Noise Records. Since then, they have performed at the 2014 Vans Warped Tour, along with both national and international tours in Japan, Europe and Australia. Their second studio album <em>What You Don’t See </em>(2013) debuted 46 on The Billboard 200 and placed ninth on British magazine <em>Rock Sounds</em> “The 50 Best Albums Of 2013” list. The album sold 13,000 copies its first week and has also placed #1 Vinyl, #8 Alternative, and #8 Independent on Billboard’s charts. The band is currently on a nationwide headlining tour along with bands like Stick To Your Guns, Heart to Heart, Rotting Out, and more.</p>\n<p>Songs like “Right Here” and “All Wrong” capture the The Story So Far’s sound and shows off the edgier version of pop punk. Their honest and aggressive lyrics, coupled with their unique Californian sound, are what earned them a loyal fan following which continues to grow. Although heavy guitars and raspy screaming are a common occurrence in their discography, they also have acoustic, softer songs like “Clairvoyant” and “Navy Blue” that don’t lose the band’s trademark sincerity in their lyrics. The songs are sweet and poignant, yet still cutting in their message. The Story So Far is definitely a band to look out for as they continue to gain recognition for their talent throughout the country.</p>\n<p><em>The Story So Far will be performing at Velvet Jones in Downtown Santa Barbara on October 15 at 7:30pm. Admission is $18.</em></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false;

In addition to being the first Executive Dean, Marshall has served on various campus organizations such as the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on Budget Strategy and the Chancellor’s Advisory Council on Campus Climate. He has also helped found UCSB’s COLLABORATE, an organization that promotes effective use of technologies as a support for instruction.</p>\n<p>Marshall said his previous experience as the Dean of Humanities and UCSB’s interdisciplinary and collaborative culture have allowed him to become involved in many partnerships with other schools and academic divisions as well as deal with issues such as budget, space planning and enrollment. As an active member of UC committees and programs, Marshall said he plans to work with students, alumni and administration on education while also focusing more specifically on issues in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to working with the UCSB community to develop an academic plan that will allow us to fulfill our mission as a leading research university dedicated to education and public service.” Marshall said in an email. “In addition, I will be working closely with the Chancellor as we take important steps to address the problems associated with Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Dean of the College of Letters and Science Melvin Oliver, who has worked closely with Marshall, said the College of Letters and Science will continue collaboration with Marshall on various initiatives and challenges that affect the CLS.</p>\n<p>“Some of the main areas we’ll address in the coming year are the quality and diversity of our faculty; adapting to the changing instructional environment that includes online and hybrid classes; and ensuring that we are able to offer enough courses for students to have timely completion of their degree objectives,” Oliver said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he created the EVC Search Advisory Committee with consultation from various other committees such as Academic Senate Committee on Committees, Associated Students and Graduate Students Association for membership. He said the committee hired an executive search firm to help decide from dozens of applications.</p>\n<p>“The history of his leadership and service to our campus is both broad and deep. I was pleased and excited that Dr. Marshall assumed the new EVC position,” Yang said in an email. Marshall said he was humbled to have been selected from such a talented pool of applicants for the position.</p>\n<p>“I am sure that there were many strong candidates and I am honored to have been selected.” Marshall said in an email.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/","id":3476,"author":{"id":329,"name":"Heeba Kaleem"},"related":[3475,3474,3473],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/329"}},"__N_SSG":true}
