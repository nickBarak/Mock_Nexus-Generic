Each student employee affected by UCPath will receive $150 after taxes, and employees with paycheck issues that spanned more than one month will receive additional compensation up to a maximum of $450.</p>\n<p>This agreement did not address backpay, overpayments or other issues.</p>\n<p>Throughout the protest, several speakers took the floor to discuss their frustrations with UCPath as well as with the path to achieving restitution.</p>\n<p>Some speakers mentioned personal anecdotes about how they had been affected with UCPath; one student worker, Department of Chicano Studies PhD student Mariano Nava Botello, had his car repossessed because he was not getting paid on time, according to a petition posted to the UAW Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Sheila Kulkarni, one of the speakers and a first-year chemistry graduate student at UCSB, expressed frustrations about how the university is dealing with UCPath issues.</p>\n<p>“I shouldn’t have to be in the Chancellor’s office to solve payroll issues or yell about my problems at Storke Tower,” Kulkarni said. “I never should have had to experience this nonsense in the first place.”</p>\n<p>After the speakers, the group of students and workers began their march, walking from Storke tower, through the Arbor walkway to finish at Cheadle Hall. Over the course of the march, the group maintained constant chants that advocated for workers’ rights on campus, such as, “One day longer, one day stronger.”</p>\n<p>As the protestors collected around Cheadle Hall, they again formed a group and reiterated the reasons behind the march through a microphone before walking into the administration building, where they searched for someone within the budget department to help the student workers with more serious financial problems caused by UCPath.</p>\n<p>After the issues with UCPath began in August 2018, UAW 2865 and the Graduate Student Association joined teams to address the university with their grievances.</p>\n<p>That partnership began pushing out surveys in October for students affected by UCPath in order to gather information on the extent of the payment problems.</p>\n<p>Providing proof of the issues of UCPath has been no small task, according to UAW sergeant-in-arms and graduate student, Lisa August-Schmidt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been asked as a union to prove that people haven’t been paid, so we have to file every single case individually and provide every single name,” August-Schmidt said.</p>\n<p>UCPath will be <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-01/ucpath-system-outage-to-occur-due-to-integration-of-new-uc-campuses/\">implemented</a> at two other UC campuses — UC Berkeley and UC Davis — during the month of March.

written by Off-Campus Senators Christian Ornelas and Rafael Cornejo.</p>\n<p>The purpose of these Facebook accounts is to help increase senators’ accountability and transparency, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Previously, students had a difficult time finding relevant information regarding Senate, the resolution added.</p>\n<p>“When we give updates, a lot of them will be on our personal social media accounts, which [may] not always be public or as accessible as we would like it to be,” Ornelas said during Wednesday night’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Senators are required to “continuously update these pages with their current office hours, project updates, and any other relevant information.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Ornelas said an added benefit of Facebook is that it allows users to visit a page without needing to have an account for themselves.</p>\n<p>“As long as they’re able to see that content then that’s super beneficial,” he said.</p>\n<p>There will also be a university announcement sent out to the student body to make them aware of the newly created Facebook accounts.</p>\n<p>These accounts must be created by the end of Week 2 of Winter Quarter 2019 and will be linked on the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate website by the end of the third week for both winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>Ornelas is responsible for making these updates to the website.</p>\n<p>The resolution also says senators should be making a larger effort to expand beyond their personal accounts to provide this information for the student body.</p>\n<p>Ornelas said he drew inspiration for the resolution from UC Berkeley and added that UCSB senator’s accounts would be modeled after those of Berkeley’s senators.</p>\n<p>The requirement of public Facebook pages will be later written into legal code with the senate’s approval, the resolution states.</p>\n<p><i>Aaron Berkness is a reporter at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Their students, in turn, are unable to access several tools, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elrod said there is a “variety of benefits” that employees get, but the lack of registration has resulted in them not receiving the benefits to which they are entitled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UAW 2865 and Graduate Student Association (GSA) have been working together in an attempt to help students avoid losing benefits and payment for their work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve written up a collective survey together that we’ve been circulating on our list serves, sending to our department reps in GSA on Facebook, trying to get as many graduate students as possible who are having issues to respond to it,” GSA President Cierra Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Student workers] should also recognize that the only way to speak to the university as an equal would be through… [a] collective response,” Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCPath malfunction has also affected undergraduate students who work within the school as tutors or readers, according to Daniel Lazar, one of the UAW 2865 Head Stewards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union stated that they are working closely with the GSA to make sure students do not feel as though they are isolated and to make sure the university upholds their end of the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The larger issue is whether students will band together to bring attention to the issue, Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lazar also expressed frustration over the university’s lack of quick and detailed responses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’ve just been stonewalling and haven’t responded. I’ve actually gotten contradictory information about the causes of the error… It’s clearly a university-wide problem, and there hasn’t been a university-wide response to it,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Union objected to the transition to UCPath from the start because these issues had already occurred at other universities last year. Despite this, the university proceeded with the transition, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the issues are not resolved soon, UCPath members will not receive their October paychecks, leaving students unsure of their ability to pay rent, according to McClelland.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.6 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84532\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84532\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/","id":2196,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2195,2194,2193],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Title IX Policy Changes Explained By Student Advisory Board Representative","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-10-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SENATE_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SENATE_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UC-wide sexual violence and sexual harassment policy is currently in a formal review period.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Update [Nov. 19]: UCOP later contested the validity of Selvidge’s statements.

Senate on Wednesday, highlighting the specific changes and non-changes to the policy.</p>\n<p>The UC-wide sexual violence and sexual harassment policy is currently in a formal review period.</p>\n<p>The policy previously stated that all graduate students were mandatory reporters of any sexual harassment or violence. Now, graduate students are only mandatory reporters when “we’re in our capacity as an employee,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>“We are not particularly well trained in this,” she said. “We have sort of a one-hour… online training that covers explanations of all of sexual violence, all of sexual harassment, stalking, dating and domestic violence … It’s really not enough to have us understand how to respond sensitively.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge emphasized that all other student employees who are paid by the university remain “responsible employees,” meaning they are required to report to the Title IX office in the event that they become aware of sexual violence or harassment committed against another student while they are acting as employees.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed changes to the definition of consent. The committee now defines consent as “unable to understand the…nature of sexual activity due to…alcohol and drugs.”</p>\n<p>The policy’s change says the student would need to be incapacitated for consent to be questioned, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the formal investigation time period has been increased from sixty calendar days to ninety business days.</p>\n<p>She explained the change stemmed from the university, stating they have struggled with finding enough time to complete investigations within the sixty 60 calendar day time restraint limit in the past.</p>\n<p>The student’s decision of whether or not they want a formal investigation is now not a determining factor of whether they actually get a formal investigation, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>“The university will investigate things without people’s consent,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the Title IX policy that Selvidge outlined in her presentation was in regards to the sexual assault of minors.</p>\n<p>UCSB does not consider statutory rape to be sexual assault, according to Selvidge. She pointed out that the university is trying to keep in mind 17-year-olds and their dating life.</p>\n<p>However, several graduate students at the GSA meeting expressed their concern for their own children living on campus. It worried them that the university does not see the possible rape of their children as sexual assault, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed the new revision to the definition of sexual assault penetration and contact, which now includes language that is more inclusive toward the LGBTQ+ community, as well as male victims.</p>\n<p>“I am actually very happy with this particular change. This is something that I worked on convincing them for several years,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Power imbalances, such as the dynamic between a teacher assistant and a student, are now taken into consideration as aggravating circumstances in the new policy, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Relationship violence has also been expanded to include non-physical conduct such as the abuse of a pet or the destruction of property.</p>\n<p>The Title IX Student Advisory Board consists of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members.</p>\n<p>Currently, the undergraduate position for UCSB is vacant. Students who are interested should contact Ariana Alvarez, the Title IX Officer for UCSB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/","id":2211,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2210,2209,2208],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/64"}},"__N_SSG":true}
