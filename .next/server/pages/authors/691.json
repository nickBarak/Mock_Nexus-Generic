In 2018, artists broke down their own personal barriers to share full-length declarations of love, loss and struggle – showing both depth and versatility. Upon weeks of reflection, and the start of the new year, here are 10 of the best albums of the year.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Room 25</em> by Noname</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Room 25 is an extremely conscientious record where Noname toys with soulful sounds and finds a newfound elegance. She manages to find great power in nimble basslines and gentle string sections that support the exploration of her confidence as a young, black woman. The instrumentals are refined enough to create a wonderful flow, but not to the point where they lose their natural groove. This really is a soothing album that makes well-needed admissions to the struggles in creativity for rappers – which are often times brought upon by racial tension.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Die Lit</em> by Playboi Carti</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While it was largely overlooked by self-proclaimed hip-hop connoisseurs, Playboi Carti’s sophomore album Die Lit is a generational landmark in trap music. The rapper’s ingenious adlib repetition along with the hypnotic production is a high point in this a new wave of refined rap minimalism. Filled with countless bangers and trap lullabies, Die Lit garnered a subtle buzz from fans all year. It’s an addictive project, to say the least.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Sweetener</em> by Ariana Grande</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ariana Grande is one of – if not the – biggest name in pop right now. Though she struggled with major tragedies and losses in love, she takes these moments and fuses them together to deliver a cohesive package of eccentric pop ballads. Beds of lavish and elegant strings serve to make Grande’s voice voluminous and powerful unlike ever before. A skilled hand from legendary producer Pharrell helps Grande convey her fragmented emotions through spectacular vocals.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Wide Awake!</em> by Parquet Courts</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wide Awake! Is a testament to the music world that punk and underground hardcore are everlasting scenes, which can be just as powerful as they were in decades past. Parquet Courts shifts punk into a new gear and gives listeners a mixed bag of accentuated riffs alongside incredible bass lines that elevate the grunge aesthetic. The band uses hints of nostalgia in a true rock-and-roll fashion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>7</em> by Beach House</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dedicated to the indie population, 7 encapsulates Beach House’s best transcription of musical emotions. The duo spins dreamy synths and rock instrumentals to dazzle listeners from track to track, while the album progresses in an immaculate motion. Beach House comes through with a refreshing level of experimentation that sculpts together a new sound which establishes them as progressive innovators.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Daytona</em> by Pusha T</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">G.O.O.D Music rapper Pusha T has had an eventful year, partly due to the fact that he has been in a back-and-forth battle with music industry Goliath, Drake. Nevertheless, his choice of battle is what makes Pusha T so undeniably addictive to listen to and in Daytona, an entirely Kanye West-produced project, Pusha T continues to prove just how ruthless he is. Throughout the seven-song tracklist Pusha T utilizes his nonstop arrogance in order to fine-tune a flow that makes his dark voice intoxicating. On Daytona, we are given unmerciful bars that solidify Pusha T as a menace of the rap game that should not be battled with.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Isolation</em> by Kali Uchis</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following her well-rounded record Por Vida in 2015, centered around eclectic jams, Kali Uchis has delivered the quintessential pop fantasy album Isolation. Uchis takes listeners through a surreal rollercoaster that travels through some of the most luxurious and gloomiest of landscapes. The sensual singer unravels a variety of emotions that glide along effortlessly. Isolation consist of dreamy melodies that accents Uchis’s angelic vocals perfectly with a level of versatility that brings her into the spotlight.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Some Rap Songs</em> by Earl Sweatshirt</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through excellent lyricism and a unique discography with complex wordplay, Odd Future native Earl Sweatshirt has earned himself a spot in the top list of current generation rappers. As his career progresses, his music takes a darker, lo-fi approach. This is exemplified throughout his flow in Some Rap Songs, which remains top tier as per usual but becomes much more experimental with jazzy, minimalistic production. Some Rap Songs is an inward-looking compilation of work, which allows listeners to explore just exactly what is going on through the mind of Earl Sweatshirt.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Kids See Ghosts</em> by Kids See Ghosts </strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After months of speculation and isolating himself in Wyoming, in a matter of two weeks, Kanye West provided a back-to-back delivery of two impeccable projects which continue to solidify his instinctive production and masterful flow. On Ye, we are given a version of Kanye unlike those of the past. He dabbles in a diabolical approach that taps into some of his innermost demons. West explores his relationship with himself, allowing us to see a more vulnerable side. On Kids See Ghosts, the self-titled collaborative effort between West and Kid Cudi, West brings out an energy from Cudi unlike any other. Both Cudi and West play over West’s production of monstrous samples with triumphant delivery – capturing yet another monumental project in the career of the two rappers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Negro Swan</em> by Blood Orange</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blood Orange is an artistic effort created by the singer-songwriter Devonté Hynes. On his most recent project, Negro Swan, we are given a side of Hynes that shows his multifaceted ability to tell complex narratives and reincarnate tender sounds which are culturally significant and impactful for the black community. Hynes has shined throughout the years by lending his songwriting abilities to big name artist such as Solange, FKA Twigs and even A$AP Rocky. This time, he has used his impeccable ear for pop and songwriting abilities to create a project of his own. Negro Swan works to give people a collection of beautiful harmonies and sensual grooves that define Hynes as a sonically driven artist.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rewind to 2012: You see a crew of mischievous young rappers being followed around by teenagers in skate merch decorated with kittens, upside-down crosses and sprinkled donuts. This was all led by one tall, gap-toothed and loud individual who goes by the name of Tyler, the Creator. Combine this with a bunch of debauchery and banter from elderly folks claiming that their kids are being brainwashed, and you’ve got yourself a group called Odd Future. On the cusp of their infamy, they decided to take on a ridiculous festival that has come to be known as Camp Flog Gnaw. On the seventh year of its illustrious run, Tyler has taken the monumental Dodger Stadium and transformed it into a ballpark for misfits with a stacked lineup of prominent artists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two-day festival first emerged in the form of a carnival, established by the noteworthy ferris wheel overlooking Los Angeles.The foundation of the carnival is the youth who have loved Tyler’s outlandish approach to the music world and fashion and have stuck around to build an empire with the most diverse fanbase up to date. The dark night was filled with bodies wandering through the ballpark covered by sprinkles of ash from the forest fires and cradled by the eccentric music that pounded from bass-heavy speakers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the “Camp” and “Flog” stages provided lethal performances from impressive artists ranging from the likes of young Indie icons Rex Orange County and hypebeast phenomenon Playboi Carti to boy band Brockhampton, while the “Gnaw” stage had significantly lower numbers in comparison. Despite the terrible air conditions, attendees shined in fluorescent outfits to scounder through the new venue in search of the best way to get the most out of the first of the two-day festival. The stadium was perfectly designed with beautiful flower patterns; deep-fried food scents lingered throughout, and people lined up for classic “Adventureland”-esque ring tossing games. Ultimately, everyone found solace in jumping in or sitting around crowds to enjoy the music. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowds moshed heavily during sets like that of Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti. His sticky ad-libs and braggadocious lyricism, combined with toxic instrumentals, unleashed savage behavior and raised everyone’s adrenaline to a maximum capacity. Meanwhile, Indie-heads simultaneously danced passionately on the opposite end of the venue to Rex Orange County tracks like “Loving Is Easy” and helped further establish how the festival is far from being filled with unidimensional music enthusiasts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kali Uchis took her sensuality to the stage to put on a stellar performance with guitar solos and a guest appearance from The Internet’s Steve Lacy — who also performed earlier in the day — for standout track “Your Teeth In My Neck.” After a passionate performance from the Flog Gnaw founder himself, Tyler, the Creator, during which he channeled a variety of faces to help sing along to tracks that ranged from “Goblin” to “Flower Boy” and at least one track from everything in between, the night capped off with a ruthless performance from the unapologetic “G.O.O.D Music” rapper Pusha T. The infamous rapper put on a pure, captivating performance, creating a diverse setlist with his latest fully Kanye West-produced project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daytona, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and songs from 2013’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Name Is My Name</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pusha took the atmosphere to the next degree with live installments of Clipse track “Grindin’ ” and even his Kanye West collab “New God Flow” to close out the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before it even began, day two of the festival had established itself as legendary simply based off of the lineup of musical enigmas like Ms. Lauryn Hill and the Kid Cudi/Kanye West duo, Kids See Ghosts. Early on, people stood in enormous lines for the overpriced </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kids See Ghosts</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> merchandise and Camp Flog Gnaw memorabilia. Nevertheless, sets from Taco and even Jaden Smith made for a perfect ending to fans’ anticipations. Taco enthralled the audience with the furious pounding from his trap-heavy DJ set, and Smith’s enthusiasm kept the environment lively. Soon enough, class was in session as Ms. Lauryn Hill took the stage and entranced the crowd with beautiful ballads from her iconic debut, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It was truly an impactful moment as she held her very own resurgence of soul at the carnival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As time passed, bodies rushed to the “Camp” stage and moved in close for Kids See Ghosts. The Cudi-Kanye dynamic duo hovered in a glass box that towered over the stage. The crowd flooded in as Metro Boomin’s signature line, “If Young Metro don’t trust you I’m gon’ shoot you,” played and the beat dropped in their collaborative effort, “Father Stretch My Hands Pt.1,” off of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Life of Pablo.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The two icons went through all seven tracks from their </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kids See Ghosts</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album and dabbled in playing classic anthems like “Paranoid” and “Pursuit of Happiness.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the two jumped inside the transparent cube, voices joined and screamed lyric after lyric. In this crowd, along with the many others of the two days, there was one frequent face that shined with the most profound responses. Tyler sang along and danced to different performances with a genuine passion in such a childlike manner, proving that he’s honed his own personal playground and shares his enthusiasm for virtuosity. Tyler and Odd Future’s impact has been incredible and crucial for motivating the youth’s creativity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camp Flog Gnaw will forever provide a unique home for those who were stigmatized as slackers for wilding out to classic </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bastard</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-era Tyler, the Creator, trying to skate around and find for a place of acceptance. Although his own content has changed quite a bit, Tyler’s influence remains unchallenged and consequently proves just how significant of a role Camp Flog Gnaw plays in the live festival scene. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/camp-flog-gnaw-2018-a-festival-for-misfits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/camp-flog-gnaw-2018-a-festival-for-misfits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/camp-flog-gnaw-2018-a-festival-for-misfits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/camp-flog-gnaw-2018-a-festival-for-misfits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/camp-flog-gnaw-2018-a-festival-for-misfits/","id":6609,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6608,6607,6606],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Halloween’: In Review","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/halloween-2018-1536161981.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/halloween-2018-1536161981.jpg?resize=480%2C240&ssl=1","description":"“Halloween” having yet another sequel at this point kind of just sounds like having another “Paranormal Activity.”","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Netflix, Hulu and all the other streaming services, during the month of October I would scroll through all the cable channels to find a new horror film. The two that stood out most, and that were constantly played, were “A Nightmare On Elm Street” and “Halloween.” Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers are two of the most timeless classic horror villains, and both have had iconic original films that impacted audiences around the world and left imprints in the nightmares of both children and adults. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another common element among these films is that they both seem to have taken on exhaustingly long quests by creating an abundance of sequels which, oftentimes, did not land as well as the original. Now another trend has risen where films premier during the Halloween season hoping to become blockbusters. While the numbers in attendance may be flattering, most fail to become cult classics. I write this critique in a tentative manner after watching the latest installment of the “Halloween”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series, which, although not perfect, was undoubtedly a fun, nostalgia-filled, slasher film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween” having yet another sequel at this point kind of just sounds like having another “Paranormal Activity.” Nevertheless, hearing that wretched opening music, combined with the word “Halloween” in dripping, bright orange letters brought out a childlike reaction that had me wanting more. The “Halloween” series built itself by delivering murder scenes fueled with cynicism and other elements that are the quintessence of horror filmmaking. On the surface, Michael Myers can be seen as the average person, a slow-paced walking man wearing a mask. But it’s these details, combined with the idea that he is basically immortal (based on the many times he’s either shot in the face or burned alive), that make Myers, or the notion of him, an uncomfortable, deep-seated fear in the hearts of many. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween” sticks to its guns and hovers through some of the original filmmaking tactics and classic murder sequences honed throughout the series. It’s the deadly nighttime appearances by Michael Myers and the lack of a purpose behind his rampant killing spree as he sticks his legendary chef’s knife through a random woman’s throat that keeps the audience jumping in their seats. What pushed horror films like “Halloween” out of the mainstream was the use of enhanced technology and horrific costume designs combined with the too many jump scares. This new “Halloween” undoubtedly shows director David Gordon Green’s appreciation for old-school cinematography and screenwriting. The fact that Green has chosen to stray from integrating more modern takes on horror into this new “Halloween” film is indeed ambitious, but it can also create quite a few setbacks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dialogue in some of the scenes of this movie are incredibly cringeworthy. Awkward pauses and panel switches feel somewhat outdated, which can be a result of Green’s choice to keep the film’s aesthetic much like the original’s. While watching “Halloween,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I could not help but dwell on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cliché</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> plot holes about a lame high school dance and teenage romance, which are made out to be at the forefront of the film. This is all too common in slasher films — we get a variety of disposable characters and multiple plotlines that cut into the runtime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best parts about this rendition, if not</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best, is the return of Jamie Lee Curtis and her portrayal of  Laurie Strode. Oct. 26 marks the 40-year anniversary since the initial release of the original “Halloween” film, and she has not aged a bit. We are brought into Strode’s present life after being haunted by the traumatic experiences from her past with Myers, and she is rightfully transformed into a deadly assassin looking for vengeance. While it seems like her granddaughter (Andi Matichak) is supposed to be at the forefront of the film, Curtis steals the show.

However, it was entertaining and fun to have the new generation understand, at least somewhat, the importance of a character such as Michael Myers during the Halloween season. “Halloween”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is meant to be a simple film, with no complex plot that requires an in-depth analysis. The hardest thing to figure out, though … is Michael Myers actually dead this time?</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/halloween-in-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/halloween-in-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/halloween-in-review/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/halloween-in-review/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/halloween-in-review/","id":5759,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[5758,5757,5756],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Artsweek Reviews ‘Sorry to Bother You’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-08-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sorry-to-bother-lead.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sorry-to-bother-lead.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The film itself is anything but stuffy pompous filmmaking –– it breathes with a cartoonish elegance that triggers relieving enthusiasm. “Sorry To Bother You” mimiks the message which its prede...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head down, sleeping in a garage, living paycheck to paycheck: each of these are common narratives in both modern films and television shows. This is also the lifestyle of Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield) in the satirical film “Sorry To Bother You.” “Sorry To Bother You”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">carries twisted humor through a storyline chronicling sequences that are strange yet familiar in some of the most demented of ways. Director Boots Riley encapsulates his morbid curiosity to capture some of the darkest realities in a playful world of surreal landscapes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Stick to the script” are the four words that Cassius is overwhelmingly commanded to live by in order to best find success in his new telemarketing job for the company Regal View. Those four words are also what lead Cassius to relocate his focuses on gathering material possessions and living a lifestyle that does not comply with the desires of those who have been placed in similar situations through the hierarchy in his environment. In doing so, he learns to evolve his tone into what the film refers to as his “white-voice” and does not shy away from the truth in the matter. Riley also uses this to point toward the capitalistic nature found in companies throughout our nation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film itself is anything but stuffy pompous filmmaking –– it breathes with a cartoonish elegance that triggers relieving enthusiasm. “Sorry To Bother You” mimiks the message which its predecessor “Get Out” sets out to evoke within audiences. Riley takes some of the thematic elements which “Get Out” used, and implements them in order to drive the narrative. But, he models the film in a more intense and overwhelming way. For instance, Steve Lift (Armie Hammer), is much like Dean Armitage (aka, crazy dad in “Get Out”), in the sense that both have a similar desire to make use of black males bodies in order to fulfill twisted fantasies. However, Riley takes a quirkier approach and takes a more absurd route in employing a plot twist that creates a bifurcated world, landing the film a spot in the science fiction realm.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

In the aforementioned “Get Out,” he plays a character who is under a demented mind state inflicted by the “sunken place.” In the television show “Atlanta,” created by Donald Glover, Stanfield’s character Darius is constantly spitting words of wisdom and plays his role so effortlessly –– it is clear that Stanfield has proved himself perfect for his latest role. Cassius is conflicted and roams through the movie in revelatory form. His facial expressions are priceless. Stanfield intensifies the physical elements that go into the acting in this film. Throughout the movie so many of the sequences are cartoonish, watching Stanfield fool around in a geekish way completes the films aesthetic. It’s like watching “The Flintstones” and Cassius is Fred Flintstone, scoundering clumsily through everyday life in hopes to just make it to see another morning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His counterpart, Detroit (Tessa Thompson), walks around clad in flashy homemade earrings with an Afropunk aesthetic in each one of her outfits. In everything she does, Detroit embodies a bright and artistic demeanor. She even stunts a splendid tee shirt that says “Female Ejaculation Is The Future.” Seeing the way Armie Hammer’s character, Steve Lift, makes a nonsensical agreement with Cassius makes me think to myself, “This is probably what one of those secret conversations between Donald Trump and Kanye West would sound like.” But, I digress. Hammer’s demented portrayal combined with Stanfield’s lithe presence make an engaging sequence in the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sorry To Bother You” displays a socially stirring subject matter that aims to send out an important message. In doing this, the film also includes wonderful characters and startling plot loops. Riley’s ability to share a perspective on the world in such a comedic manner with a compelling storyline lands him a wonderful directorial debut. The humor is crude but also, many times, accurate. Quite frankly, if you are offended, you may either be racist or very unaware. Sure, the last 15 minutes of the film are chaotic and slightly rushed, but that is overpowered by what the rest of the film has to offer: a reminder that one person’s fiction may very well be another person’s real life horror story.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

abundance of glimmering lights and filled by a majority of middle-aged fans, the Santa Barbara Bowl was blessed with an outrageously effervescent performance by LCD Soundsystem. Despite likely having outgrown the post-punk sound that influenced the early releases of LCD Soundsystem’s music, those in attendance did not fail to immerse themselves in the show.</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, the legendary, genre-bending group made a stop at the SB Bowl to put on a life-altering performance. LCD Soundsystem proved to continue maintaining a legacy which has earned itself a victory lap once it comes to a gut-wrenching end.</p>\n<p>Prior to LCD Soundsystem gracing the stage, electronic duo Poolside kept the rhythm up for the few in attendance during the event’s beginning moments. A large disco ball hovered graciously above the stage, which suited the performance — Poolside labels their music as “Daytime Disco.” But as the sun began to set and the clock on the edge of the stage ticked, the audience became more and more anxious for LCD Soundsystem’s appearance. The groovy ballads could not contain the excitement lingering through everyone waiting.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lights dimmed and frontman James Murphy approached the mic, accompanied by his seven bandmates, and thus, the mayhem commenced. As he stood there intensely, clad in messy scruff, unkempt hair, suit jacket and all, bodies swarmed and Murphy prepared to make the stadium his playhouse.</p>\n<p>The band prepped the audience with an opening performance of “Yr City’s A Sucker,” a song which on the surface could pass as a track that is too downtempo to be an opener. LCD Soundsystem proved otherwise. And they continued to do so with each song, progressively captivating those in attendance more and more.</p>\n<p>“Get your drinks from the beer garden and get the hell over here!” Murphy yelled at the crowd testing them as if to see whether or not they were up to the challenge.</p>\n<p>Throughout the show, each song was more enticing than the last. The grandeur of their discography is remarkable as is, yet they managed to elevate each song to completely new levels by putting on phenomenal live rhythms. With a career that has endured since 2002, the years can reflect in one of two ways: the time can take a toll or their experience makes their performance even more efficient. Luckily, the latter seems to be the case. Murphy is relentless in his delivery, and with the support of immaculate instrumentals, his voice is carried swiftly through crowds. The impact of his vocals vibrated the audience and the slick guitar riffs intertwined with jam-packed drums to induce a head-bobbing atmosphere which resonated throughout the venue.</p>\n<p>The presentation of LCD Soundsystem’s live display was mesmerizing. With each thump from the drums and each wave from the synth, a different colored light shot from the massive hovering disco ball out into the crowd and all over the trees. The backdrop was dreamlike, switching from a sheet of red to galactic patterns, both outlining Murphy’s silhouette perfectly. Coupled with ultra-danceable instrumentation, the beams of light created a fascinating atmosphere, overlaying the crowd’s lively, spirited fist pumps.</p>\n<p>Up until a brief pause between two of their songs, nothing interrupted their elegant transition from track to track. This break was only made in order for Murphy to inform the crowd that the band would stop for a bathroom break very soon. “Don’t worry we’ll come back,” he said. “No need for all the encore chants.”</p>\n<p>Aside from this, the only other time that their seamlessly pinpointed performance paused was for Murphy to announce the rest of the members’ names. He went through in an orderly fashion, naming off Tyler Pope, Pat Mahoney, Nancy Whang, Korey Richey, Matt Thornley, Gavin Rayna Russom and Al Doyle.</p>\n<p>Shiny lights glistened as Murphy’s powerful voice sorrowfully begged in deep cut “I Can Change” off of <em>This Is Happening.</em> The crowd burst as Murphy bellowed, “We won’t be your babies anymore / We won’t be your babies ’til you take us home” during “You Wanted A Hit,” and they welcomed electrifying guitar riffs. In these moments, I could not help but realize how overlooked Murphy’s vocals are.</p>\n<p>LCD Soundsystem played a number of songs, flipping through the plethora of hits which they have created. The band tapped into some of the new contemporary highlights from their catalog such as “I Used To” and “Tonite” from <em>American Dream</em>, in which Murphy’s voice continued to pierce through the bodies that stood in amazement. “Get Innocuous!” from <em>Sound Of Silver </em>was a standout moment. The live interpretation of this song was enthralling as Whang chanted, “You can normalize. Don’t it make you feel alive?” and lights flashed on and off. When the stadium turned black for almost a split second, one could feel the intensity of the crowd’s desire for more.</p>\n<p>By the end of the night, LCD Soundsystem had proven that my expectations paled in comparison to what was to come. A wonderful setting with incredible music was the perfect combination. At the SB Bowl, the stakes weren’t high for an audience filled with fans, but Murphy remained consistent and demonstrated the mastery which deems LCD Soundsystem as a legendary band — proving that they can probably do this forever.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As for someone such as Jane Gottlieb,  a simple photograph will not suffice, seeing as she takes further steps in order to intensify the result. On Thursday evening, April 26, the walls of the AD&amp;A Museum at UCSB were wrapped in some of the glorious works crafted by the hands of Gottlieb as she stood amongst peers, family and students in preparation to give her lecture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the discussion many questions arose from those in attendance seeing as her work sparks much curiosity. Unlike many photographs, Gottlieb’s exemplifies some of the complexities of photo taking. Her art is saturated with illuminating colors which pop at first glance. The eccentricity of such radiant elements serve to be symbolic of the emotions which surge through the moments which she captures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fusion of colors which represent deep sentiments, Gottlieb pushes to draw more attention to them. Gottlieb further explained how one of her pieces is a manifestation of these concepts. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artist said to the crowd, “This is me trying to recreate the energy which you get when looking down from the Eiffel Tower, which isn’t there, positive energy really.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such an idea can come across as being very unusual but Gottlieb does well in proving through her work how the intricacy of adding her unique modifications polish the vision which she has.

She shared how for a long period of time she was originally interested in painting and then her passion strayed more towards photography. Her roots in painting are what elicited some of the first pieces Gottlieb created where she would use retouching dye on top of actual printed pieces.

dream and put something into my voice notes for later.” She shared how her creativity sparks in the some of the most profound areas like while she is “in water” taking a bath or “in the air” on plane rides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of these scenarios, that not only work to symbolize the way her music tends to make listeners feel, serve to show how her life has changed from once living in a car at the age of 17 to now the glowing lavishness which is at the forefront of her lifestyle. Uchis has released her highly anticipated full-length project titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and on it she takes on the task of establishing her versatility and ability to embed a variety of sounds into one album.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uchis carries a nimble, soft spoken persona, but what she does not say in interviews resonates loudly through her music. On </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s opening track, “Body Language (Intro),” she explores the intimacy of a tropical jazz, invoking the daydream state which lingers through a day on the beach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uchis’ lush voice pierces through the sensuality of the opener as she urges listeners to minimize the distance, singing “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just come closer, closer, closer, closer, closer/(</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanna know who you are</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)” and so, she invites us to explore the emotions which she has kept in confinement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What separates Uchis’ unique sound is the way she embraces her Colombian roots in a majority of her songs. This is prevalent in singles off the album such as “Nuestro Planeta” or “Tyrant,” in which artist like Reykon and Jorja Smith accompany Uchis over poppy rhythms that are reminiscent of reggaeton, which serve as backdrops to the dance music. Not only does she shine a light in a way which raises her cultural awareness but Uchis uses </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">almost as a soundtrack which excels in unveiling the scenes of her life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With “Miami,” Uchis  taps into the April March sound which is evocative of her appreciation for Quentin Tarantino’s Western induced sounds and she meshes it with synth-speckled instrumentals. Uchis’ magnificent storytelling gives one a glance into her movielike lifestyle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In My Dreams” sounds like the kind of quirky song cued to play at a dance in the ’80s. The low-tempo romance serenade, “Flight 22,” could play at the eye-to-eye, love at first glance moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bona fide collaborations on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make for indubitably stellar alliances. “Just A Stranger” is the type of combination which takes two profuse vocalists and makes for a rich, funky track. Steve Lacy compliments Uchis in a perfect way as the two sing the money over love ballad and is a standout production by BROCKHAMPTON’S Romil. “Tomorrow” channels the R&amp;B psychedelia which Uchis’ is fondly known for and Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker is magnificent at the control panel guiding the singer through the toxic swirl which is his production. Although titled</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Isolation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Uchis does well in reaching out for direction from immaculate contributors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the number of partnerships made throughout the album they only serve to showcase Uchis’. Uchis is empowering on her lonesome and swiftly glides through the clear waves of instrumentation which she rides eloquently. “Your Teeth In My Neck” exemplifies Uchis’ ability to utilize up-tempo orchestration. On “Feel Like A Fool” she demonstrates a vintage sound which triggers nostalgia to the doo-wop sound which could sneak its way into compilation of Motown classics. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">captures Kali Uchis’ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relentless ability to venture into an amalgamation of different musical domains. With Uchis, it is difficult to pinpoint with what sound she finds the most success. Nonetheless, it is not an overbearing element on her behalf, but rather, it showcases her talents. Similar to a film soundtrack, this project gathers a variety of songs which can be implemented for an abundance of feelings. There is no one single type of sound, yet the cohesiveness remains intricate. For whatever situation that comes in Uchis’ path, this protagonist proves to be at the center of the spotlight in each moment.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/in-review-isolation-by-kali-uchis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/in-review-isolation-by-kali-uchis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/in-review-isolation-by-kali-uchis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/in-review-isolation-by-kali-uchis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/in-review-isolation-by-kali-uchis/","id":6637,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6636,6635,6634],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Wes Anderson Embraces His Eccentricity in ‘Isle of Dogs’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-02-05-at-2-45-42-pm.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-02-05-at-2-45-42-pm.png?resize=780%2C439&ssl=1","description":"“Isle of Dogs,” serves as a reflection of Anderson’s inquisitive perspective of the world.

Anderson takes the dark concept of a dog-vacant society and blends it together with a venturesome endeavour made up of five furry companions who come to the aid of a 12-year-old boy, Atari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interestingly enough, when you say “Isle of Dogs” quickly, it comes out as “I love dogs” and Anderson does well in guiding us through the canine-passionate voyage. The four-legged mutts, which typically hold background roles, are at the forefront of this cinematic extravaganza. Among it’s opening sequences, the film introduces a community which has just banished dogs to a trash-filled island.

With cartoonish and rapid fight sequences and silky cinematography for the canine romance between Chief and Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson)  captures the essence of filmmaking in unorthodox and fun ways. The combination of Japanese culture woven together with Anderson’s compositional aesthetic make for grand moments which are pretty to the eye. His cinematography is best known for the meticulously chosen imagery and quirky shots which are used frequently throughout this film.  His irreplicable use of stop motion and styles are so smoothly inserted throughout “Isle of Dogs” which are what make the film unique</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isle of Dogs” makes for a joyous adventure. The beauty of a film like this, as with most Wes Anderson films, is its ability to encapsulate a variety of emotions meshed with societal concepts which raise awareness in a multitude of ways. The simple idea of helping an outcast group merge together with society is the movie’s main premise –– and has always been a prevalent topic in the societal climate of most eras throughout history. Throughout, Anderson exemplifies how to infuse such discussions in a not too overwhelming manner, which does not tarnish the atmosphere that he develops with the remaining entirety of the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atari is a character whom is somewhat naive but is also just a kid. And as any other kid, he is curious about the world. Anderson uses his power to test the limitations which restrict the young mind. Thinking about the childhood, playground moments where I stood on top of the highest platform of the jungle gym and pretended to take off on a rocket ship are brought to life by Anderson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously, dogs don’t actually speak English (although Anderson does his best in translating barks), which is what makes the film so fun and sets it apart from other “man’s best friend” flicks. Hearing the voices of big time actors and actresses such as Murray and Johansson was incredibly amusing, and the idea in and of itself sounds entertaining. Nevertheless, as pets which become close to humans, these animals have such beautiful ways of communicating to the world. The plot emphasizes the four-legged playmates’ capabilities to make a connection with humans. The relatability of these elements are what render viewers vulnerable to the emotion-evoking moments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isle of Dogs,” serves as a reflection of Anderson’s inquisitive perspective of the world. The simplicity of the ideas which linger throughout his mind are brought to light on the big screen and in the funnest of ways. Anderson does not hesitate with the creation of his plots and as long as this remains the case, he will keep audiences howling with joy.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

BADBADNOTGOOD on their latest project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IV</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to have Charlotte Day Wilson’s spectacular vocals implemented on “In Your Eyes,” a track in which the singer gleams and steals much of the sonic spotlight. This is where I first discovered the Toronto-based singer. After having delivered a delightful debut EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CDW, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson is back to welcome listeners into her vulnerable world of romanticism and empowerment. Titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone Woman, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her subsequent EP consists of six lovely ballads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project opens with the single “Stone Woman,” a bare minimalistic track. Although quite simple, the song serves to foreshadow the tone of the works that proceed it. The EP’s title track concludes with a pleasant transition into “Doubt,” where Wilson profoundly rides the slow-paced acoustics, sincerely admitting, “What have I done for your love?” In the second portion, Wilson promptly enters into liberating bellows over fast-paced drums and ends on a strong note. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson’s voice is gentle, almost sounding too fragile. At moments, one may start to doubt her ability to break into high-pitched vocals. Nevertheless, she exceeds expectations. Sounding so nimble at one moment and ascending into emotional breakthroughs the next, Wilson proves that she is merely tapping into a prowess which many vocalists train tirelessly to maintain. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson does well in illuminating the spectrum of R&amp;B with neo-soul instrumentals that work as backdrops to her booming vocals. On “Nothing New,” she employs an electronically-induced beat which resonates throughout the background of the track. At the peak of the synths one can hear a faint shriek that sounds almost effortless and comes down to a mellow fadeaway.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The singer moves eloquently through versatile musicality and takes an avant-garde approach to the varying melodies. Following “Nothing New,” producer River Tiber grabs hold of Wilson and leads her into a darker tone for the soulful “Let You Down.” The jazzy drum beats are similar to sounds from BADBADNOTGOOD, which does not come as a surprise considering the artists’ collaborative history. River Tiber, who’s discography also consists of tracks with artists such as KAYTRANADA and Daniel Caesar, provides an incredible space where Wilson finds much success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Falling Apart,” Tiber returns to provide an eerie instrumental as a silhouette to Wilson. She sings, “Falling deeper and I’m never coming home/Never coming home, no,” dropping into the atmospheric area which is Tiber’s intoxicating production. Ending with “Funeral,” a melancholic anthem, Wilson invites listeners to discover some of the dark thoughts that frame her mentality and brings the task full circle with jazzy saxophone and trumpets that outline the bridge of the song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast to her debut EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CDW, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson proves to have a stronger grasp of structuring her instrumentals. The concept behind the EP’s title, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone Woman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, could be interpreted as a play on words: Wilson has gained some stability as a musician and maybe just as a human being as she has searched for validation and for someone who cares.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone Woman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Wilson takes listeners through a path filled with discovery of self-worth and desire to fulfill impulses for love. Many artists thrive in their storytelling abilities. With Wilson, listeners do not receive too many of the specific details or really much of a narrative, yet her lyricism does well in evoking different facets of emotion. It is evident in the way she shares her feelings that she’s lost someone who once filled the gap which still remains. There is no doubt that with Wilson’s talent, she has the star potential, but where the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone Woman </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decides to go remains entirely in her control. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81834\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/friday-review-stone-woman-by-charlotte-day-wilson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81834\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/friday-review-stone-woman-by-charlotte-day-wilson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/friday-review-stone-woman-by-charlotte-day-wilson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/friday-review-stone-woman-by-charlotte-day-wilson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/friday-review-stone-woman-by-charlotte-day-wilson/","id":6653,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6652,6651,6650],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: Crush by Ravyn Lenae","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ravyn-lenae.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ravyn-lenae.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In Crush, Steve Lacy and Ravyn Lenae travel together through lingering compositions, unraveling one another’s potential as musicians.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<p>In a music world filled with young, braggadocious rappers pushing many of the same beats time and time again, it is rare to find a creative duo as young as Ravyn Lenae and Steve Lacy. Nevertheless, the two 19-year-olds have collaborated and delivered the five-track EP, <em>Crush. </em>On <em>Crush, </em>Lenae and Lacy, on the cusp of adulthood, come together to deliver an unorthodox yet soulful EP filled with a desire to remember past lovers and to feel wanted.</p>\n<p>Despite being young, the phenomenal duo have each had their fair share of experiences in the music industry. Lacy, a star from the band The Internet has ingrained his funky, tight beats into the ears of Kendrick Lamar listeners with his production on the inimitable track, “LUST” from Lamar’s <em>DAMN</em>. When he is not busy making beats on his iPhone, Lacy can also be heard accompanying artists such as Tyler, The Creator or Goldink, laying out some passionate vocals on songs like “911/Mr. Lonely” or “Some Girl.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lenae has released two EPs prior to <em>Crush</em>. On each she takes similar approaches to some funky instrumentals as she does on her project with Lacy. Her dreamy voice shines on her collaboration with Mick Jenkins, the bouncy, club-like banger “Communicate.” Lenae has also made appearances on albums like <em>blkswn</em> by Smino and <em>Telefone</em> by Noname in which she complements her peers to create passionate lyricism. But each of these seem to pale in comparison to the alliance which is Lenae and Lacy.</p>\n<p>Lenae’s voice is versatile as we receive what sounds like an attempt to escape the boundaries of her own vocal capacities. Her shrill singing on the EP single and opening track, “Sticky,” is reminiscent of the way Frank Ocean experiments with high pitched vocals on songs like “Ivy” or “Pretty Sweet” off of <em>Blonde</em>. Nonetheless, this is where Lenae finds power in testing the limitation of her vocal prowess. She gives Erykah Badu-esque vocals as she induces a dreamlike environment for her listeners when singing, “Slipping ‘til you let me drown; Hate me then you love me now.”</p>\n<p>Not a single moment does Lacy allow us to forget about his psychedelic guitar. On “Closer (Ode 2 U)” the groovy producer makes his presence known through consistently sexy instrumentation. Toward the back end of the track, the lush bass transcends Lenae into a falsetto over Lacy’s faint voice singing “Baby pull me closer, you should let me love you.” With “Computer Luv,” Lacy proves that he can provide a backdrop for Lenae with not only decorative guitar patterns but also through vocal elements as he accompanies her on the song’s hook.</p>\n<p>But really, where the two stand out is with their ability to make use of simplistic instrumentals. This is where Lacy finds success most: in his combination of seemingly effortless but unique guitar chords and synths. Like in his aforementioned standout production on Kendrick Lamar’s “LUST,” Lacy gives a repetitive, unconventional guitar riff on “4 Leaf Clover.” However, this is arguably the standout track of the five-song project. The R&amp;B singers bounce off of one another in synchronization to create a pretty, elegant blend. The duet combines to share their fear of commitment, uncertainty and taking the next step in a relationship.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, <em>Crush</em> is a modern take on old school R&amp;B. Each song is perfect for laying back, plugging in your headphones and lighting a candle to embrace the sensuality that Lenae and Lacy provide. It is clear that the young duo rely heavily on their predecessors. In <em>Crush</em>, Lacy and Lenae travel together through lingering compositions, unraveling one another’s potential as musicians. When asked about his opinion on the collaboration, Lacy looked at it as his “Pharrell/Kelis” or “Timbaland/Aaliyah” moment. Although the two have not quite reached such a level, the young virtuosos have created a more than exceptional collection of sensational, romantic ballads.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81536\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81536\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/","id":6646,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6645,6644,6643],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"María del Pilar Shares Truth in Song at MCC","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Maria-Del-Pilar-5-17-3-e1463528105807.jpg?resize=350%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Maria-Del-Pilar-5-17-3-e1463528105807.jpg?resize=350%2C525&ssl=1","description":"“Tu y yo bailamos, con mucho vigor.” The words rolled off smoothly as del Pilar strummed the strings of her ukulele.

Throughout del Pilar’s performance it was clear that embracing who she is a motto that she lives by.</p>\n<p>Just about every seat in the building was taken and the crowd was filled with a variety of people. It was a fusion of cultures; the conversations that went on in the venue were in several different languages. People were anxious and a few minutes had already passed by after the scheduled start time. Despite the slight delay, the performer did not waste any time in delivering her eclectic sounds. Immediately after taking the stage, del Pilar took control and made the building a place full of energy. Her first song was intense. The way she sang was so passionate that it caught the crowd off guard.</p>\n<p>“<em>Tu y yo bailamos, con mucho vigor</em> (You and I dance vigorously).” the intimate words rolled off of her tongue smoothly as she strummed the strings of her ukulele. The passion from her high-pitched vocals resonated throughout the room. Del Pilar’s fluorescent vocals were also accompanied by some amazing electric guitar accompaniment. The guitarist’s solos were intricate and very well done. The riffs vibrated throughout the room and created a powerful and alternative aesthetic. All the sounds going on meshed together perfectly and created a pretty and melodic vibe within the small venue.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After just about each one of the songs she performed, del Pilar shared some insight about her life with the crowd. She spoke about the bicultural influence that has inspired her to bring about this English and Spanish blend.</p>\n<p>“I started off with a band called ‘Los Abandoned,’” del Pilar shared. “We started somewhat of a Spanglish scene in Los Angeles. I just thought I should share with you all some of my back story since you may be wondering why I am dressed the way I am.”</p>\n<p>Del Pilar, embracing her roots, danced on stage wearing high-waisted pants and a large flower around her neck. Her energy rubbed off on the audience, and people were either standing and dancing — which del Pilar highly encouraged — or bobbing their heads and tapping their feet. It was evident that the artist has a rebellious soul and that all she wants is to have fun doing what she loves most: sharing her art with others and empowering those who face similar circumstances as hers. She spoke about the obstacles that her father had to overcome in order to provide her with a good life. Her father’s will to strive is what fueled her ambitions to be not only a musical artist but also a role model to others.</p>\n<p>“I am still going to do my thing despite anything that comes my way,” del Pilar exclaimed as she began her final song of the night.</p>\n<p>The singer finished off her setlist with her song “Quien Eres.”</p>\n<p>“This song is about not being afraid of who you are,” she stated. It was [[a]] night of Chilean alternative pop with a hint of young angst. Once the event was over just about everyone in attendance stood in line and waited to pick up a copy of del Pilar’s album <em>Songs+Canciones I</em>. I made sure not to leave without grabbing one for myself.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

neck as he announced, “I’m just trying to get vibey.” The young man was DJ/producer Matt DiMona, the opening performer for Goldroom at the Hub. It was April 7, a Thursday night, and the venue was nowhere near its capacity. Nevertheless, DiMona proceeded to play his remix of Blackbear’s “90210.” There was a wave of head bobbing as the song played and the pace stayed moderate as he went on to play his song “I Just Want You.” After giving the crowd a taste of his own music, DiMona filled the venue with some nostalgic vibes as he played “Bartender” by T-Pain. Everyone sang along as the soulful jam boomed from the loudspeakers.</p>\n<p>After the R&amp;B hit was over, it was clear that everyone was ready for more. At this point what was once a room filled with a few heads bobbing back and forth was now one with the nightclub aesthetic. A slight pause went by, and the words “Your love is fadin’” filled the room as the song “Fade” by Kanye West came on. The audience rocked back and forth with intensity as the funky vibrations shook the room. Not only was DiMona able to make great use of one of West’s newest songs, but he also managed to resurrect the sensational music of R&amp;B artist Frank Ocean as he played his song “Lost.” The crowd yelled in agreement with the DiMona as he questioned “Yo, when is Frank Ocean going to drop that album though?!”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69887\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69887\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1782381608\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69978\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69887\" data-attachment-id=\"69887\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/goldroom-by-jenny-luo-online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=350%2C233&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,233\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom by Jenny Luo 4-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69887\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As DiMona made subtle transitions between electronic and rock music — ranging from from Blood Orange to music with a much more house-like feel — the energy levels only became higher and more intense. It was clear that DiMona was feeling the liveliness of the crowd, seeing as he was jumping up and down and encouraging those around him to join him. Just as the crowd thought he was finished, the DJ yelled, “Yo, you guys down to listen to a song I’ve never performed before?” Of course, the audience yelled in excitement as his never before heard tune came on.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was a bittersweet ending to an amazing set list, but the night was not over at the Hub. Goldroom had yet to reach the stage but everyone continued dancing, keeping the upbeat mood alive. The tone was set in stone as the Goldroom crew proceeded to set up their variety of instruments.</p>\n<p>There was a unique array of sounds infused throughout the venue as the six-person group began their set for the night. The musicians began the night by performing their song “Only You Can Show Me,” and as the audience engaged themselves in the sensational sounds that the tropical band had to offer, it was clear that the Gauchos were digging the music.</p>\n<p>“Her voice is crazy!” yelled one of the audience members in reference to the female vocalist. For a brief moment the singer stood in the middle of the stage, and as she sang “Till Sunrise” the melodious lyrics pierced through the crowd and echoed throughout the venue. Josh Legg, the mastermind behind the production and lyrics of the music Goldroom has to offer, has stated that he enjoys switching up the musicians for his live performances. It makes for a unique show with unpredictable outcomes seeing as everyone is artistic and skilled in their own way.</p>\n<p>Along with the beautiful vocals that Goldroom provided came the energetic instrumentals. From the drums, guitar, bass, keyboard and even the chimes, every instrument played a crucial role in the live performance. It was dance music with a serene and passionate feeling throughout the crowd. Although it was a bit awkward when Legg announced, “Find somebody to make out with,” as the song “Fifteen” came on, there was a sense of relief when Goldroom played what was deemed to be a new song called “Breaks.”</p>\n<p>“This song can be a break from anything, really.” Legg said, and it was just that: a break from reality.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, you guys are beautiful!” said Legg as he and the rest of the group made their way off the stage. However, that was not enough for the Gauchos on that Thursday night; they fiended for more, and as they yelled, “Encore!” over and over again, Goldroom came back to the stage to perform one last song for the deserving audience. In an interview a few days prior to the concert, Legg stated that a good crowd for him is one that is not “cool” but is willing to embrace the music, dance and have fun. That night, the Hub’s audience, without a doubt, met his expectations.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_69888\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69888\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"185469295\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69978\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69888\" data-attachment-id=\"69888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/goldroom-by-jenny-luo-online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=400%2C267&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,267\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom by Jenny Luo 4-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69888\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Goldroom is particularly unique from other DJs because his career began when he was part of the band NightWaves. Since then, Legg has taken on the pseudonym Goldroom and found much success by providing his fans with amazing and relaxing sounds.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based artist sticks close to his roots, as his name stems from the city itself. Legg sees LA as one big gold room, and this is what influenced him to choose the nom de plume. Legg’s first few songs, “City Girls” and “Morgan’s Bay,” were heavily influenced by LA and in a way were odes to the beautiful city. Being an artist from such a big city is difficult because one is surrounded by hundreds of other young people with big dreams. Nevertheless, Legg found his way in the music industry and has brought along some friends. After working as a solo project for some time, Legg turned Goldroom into a trio when he was joined by keyboardist/vocalist Mereki Beach and drummer Nick Sandler.</p>\n<p>After transforming into a live three-member ensemble, Goldroom’s sound has evolved into a mixture of tropical and upbeat production accompanied by soothing and melodious vocals. Since 2013 his performances have evolved into live shows involving four members, adding in a bassist. Although his sound is categorized as dance music, Legg integrates instrumentation and vocals that lead to a much more passionate and ardent feeling than the work of typical EDM artists. His distinctive melody has paved the way for him as he has made notable appearances at some of the most prestigious music festivals and venues in the landscape; for example, he joined reputable artists such as Flume, Mac DeMarco and Toro Y Moi at last year’s FYF festival.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Goldroom is on his Pacific Coast Trip tour right now, performing in places ranging from Portland to Santa Barbara to Indio. Luckily, Josh Legg took some time from his busy schedule to answer some questions from the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Unlike some artists that get caught up in fame and materiality, it is clear that Legg has a genuine passion for what he does. Legg digs deep into his creative process and makes sure to keep his vibe unlike that of many other DJs.</p>\n<p>“I like to think of myself as a songwriter that happens to make dance music,” he stated when asked about the lyrics in his music.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that he produces his beats, Legg also holds the vocal component of his music near and dear to his heart.</p>\n<p>“Songwriting is the core,” says Legg. “The lyrics allow me to convey a message.” It is evident that he finds the connection between him and his listeners to be a vital aspect of his creative process.</p>\n<p>Legg sticks close to his roots and constantly finds himself going back to where he started: playing an acoustic guitar.</p>\n<p>“I was always playing acoustic guitar and writing songs. When I was younger I was always in band.” In fact, he also says that whenever he gets writer’s block what seems to help him gain some motivation is going straight to his acoustic guitar. Nevertheless, Legg urges others to “make a challenge for yourself.”</p>\n<p>His songwriting has definitely progressed since his first EP, and Legg shared that this is surely going to be noticeable in his upcoming debut album.</p>\n<p>“My songwriting has gone to a new level,” claims Legg.</p>\n<p>Not only have his songwriting abilities advanced, but he has also found himself embracing more performers in his live act. Throughout his entire career he has only had a six-piece group once, but he feels as if this helps in making his performance much more electrifying.</p>\n<p>“Performing live is normal for people who are performing other people’s songs,” states the songwriter. “This adds a unique flavor from other artists.”</p>\n<p>Rather than being close-minded, Legg believes that Goldroom is about trying new sounds and taking risks. “When I close my eyes, this is what I pictured Goldroom to be,” states Legg.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Santa Barbara will have the opportunity to experience the sensational and tropical vibes that Goldroom has to offer at The Hub on April 7. Doors will open at 8:30 p.m. and students can buy their ticket at the A.S. Ticket Office for $14 or $21 at the door.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/","id":6768,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6767,6766,6765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stephen’s Eclectic Sounds Take Over Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/53-atlg.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/53-atlg.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","description":"Few people watched as Tyson Leonard, the violinist and founder of the band Tropo, a man in a simple black T-shirt holding a violin, made his way onto the stage.

Although Tropo was originally a one-man band, Leonard was later accompanied by drummer Adam Kapuscinski and bassist Grant Leonard. Interestingly, their jazzy and classical rhythm is integrated with a lush synth, providing an electronic club atmosphere. As more people filled the room, a funkier and groovier tempo arose, causing the audience to start dancing, along with a soothing touch of vocals from Leonard, maintaining a relaxing rhythm. This portion of the show felt as if it was a Boiler Room session with Flume and Yo-Yo Ma. Despite the upbeat feel, Tropo lacked some of the interaction and performance expertise that was embodied by the subsequent performers.</p>\n<p>Upon gathering their various instruments, Tropo thanked Santa Barbara’s amazing crowd and made their way off stage. Throughout the intermission I overheard some conversations and managed to interact with a few of the audience members. Two young women told me their reasons for being at the show that night.</p>\n<p>“My friend and I were just looking for a place with good music and we came across this, we’ve never heard of any of these artists before,” stated one of the girls. Her friend then went on to explain, “We were just looking for good music, really, of any genre.” Although they were unfamiliar with the artists prior to the show, they both agreed that the music was surprisingly sensational.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lineup for the night was perfect for just that — anyone with an eclectic taste in music and a yearning for melodic jams.</p>\n<p>A skinny and tall young man approached the mic with high intensity. “Can we turn up? It’s fucking Saturday night!” yelled Lafa Taylor, the Oakland-based singer/emcee/producer. Throughout his career, Taylor has managed to find himself incorporating a variety of different genres into his music, leading to a unique artistic performance. Not only is the music that Lafa Taylor has to offer noteworthy, but he also has an impressive ability to engage the audience and leave them craving more. Taylor’s beats were so ardent that each time the bass dropped the venue shook and the crowd became invigorated and overcome by the music. “Y’all feel that shit!?” yelled the emcee. Although heavily influenced by trap, Taylor has managed to dig deep into the roots of R&amp;B and old-school hip hop, incorporating it into his setlist. People sang along as Ginuwine’s “Pony” came on and a nostalgic feeling emerged as Notorious B.I.G’s “Hypnotize” resonated through the loudspeakers, dispersing into the elated audience.</p>\n<p>Lafa Taylor’s “It’s all music” message pervaded his performance to emphasize that despite the wide genres of music exemplified, the ultimate goal was to play soulful music that would allow the audience to lose themselves in the music.</p>\n<p>After a long wait, Stephen finally took the stage, leading everyone to force their way even closer to him, ensuring a better view. Although Stephen gained much of his fanbase from the song “Bullet Train,” which he made back in 2013 while still in college. He has since transitioned into a somewhat new sound that has a much more genuine essence. Similar to a vast majority of other artists that create music without the intention to simply attain great wealth, Stephen has a relatively small fanbase. Every song was filled with a high level of intimacy due to all of Stephen’s music surprisingly being backed up by the singing of the crowd. Almost everyone in attendance sang the lyrics to every song he played, each time becoming more entranced with his words and the music. Nonetheless, this was not the only impressive element of Stephen’s performance, as he demonstrated his incredible knowledge of almost every instrument that surrounded him and as he not only sang, but also played the drums and guitar. “I’m gonna be real with you guys, that was probably the best I’ve ever played a guitar,” Stephen shared after he gave an astonishingly remarkable guitar solo. He went on to make it clear that he could, for a fact, play a rad drum solo — “Alright, before I leave I have to play the drums,” announced Stephen as he grabbed the drumsticks and had an intense drum-off with the original drummer. To finish off the show, Stephen performed a phenomenal live version of his cover of Adele’s “Hello.”</p>\n<p>The night was, in the words of Lafa Taylor himself, “A fusion of music, multiple styles mixed together!”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/stephens-eclectic-sounds-take-over-velvet-jones/","id":6799,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6798,6797,6796],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Room’ Leaves Viewers Heartbroken","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Room-png.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Room-png.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Like many of the other astounding independent films that debuted in 2015, “Room” failed to gain attention prior to its release.

Despite the setback, the movie has managed to gather the attention of audiences across the world.</p>\n<p>In the past, director Larry Abrahamson’s films have failed to gain said attention; nevertheless, the film, “Room,” continues to receive acclamation from critics. Abrahamson developed his film from Emma Donoghue’s novel, <em>Room</em>. When writing the film Donoghue was hesitant about the novel’s on-screen biopic, afraid that it would simply be “a really soppy movie or pervy, grim, voyeuristic one.” Nonetheless, the film was electrifying, leading fans to experience a whirlwind of emotions.</p>\n<p>The movie stars Brie Larson as “Ma” and Jacob Tremblay as Jack, both of which have been presented with prestigious awards for their spectacular performances in <em>Room</em>. As Jack — an easily impressed five-year-old boy — speaks in amazement during the opening scene, the audience is shown scenes of him running around in amusement confined to a 10-by-10-foot room. Their lifestyle is introduced as being filled with tiresome habits, which becomes evident in seeing that Jack and Ma never leave the condemned area. However, the tone of the film shifts as it reveals that both Ma and Jack have been placed in this room due to a horrific nightmare scenario, causing the audience to embark on a journey filled with despair. Although this may appear to be a vital part of the plot, it pales in comparison to what the rest of the film has to offer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While in captivation, the protagonists develop a schedule that leads a young and vulnerable Jack to believe that he is in a safe environment. His imagination engrosses him in a make-believe world that has made him oblivious to the fact that his mother is living a life filled with sorrow. Furthermore, Jack’s narrow-minded habits manage to make the audience frustrated as they see he is incapable of handling the horrific reality he lives in; and yet, it is up to him to save what is left of his mother’s life. Although the film consists of a rather depressing plot,</p>\n<p>Every scene is indispensable, essential for the next, constantly leaving the audience questioning what will follow. As the film progresses, the audience is forced to separate from a setting, which has constructed a relationship with the viewers. The room is not only a place, but rather a significant part in the lives of both Ma and Jack. Throughout the entire movie, it is referred to as “room,” personifying it as if it were a name with feelings and memories attached to it, rather than simply being a place. Regardless of the fact that the setting changes drastically, the mood only escalates to breathtaking scenes, showing that Ma is suffering a mental breakdown triggered by leading a life filled with vile experiences.</p>\n<p>It is always difficult to believe that what goes on in movies can even come close to being slightly real. “Room” unravels an all-too-realistic situation filled with dire conditions, leading the audience to empathize with those that have to endure a situation similar to the one Ma and Jack faced. Viewers are guaranteed to have an epiphany sparked by the realism that is painted by Abrahamson. Room itself may be small, but the imprint it leaves is enormous.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/","id":5899,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[5898,5897,5896],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/691"}},"__N_SSG":true}
