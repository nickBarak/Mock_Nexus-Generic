in recent years, resulting in a less devastating aftermath of pollution in the small, oceanside area. This year, an approximate 250 volunteers assembled at 11 a.m. to clean up I.V. — a considerably smaller group than the 349 volunteers in 2015 and 367 in 2014, but just as successful as in previous years.</p>\n<p>Most volunteers tend to be I.V. residents who want to keep their neighborhood clean, according to Adam Portè, Adopt-A-Block supervisor. “Unfortunately, a lot of the times the people that were partying here on Saturday night are gone by Sunday morning,” said Portè, who was pleased to see the work completed in two hours after posting pictures online of the 66 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69346\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69346\" data-attachment-id=\"69346\"

neighborhood after waking up in the morning.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of negative media coverage on that Deltopia event because of those riots and … when they came out of their houses that morning, they were just disgusted.” Portè said. “They saw my volunteers out there and they took it upon themselves to bring their own trash bags, their own brooms.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69351\"

Awards Dinner on Wednesday in Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>UCSB First was able to award grants to seven more campus organizations than last year. The five winners of $250 grants were Kappa Kappa Gamma, Greeks 4 Kids, Gamma Zeta Alpha, Dance Marathon and Swipe Out Hunger. The six winners of $500 grants were Queer Art Collective, Global Medical Brigades, Zeta Beta Tau, Street Health Outreach, Phi Delta Epsilon and Love Your Melon.</p>\n<p>Chris Pizzinat, deputy director of UCSB’s Office of Development, said those who participate in charity work should be honored for the example they set.</p>\n<p>“Philanthropy is not inherently ingrained in everyone, giving back is a largely learned value,” Pizzinat said. “It is emulated by those who feel an ownership of either an organization, a community or a cause. [These groups] are ones who teach these concepts to others through example. We are proud of what they are accomplishing and the impact of their work and we wish them much success.”</p>\n<p>According to Madison Frame, UCSB First co-chair and third-year psychology major, the campus organizations turned in applications describing their philanthropic work to be considered for the grant. Frame said UCSB First closely scrutinized applicant groups.</p>\n<p>“We chose the winners with the help of our committee, looking through all the applications and had a sort of rubric to help guide the committee members in evaluating how worthy the applicants were of receiving a grant,” Frame said. “The applications go through several checks with our advisors, with the committee and we even involved the Office of Student Life to ensure every component is accounted for.”</p>\n<p>Megan Jones, UCSB First co-chair and third-year communication and global studies double major, said UCSB First chose grant winners in part based on how they have expressed gratitude to donors in the past.</p>\n<p>“An interesting part of our rubric is based on the involvement the organization will have with the donors who gave these grants and are sponsoring in honor of their work,” Jones said. “It was something we really took into consideration because philanthropy gratitude is something we really emphasize.”</p>\n<p>Kelli Kaesberg, philanthropy chairperson of Kappa Kappa Gamma, said the sorority will most likely use the grant to plan a springtime philanthropy event for a charity that provides books for children in need.</p>\n<p>“We just had our fall and winter philanthropy events and since they were so successful, I think we’d be able to pull off a springtime philanthropy event where most of the proceeds would go to Reading is Fundamental,” Kaesberg said.</p>\n<p>Lynn Padlipsky, executive director of Dance Marathon and fourth-year biology major, said the grant will go toward next year’s Dance Marathon event.</p>\n<p>“The money we were given tonight will go to helping us start the planning for next year’s Dance Marathon event, where it will be bigger and better than this year’s,” Padlipsky said. “And all the money we raise then will go to Cottage Children’s Hospital.”</p>\n<p>Aimee Michelle, co-chair of Queer Art Collective and third-year CCS art and sociology double major, said she believes the organization was chosen for the grant due to its quickly growing presence on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think they chose us because we just started this organization this year,” Michelle said. “We already put on a $19,000 event and we’re already working with a lot of other groups even if we just started.”</p>\n<p>According to Xara Lopez, co-chair of Queer Art Collective, the money will be used to support queer students’ artistic expressions.</p>\n<p>“The money is going to go to supporting a lot of our new ventures,” Lopez said. “We specifically want to have spaces for queer students who express themselves artistically, so one of the main blocks we had was art supplies and those things cost a lot of money.”</p>\n<p>Caitie Mathias, president of Global Medical Brigades, said the organization will use its grant for medicine needed for its summer trip to Honduras.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to use this money to pay for medications to go to Honduras in the summer,” Mathias said.  “Medications cost a lot of money and we see about 1,200 patients while we’re there and it’s kind of scary when we’re close to running out of medications, so every bit counts.”</p>\n<p>Mathias said her organization “promotes self-sustainability” in the communities in which it works, which she believes is why it was chosen for a grant.</p>\n<p>“At the end of our clinic we have a public health lesson for all the people in the community,” Mathias said. “Adults have their own public lesson about nutrition, family-planning, STDs and then we have a health lesson for the children and we teach them about brushing their teeth and other health things. We’re there to make lasting changes.”</p>\n<p>Jennifer Linares, public relations manager for Love Your Melon, said the organization was surprised to receive a grant, being such a young organization.</p>\n<p>“We’re just starting off on campus and not a lot of people know about us,” Linares said. “We just started here in November but we’re not an official organization on campus until Spring Quarter, so getting the award feels really great that they acknowledged out work.”</p>\n<p>According to Fanzana Chapman, secretary for Love Your Melon, she believes the organization was selected because of the unique nature of its work providing hats for children with cancer.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the reasons why is we don’t hear very often [of] clubs that are supporting child cancer awareness,” Chapman said. “We do hear things like breast cancer or cancer awareness but for Love Your Melon, this will be the first club establishment here at UCSB. I think it’s something where you hear it’s unique and something that is here for the first time.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/","id":2518,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2517,2516,2515],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dance Marathon Raises Money for Children’s Hosptial","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students participated in a full 12 hours of dancing, games and activities to raise money for Cottage Children's Hospital in UCSB’s third annual Dance Marathon on Saturday from noon to midnight in Ro...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68504\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68504\" data-attachment-id=\"68504\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/dance-marathon-raises-money-for-childrens-hosptial/dance-marathon-attendees-are-guided-in-a-stretch-by-the-emcees/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon 2016\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68504\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Dance marathon attendees are guided in a stretch by the emcees.

Although they organize fundraisers year-round, the 12-hour Dance Marathon event is the organization’s largest and most well-known event. The annual fundraiser invites UCSB students to perform and seeks donations from participants and the community. This year’s event raised approximately $16,000, which was substantially less than last year’s total of $35,000.</p>\n<p>Sueleme Ceballos, Dance Marathon Director of Entertainment and fourth-year political science major, said the organization originally hoped this year’s event would exceed last year’s donations.</p>\n<p>“The goal this time was $50,000 — we were hoping that it got there,” Ceballos said. “We were hoping to get it up there, hopefully higher every year. We want to set a good precedent for our future Dance Marathons, because the event is still new to UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Despite not reaching its monetary goal, Dance Marathon maintained a positive outlook, Executive Director and fourth-year biology Lynn Padlipsky said.</p>\n<p>“I was extremely thrilled about how the morale stayed positive the entire time. Everyone danced the entire time, everyone was happy,” Padlipsky said. “Do I wish the numbers were higher? Yes. But that’s okay. The morale was high this year.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68466\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68466\" data-attachment-id=\"68466\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/dance-marathon-raises-money-for-childrens-hosptial/the-amount-raised/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon 2016\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68466\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=800%2C530\" alt=\"Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Sammy Gerraty Dance Marathon Intern of Operations and second-year dance and pre-bio double major, the spirit of the donors and volunteers made the event a success.</p>\n<p>“Even though we didn’t have as many dancers as last year and even though the numerical amount may not have been as much, the spirit in the room and the genuine care for the kids is what made people stay,” Gerraty said. “Last year people were coming to [get] volunteer hours, and that’s the wrong reason to come.

featuring Grammy-nominated NEEDTOBREATHE and Johnnyswim at the Granada Theater this weekend.</p>\n<p>KHK is run by Advanced Placement Economics students at San Marcos High School (SMHS). The organization aims to help children in need by raising money at fundraising events throughout Santa Barbara. The Benefit Gala Concert is their flagship annual event, and it has featured popular, award winning artists such as Andy Grammer and Sara Bareilles. This year, KHK also hosted a car raffle and a silent auction, raising a total of $460,000.</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Chloe Allen said though some KHK members worried the concert would not have a good turnout, the event was successful.</p>\n<p>“When we saw people slowly coming in, we were scared that we were going to have a lot of empty seats and the energy wouldn’t be that great,” Allen said. “But after Johnnyswim came on, they did a great job of setting the tone for the night and when NEEDTOBREATHE came on, everyone was so into it.”</p>\n<p>KHK Director of Outreach and SMHS senior Olivia Jones said the event “crushed” the organization’s fundraising goal of $350,000.</p>\n<p>“I can confidently say that I have never been so proud in my entire life with how the concert turned out,” Jones said in email. “We were able to raise $461,000 this year, and that is something not many high school seniors can or ever will say.”</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Allison Bliss said she was surprised to see such a diverse crowd at the concert.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67273\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67273\" data-attachment-id=\"67273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/nonprofit-hosts-concert-to-benefit-children-in-need/kidshelpingkidssb_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452284265\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kids Helping Kids SB\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67273\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x684.jpg?resize=500%2C334\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“There were so many different types of people in the crowd — people [from] different states even — and they all came together and their energy was amazing,” Bliss said. “I was personally in the crowd at the very end and everyone was just so hyped and happy to be there.”</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Emily Imperato said the event was successful due to KHK members’ hard work and cooperation.</p>\n<p>“The event went really well because so many people were working so hard backstage and through the entire thing and it executed perfectly,” Imperato said. “We got exactly what we were looking for, the stage looked great, the artists were great and so the hard work paid off.”</p>\n<p>Imperto said the silent auction on the second floor of the theater was “packed” with bidders.</p>\n<p>“It went really well and there were so many people bidding for so many items,” Imperato said. “All the items were donated to us, and every single bid — that money goes straight to kids locally and globally.”</p>\n<p>Granada Theater staff member Stephanie Staud said the event improved upon the previous year’s concert.</p>\n<p>“They were way better with their planning.

Santa Catalina South Hall Community Service Chair and first-year political science major Leanna Lugo organized Winter Warm-Up to help provide blankets for the shelter during this time.</p>\n<p>Lugo said the shelter has a shortage of blankets for the estimated 100 individuals expected to arrive at the shelter in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“They suggested I host a blanket drive,” Lugo said. “I went to my advisor and talked to him about it and he said it is a great idea so I began planning it.”</p>\n<p>According to Lugo, the program was a “success” and has received 40 to 50 blankets so far.</p>\n<p>“What I’m hoping for by the end of this week is about 60 blankets, but right now I think we have a pretty good amount,” Lugo said.</p>\n<p>Lugo said she originally wanted to organize volunteering for the shelter.</p>\n<p>“I really wanted to take a group of students to help feed the homeless at Casa Esperanza because I really liked what the shelter stood for and their mission,” Lugo said. “But when I got into contact with them, they were busy because it was November. They were booked for volunteers.”</p>\n<p>Lugo said most donations came in after students returned from the Thanksgiving weekend.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think people had a lot of used blankets here but when they went home for Thanksgiving break, they seemed to have brought back a lot since then,” Lugo said. “On Monday I started to see a lot of blankets in the boxes. Some people even brought clothes.”</p>\n<p>Santa Catalina South Hall Multimedia Coordinator and first-year communication major Carmen Ma said the values associated with Thanksgiving may have prompted students to donate blankets.</p>\n<p>“People start to remember what they’re thankful for and they start wanting to give back because they realize all that they have.” Ma said.</p>\n<p>Ma said it was easy to get students to participate.</p>\n<p>“All people had to do was bring back blankets over break,” Ma said. “It’s a win-win for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Santa Catalina South Hall Council Environmental Awareness Chair and first-year psychology major Nina Masjedi said she donated to the drive.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a great way to help people and see a direct result on a local scale,” Masjedi said in an email. “It was a way for me to help in the community surrounding me.”</p>\n<p>Lugo said the program provided people an easy opportunity to help the local community.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure that everyone who attends this school also had to do some sort of community service, so it’s important to keep that going even though you’re already in college.” Lugo said. “It’s important to give back to the community and give to those that need it more than we do.”</p>\n<p>Lugo said the program can set a precedent for future years.</p>\n<p>“This sort of event is a good thing to continue,” Lugo said. “Even if a homeless shelter doesn’t have a shortage of blankets or if they have enough of what they need.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

During the Day of Remembrance, an altar was dedicated to victims of deadly hate crimes and La Familia de Colores members read the names of all documented trans-identified persons killed since last year’s day of remembrance.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Chican@ studies and black studies double major and La Familia de Colores Organizer Abigail Salazar said Reyes was being honored for fighting for justice and equality in the transgender community.</p>\n<p>“We have a space that queer trans Latino folks can exist in within this very violent institution we are in,” Salazar said. “But we still honor all the other trans women and trans women of color who have passed away due to state violence or other forms of violence.”</p>\n<p>Salazar said she hopes people understand the “urgency” of the situation.</p>\n<p>“There’s no coincidence that there’s such a long list of … trans women of color murders,” Salazar said. “We have to be conscious of that and learn how to be allies in order to really help our trans brothers and sisters to create change.”</p>\n<p>According to La Familia de Colores member and fourth-year black studies and feminist studies double major Ernie Piña, there are dozens of transgender deaths that go unreported each year.</p>\n<p>“This past year, I worked in conjunction with organizing on behalf of Jesse Hernandez … while I continued and continued to look for research on Jesse Hernandez, there was nothing that was reported,” Piña said. “There’s all these trans folks that are passing, but they’re not shown or given the opportunity to visibility that other people would have.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year comparative literature and global studies double major Kasey Rubio said the event should be more of a priority to the whole community.</p>\n<p>“Many women have been taken from us; I think everyone should be here to pay their respect,” Rubio said. “These are our fallen trans brothers and sisters. A lot of them we’ll never even know because most of them don’t get documented.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year Chican@ studies and sociology double major and La Familia de Colores Board Member Emmanuel Suarez-Jimenez, society continues to struggle with the changing norms and perceptions surrounding sexual identities and lifestyles.</p>\n<p>“We live in a really transphobic society that really doesn’t know how to deal with new ideas, new concepts, new theories of how people want to live their way,” Suarez-Jimenez said. “I think that’s one thing we all need to really understand, is that we all have our own identities, we all pick them.”</p>\n<p>Piña said problems with sexual and gender identities persist because people cannot accept differences.</p>\n<p>“Our society in general doesn’t accept trans bodies because they’re deviant from the norm. In terms of trans bodies, in terms of what gender is — is just seen as abstract or weird,” Piña said. “That’s where hate comes from, that’s where a lot of what drives them from being is that people don’t understand.”</p>\n<p>Piña said many people do not comprehend the physical transitions of many transgender people.</p>\n<p>“Folks don’t understand — imagine living in this body or this existence where you don’t feel comfortable with the way you express your gender or you don’t feel comfortable in the way you are,” Piña said. “That’s what trans folks do; they make themselves so they can feel comfortable in their bodies.”</p>\n<p>Suarez-Jimenez said individual activists have been instrumental in challenging societal norms, such as Marsha P. Johnson who is credited for being one of the first people to incite the Stonewall riots of 1969 in New York.</p>\n<p>“She’s a trans woman of color who threw the first stone, who started that police riot,” Suarez-Jimenez said. “She’s who finally started that momentum rolling on the fact that we really need to acknowledge that there are different identities and we need to accept them and we need to challenge ourselves to be more accepting.”</p>\n<p>Rubio said the Transgender Day of Remembrance provided an atmosphere to honor lost lives and focus on preventing future tragedies.</p>\n<p>“This type of event is just a beautiful space to grieve and to mourn, but also to reflect and look to the future and think about what we want to change and how we’re going to do that, so that we don’t have to continuously be holding these spaces for those that have been murdered,” Rubio said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-66696\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Latino/a UCSB Network Association and the Asian Pacific Islander Alliance hosted “Calling In: Cultivating Racial Consciousness &amp; Inclusivity” on Thursday, where panelists discussed racial tensions on university campuses across the country.</p>\n<p>Recent racially charged incidents — such as those at University of Missouri, Yale, UCLA, University of Michigan, University of Oklahoma and Harvard University – are raising the question of how UCSB staff and faculty can better serve as allies to students of color. Four panelists at the event, Lisa Slavid, Diane Fujino, Aaron Jones and Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, spoke about why U.S. campuses are experiencing racial tensions, how racial consciousness manifests itself on college campuses, how to speak on race in a classroom and freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>Professor of Asian American studies Diane Fujino said while the Civil Rights Movement eliminated formal discrimination, it was “insufficient” at combatting all race issues.</p>\n<p>“Racism has changed,” Fujino said. “The work in the ’50s was to legitimate that racism existed and it was wrong, but today, there is more knowledge that racism is wrong, and the work today is really to prove that it still exists.”</p>\n<p>Graduate Student Association President Aaron Jones said racism is still present in everyday society.</p>\n<p>“It is in all things,” Jones said. “If you’re a fish in water, you can’t see the water, doesn’t mean you’re not in the water. We’re living in it, we’re breathing in it. It’s in our society, so of course, it’s going to be manifested on a college campus.”</p>\n<p>Coordinator of organizational and performance management for Housing and Residential Services at UCSB Lisa Slavid said she is not surprised to see racial consciousness manifest on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“Really, where else in the country would they manifest?” Slavid asked. “Colleges are part of the institutions of the country, and these conversations need to happen. They won’t be happening in the companies or corporations of Google or Facebook or J.C. Penny, they will be emerging here.”</p>\n<p>Jones said college campuses should be safe, educational spaces for discussing racial issues.</p>\n<p>“We’re supposed to be able to engage in these kinds of dialogues. If we can’t have those types of dialogues and conversations in a university, then we’re in really bad shape,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Associate professor of Chican@ studies Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval said such conversations should not be limited to certain majors.</p>\n<p>“Even in Chicano studies, we feel like we need to talk about Black Lives Matter,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “We don’t think that this is something that should be in one department, in one discipline. We need to talk about Black Lives Matter in our own department, in our own community.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said people need to discuss their different views and opinions to begin a dialogue.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people have a problem with the name ‘Black Lives Matter,’ and that’s okay, but we need to talk about this,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “How are we going to work this through otherwise? It’s not easy to have a conversation about these things — it’s a very difficult thing to walk through, but I don’t think it was fair for people not to talk about it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66697\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"251323568\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66709\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66697\" data-attachment-id=\"66697\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/regents-form-group-to-protect-students-from-intolerance/intolerance_by-vivian-bui-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447936053\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"1800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Consciousness/Calling In\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66697 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66697\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Slavid said conversations about racial issues may be difficult because of fear.</p>\n<p>“There’s a silence, and it’s mostly because people are afraid,” Slavid said. “They’re afraid to say the wrong thing.”</p>\n<p>Fujino said these conversations can be difficult to approach in a class setting, but faculty and staff must work to appropriately address the issues.</p>\n<p>“For professors, it’s trial and error and if we’re dedicated, we talk to colleagues to figure it out,” Fujino said. “There is increasing attention to issues of what they call ‘diversity,’ that means it’s built instructionally. The faculty need to create a space in classrooms so that people can speak, and I also think what it takes is to evaluate and listen to each other.”</p>\n<p>According to Slavid, faculty and staff can be allies at UCSB by trusting and listening to students’ perspectives.</p>\n<p>“As a white ally, recognize that people of color’s lived experiences are different than yours,” Slavid said. “Show up, listen to learn, but also know when to speak as an ally, even if it makes you nervous, because our silence on topics of racial injustice is part of the issue.”</p>\n<p>Associate Director of LGBT Services in the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity Klint Jaramillo said he knows students with questions about racial issues want to have conversations.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can move forward and make spaces like this for faculty and staff so we can not only support each other, but support our students,” Jaramillo said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66709\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66709\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/","id":2587,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2586,2585,2584],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Pardall Center to provide the community with food and information on local resources.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Resource Fair is a public event which will feature several different organizations, including Committee of Student Well Being (COSWB), I.V. Food Co-Op, Department of Public Worms, Health and Wellness and Environment Affairs Board. The organizations will offer information about their resources, answer questions and host free food giveaways.</p>\n<p>IVCRC publicity manager and third-year global studies major Lauren Lim said the Resource Fair will bring people together in I.V., which is the goal of IVCRC.</p>\n<p>“As IVCRC, our goal and intention for having this committee to begin with is to bring this community together — bring everyone together — and I think the Resource Fair is a great way [to do so],” Lim said. “Not just for UCSB students to know what resources are available for them, but because it’s in I.V., we can have families come, and different people around the community come.”</p>\n<p>Lim said the event will inform attendees of the resources available to them provided by multiple I.V. and UCSB organizations.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of people don’t know what’s available to them, and to have this [event] and present it to them in one day, in one space …” Lim said. “I’m excited for it to become a really big part of what we do as a community.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC external chair and third-year art and sociology double-major Aimee Hanna said she is looking forward to the event and what it can offer to the community.</p>\n<p>“This event is about feeding people, letting people know all about the resources that are available to them and allowing for these things to become accessible,” Hanna said. “It’s for folks to really come together and realize how we can all come together to make a better community.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC secretary and third-year psychology major Tai Kang said A.S. Food Bank Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen inspired the decision to host the I.V. Resource Fair.</p>\n<p>“When Aimee and I first got our positions in IVCRC, we were really interested in food security,” Kang said. “I suggested it to Aimee because I read a bunch of articles on food security, so we went to the Food Bank, where we met Tuyen, and she was the one who gave us the idea for the Resource Fair.”</p>\n<p>According to Kang, Nguyen asked IVCRC to take on the project because A.S. Food Bank lacked the time and resources.</p>\n<p>“We have all the student lock-ins and the fees to do so, and it’d be a great resource to the students,” Kang said. “I think that big thanks has to [go to] Tuyen because she was truly the one who inspired us to do this.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said the I.V. Resource Fair has been in the works for some time, though it has been unsuccessful until now.</p>\n<p>“It was something that some of our previous leadership wanted to do last year, and we started to do a couple resource fairs with some community folks to begin to look at and model,” Nguyen said. “Something that already exists in the community, such as the Healthy Food pantry provided by the Isla Vista Youth Projects.”</p>\n<p>According to Nguyen, A.S. Food Bank met with IVCRC over the summer, during which the committee chose to pick up the project.</p>\n<p>“We’re super thankful to them to put forth their resources and attention,” Nguyen said. “They are amazing and they’re actually the lead; we’re here to actually just be a partner in their particular project.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said A.S. Food Bank will provide food at the I.V. Resource Fair.</p>\n<p>“Our role would be to help support and provide pantry items,” Nguyen said. “We have a variety of produce that folks can sift through, but this is a way in which we can provide a different access.”</p>\n<p>Second-year environmental science major Colleen McCamy said she is looking forward to the event.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a really cool event,” McCamy said. “[It’s] helpful for students to explore the different resources here in the community and on campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66171\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66171\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/","id":4624,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[4623,4622,4621],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Organizations Host Talk on North Korea Refugees","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Korea_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Korea_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara Delta Sigma Pi and the Korean American Student Association (KASA) co-hosted members of Liberty in North Korea (LINK) to speak on North Korean refugees Friday evening at Broida Hall.

At Friday’s event, representatives discussed conditions in North Korea, the challenges of escaping the country and how the organization aids refugees.</p>\n<p>LINK member John Park said North Koreans are “just like you and me” but come from very different circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There’s 24 million people in North Korea, full of hopes, dreams, families and relationships,” Park said. “The only difference is between here and there; they are living in one of the most suppressive countries in this world today.”</p>\n<p>Park said the Kim dynasty has convinced North Korean citizens of a “different reality.”</p>\n<p>“They tell them that the outside world is full of stress and enemies and they have to put their faith in their leaders,” Park said. “Their regime puts forth incredible time and resources to make people believe in their strict version of socialism.”</p>\n<p>According to Park, the North Korean government controls its citizens through censorship and isolation.<br>\n“To prevent their people from seeing the outside world, North Korea has an information and media blockade,” Park said. “They cannot make international phone calls, they are banned from foreign radio or watching foreign television.”</p>\n<p>Park said there is little resistance to the Kim dynasty’s rule because of the severe penalties in place for dissonance.</p>\n<p>“If you are suspected of defying the regime, they conduct harsh interrogation with you and your entire family and may place you in a political prison camp,” Park said. “The estimated number is 80 to 120 thousand people kept in these prisons, including entire families. We’ve heard the regime uses torture, starvation, and even execution in order to keep people in line.”</p>\n<p>According to Park, thousands of North Koreans have escaped to China since the 1990s as a form of “quiet disobedience.”</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the direct travel to South Korea is blocked by the DMZ, the Demilitarized Zone, so thousands of North Koreans travel to China,” Park said. “But even if they make it to China, the Chinese government does not recognize North Koreans as refugees.”</p>\n<p>Park said if refugees are caught by the Chinese government, they are deported to North Korea where they may face forced labor and torture.</p>\n<p>“If they get caught, they will be sent back, and there, they will be faced with grave punishments for leaving the government,” Park said.</p>\n<p>North Korean refugee Min Sung said the challenges and potential consequences refugees face are better than continuing to live in suppression.</p>\n<p>“You only live on Earth once; I want to live it in freedom,” Sung said.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi member and second-year undeclared major Athena Wan said she hopes people who attended the event will support LINK in the future.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wanted to bring this organization to my campus, and I finally did it in college because I feel like it’s a really good organization and, like, they have a really great cause,” Athena said. “Since we have the materials to help them with, I feel like we should all try to participate. I hope this event spreads awareness on their cause and their organization.”</p>\n<p>KASA member and third-year sociology major Samantha Chang said she applauds LINK’s mission.</p>\n<p>“I’m glad to see a group is doing something to potentially be political but doing it for the people,” Chang said. “I feel like it’s hard to convey a non-political stance these days. So their efforts to resettle North Korean refugees is really amazing.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year anthropology major Connie Kim said the event helped her further understand the challenges North Koreans face.</p>\n<p>“I just knew that it was hard living in North Korea and they didn’t have rights, but I feel more informed,” Kim said.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Peter Dang said although the issues discussed at the event are geographically distant, the UCSB community should participate in a solution.</p>\n<p>“We can still make a difference and be able to make life better for people that we will never meet and for a cause that is important to those people,” Dang said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/","id":4614,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[4613,4612,4611],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/125"}},"__N_SSG":true}
