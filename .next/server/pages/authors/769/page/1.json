Spoilers Ahead! </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Horse Girl,” a new Netflix 2020 drama, is something very different and unexpected. The two-hour-long drama keeps you actively engaged in the story as well as keeps you curious as to how the film will eventually end. Actress Alison Brie, known for her roles in productions like “BoJack Horseman” and “Community,” co-wrote the screenplay alongside director Jeff Baena and starred in the film as its lead character Sarah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah, a young woman whose lucid dreams become intensely vivid, struggles in differentiating these fantasies from reality. Brie does a remarkable job of surfacing many different emotions as well as evoking several emotions from the viewer with her portrayal of Sarah. You feel her discomfort, stress and unease in every scene as almost as if you were actually there. “Horse Girl” is undoubtedly a psychedelic trip of a movie, often leaving the viewer to question what is actually happening. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film provides you with many plausible explanations for Sarah’s behavior including cloning,  alien abduction, borderline schizophrenia and a history of mental illness within her family. From the very beginning, you can easily tell that Sarah doesn’t blend well with others in her life — simply put, she just doesn’t fit in. For the most part, Sarah believes that she is a clone of her grandmother, constantly comparing their uncanny resemblances. Sarah, already being an awkward character from the jump, only then begins to suffer from events that resemble schizophrenic episodes. But it’s more than that; there’s a mysterious and unexplained layer roaming over the plot throughout the film. Only at the end does everything get pieced together, but you are still left without the satisfaction that anything truly got resolved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way in which this film’s sequence of events is carried out is very well done. Its depiction of time is one of constant bending and overlapping, forcing you to reevaluate your original thoughts and recall scenes that occurred in the film’s beginning. In short, every scene within “Horse Girl” is imperative to its central plot. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92816\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1814919151\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92815\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92816\" data-attachment-id=\"92816\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/the-daily-caller/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?fit=1200%2C516&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,516\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Daily Caller\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?fit=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?fit=888%2C382&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92816\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=888%2C382\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=1024%2C440&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=768%2C330&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92816\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The Daily Caller</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that being said, there were some plot holes as well as certain depictions that seemed a bit excessive and exaggerated. Right as the film hits its climax, Sarah goes on a rather pointless venture dressed as a “pink ninja” — this scene seems as if it was created just to emphasize a trippy and kaleidoscopic aesthetic and ruins the initial effect of using all these distracting scenes in the first place. Then, there’s the mystery of her mother’s death and Sarah’s relationship with her stepfather. Both storylines are introduced, but neither are ever taken into more depth. The film implies that her past has a heavy and murky influence on both her personality and current ticks. Sadly, the viewer is only given a very minimal outlook on that part of Sarah’s life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another plot hole within the film would be that of the DNA test that Sarah takes about halfway through the film. The test was suggested to her by her coworker who had taken the test herself to discover more about her genetics. Sarah never receives the results for this test and instead just assumes that they are inconclusive. The DNA test, as well as a traumatic horse riding accident, are both ignored for the majority of the film. We are introduced to a childhood friend of Sarah’s that was immensely affected by the incident, but we are never truly given a reason to how this is relevant to the central plot — it seems as if it was put in just to fill time. Sarah’s obsession with horses and her discontinuation of riding them is also never fully addressed or explained. Her stepfather is decently wealthy, so even the sale of her horse doesn’t add up. These little intricacies distract from the main storyline and poorly develop Sarah’s overall character.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the film’s soundtrack, it was performed and composed by Josiah Steinbrick and Jeremy Zuckerman; this will be both composers’ first major accredited work in film. The music fits well with the theme of the film and highlights the anxiety-inducing and dramatic scenes very well. Its use of synth and tranquil sounds resembling wind chimes synchronizes nicely with the overall tone of the scenes. If you were simply to listen to the original soundtrack alone, it would be very similar to one that is played in the background at a spa. </span></p>\n<p><b>Overall Rating:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 8/10 — Aside from the abundant release of dramas premiering on Netflix recently, this film does take a different and interesting approach, compiled of many puzzling and somewhat cringy scenes. Nonetheless, I would suggest that people still see this film. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92815\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92815\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/","id":5747,"author":{"id":769,"name":"Arielle Bitton"},"related":[5746,5745,5744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In Review: “Dolittle”","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2020-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMDb.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMDb.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I had wondered where RDJ would go after leaving a multi-billion dollar franchise;

Downey’s time as Tony Stark, over a decade long, has yet to be beaten by the numerous other characters he has portrayed. I had wondered where Downey would go after leaving a multi-billion dollar franchise; never would I have guessed that the next character he would portray would be that of Dr. Dolittle. His new film, “Dolittle,” contains an all-star cast, including Selena Gomez, Antonio Banderas, Tom Holland, Emma Thompson and many more.</p>\n<p>While Eddie Murphy’s take on the role is seen as a “classic,” at least through the eyes of a child, Downey’s take is very different — the entire story and its characters have no relation to Murphy’s 1998 “Dr. Dolittle.” The plot of the newest rendition consists of Dr. Dolittle living in solitude with his many exotic animals as he grieves the loss of his wife. He is then visited by attendants of Queen Victoria who seek Dolittle’s help in retrieving a cure for her. The action-packed film, with its both humorous and sentimental dialogue, primes it to be an enjoyable watch for all ages. With that being said, it does not exceed any more depth than that of a plain, generic family film.</p>\n<p>The special effects were positively breathtaking, with every scene showcasing an abundance of vibrant colors. Though the scenes were stunning, they were often messy. The transitions between locations make your head want to spin, and they cram so many different obstacles in various locations that the development is completely lost.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As for Downey’s acting, his accent was different, and his overall portrayal was fun. Downey’s accent is not characteristic of a common British accent, but instead takes more of an eccentric approach. Halfway through the movie, you begin to realize why Downey doesn’t speak in the trailer — his accent is distracting, outrageous, and in other words, overdone. Playing such a serious and dramatic character for so many years, I can see why Downey agreed to join a project so light. Downey is a great actor and this role does not diminish his talent, but it also does not challenge him.</p>\n<p>Stephen Gaghan directed “Dolittle,” which is quite a surprise considering that his past films consist of drama and crime, surely not that of CGI’d talking animals. Gaghan’s shots were very predictable and rather cliche in trying to draw out emotion from the audience. Gaghan’s jump to fantasy was a bit of a stretch, and he is much better suited within the drama and crime realm.</p>\n<p>The music was scored by Danny Elfman, the same man who composed the music for films such as “Beetlejuice,” “Good Will Hunting,” the “Men in Black” franchise, Tim Burton’s “Corpse Bride” and the “Fifty Shades of Grey” franchise, just to name a few. The music for this film was objectively the best part of it. With such big movies already on Elfman’s roster, this comes as no surprise. The grand emotional strides of the strings and the suspenseful beats sweep you off your feet and wrap you in sweet and dramatic emotions.</p>\n<p>Overall, a 6.5/10 rating, this movie is not something that anyone above the age of nine should be running to the theaters to see. This is simply another film looking for a profit, bringing nothing special or surprising to the table.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that “Dolittle” was a Disney film. “Dolittle” is a Universal Pictures film. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Netflix recently released a new original series, “Living with Yourself,” where Rudd plays two of the main characters. When bingeing this latest series, I was in complete awe of Rudd’s acting range. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rudd does a phenomenal job portraying two very opposing personalities of the same character: one of increasing depression and self-pity, and the other, though in a more “healthy” state of mind, struggling with his understanding of his own existence. “Living with Yourself” is all about a middle-aged man who has hit quite a thick wall, and in complete desperation, searches for an easy fix. Not to give too much away, but imagine if there was a procedure that took all the best parts of you and put it in an identical body. The clone, compiled of all the best parts of its original, is supposed to be able to reach all the aspirations that his original (Rudd’s character) has failed to achieve. This makes it very interesting to watch both versions of the same person cohabitate, and rather poorly at that. Imagine having to live with a better version of yourself that harbors none of the negative traits that limit your ability to succeed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each episode is shown from different perspectives of the characters — this tactic helps fill in the gaps within the previous episodes. Throughout the series I found myself in a constant internal dispute, trying to figure out which character would be acceptable for me to sympathize with or pity. With alternating perspectives, you slowly pick up on where the characters’ feelings are resonating from; this show truly challenges a person’s views on what actions make certain events inevitable. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this self-evaluating and reconstructing of Rudd’s character’s life occurs while he and his wife are trying to get pregnant.

However, the original Miles begins to notice how much better the clone is at living his life than he was, leading to the destruction of any self-esteem he may have had left. Of course, this then leads to extreme resentment and jealousy toward the upgraded version of himself. It was quite fascinating to watch the character struggle that occurs between Miles and his clone; this is where I truly believe that Rudd executed an outstanding performance. He is responding and reacting to himself, all while not actually being able to receive it in real time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While sharing his life with a clone and each approaching certain situations with different attitudes, you can really see the different outcomes that arise. Just by viewing this in the first few episodes, it made me think back to many occasions in my life, and how approaching specific things in a different way could’ve changed my present entirely. The bad thing about realizing this about the past is that there is no longer anything you can do to change it. But, knowing this in the present can very much help you better assess the situation and respond in more “beneficial” ways that will lead to the future you and the overall life you desire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This new Netflix series, “Living with Yourself,” demonstrates the boundless talents of Rudd as he perfectly executes a difficult performance of accessing different views and emotions of the same character, all while mastering the comprehension that they are separate entities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8.5/10 — Brilliant acting matched with brilliant writing.
