Santa Barbara’s four-game win streak was effectively snapped by the Anteaters as Irvine outscored the Gauchos by 9 points in the second half to take the victory. UCSB now sits at 6-10 overall and second in Big West standings at 3-1. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">UC Davis, the only Big West team undefeated in conference play, will visit the Thunderdome this Thursday in a meeting of the early Big West frontrunners.

Against Irvine, Toler did a bit of everything for the Gauchos, recording 9 points, 5 assists, and 5 boards.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first quarter of play found Santa Barbara and Irvine both struggling to efficiently find the net, shooting a combined 11 for 34 from the field. While the Gauchos also went 1-6 from beyond the arc in the first, Drew Edelman went to work in the paint, scoring 9 of her team-high 18 points in the decently-even quarter. Morgan Green got to the line with 11 seconds left to knock down two free throws to put Irvine behind 17-18 heading into the second.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the second, Drew Toler scored 7 of her 9 points as Santa Barbara held the Anteaters to just 14 points. The Gauchos went on a scoring drought that last over three minutes, but threes by Tal Sahar and Toler towards the end of the first half extended their lead to 37-31.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">In the third, it was Irvine making the push, as the Anteaters held Santa Barbara to 14 points and closed out the quarter on an 8-0 run thanks to Morgan Green and Lauren Saiki.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Green and Saiki each scored 8 points in the third. Green finished the night with a game-high 25 points and 6 rebounds. The run by the Anteaters gave Irvine a 53-51 lead going into the final 10 minutes of play.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">In a high-scoring fourth quarter, Irvine outscored the Gauchos 24-23 to complete the comeback effort. Although UCSB closed out the game with their last 12 points coming from three pointers, the Anteaters managed to make all 8 of their free throws in the fourth to keep in front of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yazzy Sa’Dullah knocked down two from the line with 18 seconds left to put the Anteaters up 6. Sarah Porter managed to hit a three with 2 seconds remaining as part of her 8-point quarter, but it was too late for the Gauchos.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Losing only by 3 points, Santa Barbara has to be disappointed, but the continual growth of the Gauchos this season is perhaps a silver lining head coach Bonnie Henrickson can find in this game. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Gauchos matched the Anteaters in many aspects and even held the advantage in the paint as well as in terms of bench production. UCSB outscored Irvine 28-22 down low and got 26 points from its bench, but the difference in the game seemed to be free-throws. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the Anteaters managed to go 18 for 23 from the charity stripe, the Gauchos only made 8 of their 15 free throws. Santa Barbara with its 23 personal fouls committed marks a season-high for the Gauchos.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite giving Irvine 18 points from free-throws, UCSB’s offense has now scored 70 points or higher in 5 of its last 6 games. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Drew Edelman with another double-double is almost averaging one with 14 ppg and 9.4 rebounds per game. As Santa Barbara’s offense is rolling, the Gauchos will likely work on their defensive game-plan this week before playing Thursday in an effort to cut down on fouls. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the Gauchos work Drea Toler back into games, Santa Barbara will aim to get back on track at home against UC Davis on Thursday, January 18.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80545\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-14/gauchos-suffer-first-conf-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80545\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-14/gauchos-suffer-first-conf-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-14/gauchos-suffer-first-conf-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-14/gauchos-suffer-first-conf-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-14/gauchos-suffer-first-conf-loss-at-uc-irvine/","id":837,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[836,835,834],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hang on to Win Blue-Green Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Blue-Green rivalry ended in favor of UCSB when the final buzzer went off.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB women’s team survived a late Cal Poly comeback effort on Saturday to open the first week of Big West play 2-0. Starting the fourth quarter the Gauchos were ahead of the Mustangs by 19 points, but a Mustang effort to make the game interesting prompted a 14-2 run during a stretch in the final quarter. Without a field goal for over four minutes, the Gauchos were lucky enough to make enough free throws in the end, coming out on top 73-68.</p>\n<p>Although conference season is far from over, the Gauchos now sit at second in the Big West behind fellow 2-0 UC Davis. After starting the season 1-9, Santa Barbara, now 5-9,  has won its last four games, effectively turning the season around for conference play. Head coach Bonnie Henrickson knows there’s still room for improvement, “We aren’t where we were, we aren’t where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction.”</p>\n<p>With Cal Poly’s comeback effort falling short, the Mustangs settle back in to .500, 1-1 in the Big West and 7-7 overall. Cal Poly’s senior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who came into the game off a 40-point performance in an overtime win over UC Riverside, had a game-high 30 points on 27 shots at the Thunderdome. In an off night shooting for Leaupepe and her teammates, Cal Poly finished the game 26 for 70 from the field.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first quarter of play found both teams locked at 0-0 until the 6:42 mark, when Makala Roper drove the lane and finished, giving the Gauchos the 2-0 lead. Roper, a senior, had 7 of her 15 points in the first quarter, and finished the game with a career high 9 assists. Bringing defensive energy early, Santa Barbara held the Mustangs to just 8 points off 18 percent shooting in the quarter, leading 11-8 heading into the second.</p>\n<p>“I know everything can get flustered,” said Roper post-game, “and I’m the point guard so I need to make sure everyone’s calm. I have to make sure to have a level head so everything is okay.”</p>\n<p>Despite Cal Poly’s terrible shooting effort in the first, the Mustangs continued to put pressure on Santa Barbara in a variety of press and trap defenses. Obviously feeling this pressure, the Gauchos turned the ball over 8 times in the first quarter alone and went on to turn it over 7 more times in the second.</p>\n<p>In the high-octane second quarter, Santa Barbara outscored Cal Poly 28-16 to take a 39-24 going into halftime. The Gauchos had no problem finding the net, shooting over 60 percent overall and from downtown. Dynn Leaupepe put her team on her back in the quarter, scoring 13 of her team’s 16 points, but it wasn’t enough to counter the Gauchos’ weapon off the bench: Tal Sahar. Sahar, who didn’t log a single minute in the team’s victory over Long Beach on Thursday, came alive in the second to score all of her 17 points in the quarter. The redshirt sophomore said after the game, “From the first shot I took, I was like, okay, this is going to be a good game.” Sahar’s energy was part of an 11-2 UCSB run to open the quarter, forcing a Mustang timeout.</p>\n<p>Senior Chaya Durr spoke following the game, addressing Sahar’s contribution. “Tal came in with great minutes off the bench and got us hyped up as well,” Durr said, “She was knocking down shots and we were just feeding off of it. It was just working.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had another hot quarter in the third, shooting 50 percent from three. While Dynn Leaupepe herself scored another 7 in the quarter, Sarah Bates and Chaya Durr each had 8 for UCSB and Roper added 6 as the Gauchos outscored the Mustangs 24-20. Durr finished the game with 10 points and 8 boards, hitting a three at the buzzer to put her team up 63-44 heading into the final quarter.</p>\n<p>Up by 19 with just 10 minutes left to play, the Gauchos seemed in control. After the Mustangs hit a pair of threes, Drew Edelman made a layup with 6:50 left to give Santa Barbara a comfortable 17-point lead. With 11 points and a game-high 10 boards, Edelman finished with a double-double on an efficient 5 of 7 shooting.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs refused to go away, though, organizing a trapping press defense that flustered the Gauchos. Facing the pressure, Santa Barbara lost possession a total 10 times in the fourth to record a season-high 33 turnovers on the night. The Mustangs took advantage of Santa Barbara’s mistakes, scoring 39 points off turnovers over the course of the game, but it wasn’t until the final quarter that Cal Poly closed the gap. An 11-0 Poly run forced a UCSB timeout with just 2:55 remaining, the Gauchos now only ahead 67-61. Their 19-point lead diminished to just 6, the Gauchos regrouped during the timeout to extend their lead to 8 off a Roper jumpshot. In desperation mode, the Mustangs got a quick three-ball and a layup to fall, moving within three of the Gauchos, 66-69 with just under 2 minutes to go. With 55 seconds left, Sarah Bates got to the rim with a nice move for an and-one. The freshman guard, who finished with 17, completed the three-point play to give her team the 72-66 point lead. With time running out, Cal Poly was forced to fire up some quick shots, but it was too little, too late. The Gauchos survived the comeback effort, holding on to win 73-68.</p>\n<p>With 33 turnovers, the Gauchos’ win over Cal Poly has some areas of concern for head coach Bonnie Henrickson, but also some positives. “Clearly, we’ve got to be better with more poise and composure,” said Henrickson, “I thought Chaya [Durr] defensively was really good on Dynn [Leaupepe], I thought our scouting report defense was really good.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now have two road games ahead of them, versus CSU Northridge and UC Irvine this coming week. On a winning streak and still making improvements, 2-0 Santa Barbara is certainly eager to continue Big West play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/","id":819,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[818,817,816],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast 49ers in Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"The Big West season is officially underway, and the UCSB women's basketball team has its first win.

The Gauchos have now won their last three games and with Thursday night’s win over the 49ers Santa Barbara is 1-0 in conference play, improving their overall record to 4-9. While UCSB is rolling compared to the start of the season, the 49ers are pushed to a dismal 2-13 overall as they open league play with their sixth straight loss.</p>\n<p>A rematch of last year’s Big West Championship, in which Long Beach got the best of the Gauchos, Thursday night’s game opened with an energy in the Thunderdome signaling the return of conference-play atmosphere. The 49ers pressured Santa Barbara using a 3-2 zone along with a full-court press disrupting the Gauchos’ offense early. Shots weren’t falling easily for either team and the Gauchos had a difficult time keeping possession, turning the ball over 7 times in the first quarter alone.</p>\n<p>For nearly the first seven minutes of play, UCSB had only 3 points off a Drew Edelman free throw and a jumper by Danae Miller. The defensive battle had the score locked at 5-3 Long Beach before Makala Roper knocked down a three for the Gauchos with 3:38 remaining. A few back and forth buckets closed out the quarter 12-12.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson said following the game, “Sometimes you’ve got to be able to handle that this might one of those nights, it might be in the forties and fifties and you’ve got to be comfortable doing that,” said Henrickson, “You’ve got to be able to play through that and still win in the fifties.”</p>\n<p>Makala Roper got things going for Santa Barbara in the second quarter, draining her second three ball of the night to put the Gauchos ahead 15-12. Long Beach responded by going on an 8-0 run, forcing head coach Bonnie Henrickson to call a quick timeout with roughly 6:04 remaining. Out of the 30-second timeout, the Gauchos went inside to find Edelman in back to back possessions for two easy buckets. Edelman asserted herself in the paint throughout the game, getting good position as well as good looks at the basket, but had a hard time getting shots to fall. The redshirt senior did have a career night rebounding the ball, grabbing 23 boards while just missing a double-double with 9 points. Roper kept heating up, making another shot from beyond the arc to put the Gauchos down a single point heading into halftime 22-23.</p>\n<p>The first half of play featured both squads struggling to find the net, as UCSB and Long Beach each shot close to 31 percent overall and 27 percent from three-point territory. Edelman had 13 of her final 23 rebounds at half, but UCSB also committed 13 turnovers in the half.</p>\n<p>In spite of their rough start shooting, the Gauchos came out after halftime with a re-focused energy on both ends of the court. Santa Barbara opened the third on a 9-0 run, holding the 49ers scoreless for almost 5 minutes. UCSB went on to score 17 total points in the quarter, with Sarah Bates, Sarah Porter and again Roper chipping in a three-pointer each. Roper’s three came at the buzzer to lift the Gauchos to a 39-28 advantage after three quarters of play. The 49ers had a rough quarter to say the least, going 1-10 from the field, 0-4 from three, and 3-10 from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>Makala Roper made another three to kick off the fourth quarter for her game and season-high 15 points, all from beyond the arc. Long Beach guard Shanijah Davison got to the line on the following possession, converting 1 of 2 free throws. The freshman Davison had a difficult night, shooting only 1-10 from the field and finishing the game with 4 points. Heading into the game, Davison was the 49ers’ leading scorer with 11.9 points per game. 49er Cecily Wilson knocked down 1 of 2 shots from the line shortly after Davison, but the Gauchos answered with an Akilah Jennings three to take their largest lead of the night, up 15, with 8:50 remaining.</p>\n<p>Down 45-30 with just 8:50 left, 49ers refused to back off as Long Beach upped their defensive pressure to disrupt the Gauchos. After Akilah jennings made a nice move to the basket for a bucket at the 6:51 mark, the Gauchos failed to make another shot aside from free throws. Long Beach used their defensive stops to generate offense, going on a 10-0 run over the next 6 minutes to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to 3. Cecily Wilson had 7 of her team-high 9 points in the fourth to go with her team-high 10 rebounds. Down 47-44 with 53 seconds left, Long Beach mistakenly fouled Sarah Bates, sending her to the line where she knocked down the two free throws. Sloppy play and a variety of weird calls by the referees found the 49ers forced to send Bates to the line again with only 3 seconds to go. Bates came up clutch at the line again, hitting both shots to give the Gauchos the 51-44 victory.</p>\n<p>After the game, the freshman guard Bates discussed her team’s improved play in the third quarter. “I think we got a little more used to the pressure, but we were still struggling with it. It was our offense more than their defense, even though they’re a good defensive team,” said Bates.</p>\n<p>Following the Gauchos’ 1-9 start in the regular season, the Gauchos finally have momentum and a growing identity when they play. “I mean it’s a lot better than being 1-9,” said Drew Edelman, “We have a little bit more confidence going in. Especially now that it’s conference play, we said, ‘Ok whatever our record was preseason ultimately it doesn’t matter, it’s all about conference.’”</p>\n<p>With a big game against rival Cal Poly on Saturday, Santa Barbara is hoping to carry its energy further into conference play. “It was a process, we’ve learned from it. So now, new season, we’re 1 and 0,” continued Edelman.</p>\n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson is looking to continue her team’s growth this season, as beating the now 2-13 49ers is not as daunting as a task as beating Cal Poly. “So, we’re fortunate to find a way to win, but that locker room is mature enough to know we weren’t very good and we’ve got to be better on Saturday, and we’ll get a chance to be better on  Saturday,” said Henrickson, “And we’re mature enough to recognize that.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly for the Blue-Green rivalry game Saturday afternoon, with tip-off scheduled for 2:00pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80396\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80396\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/","id":781,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[780,779,778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Host Long Beach and Cal Poly to Open Big West Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-14-17_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_1-14-17_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The start of conference play just might be the best complement to UCSB recent win streak as it heads home to host LBSU and Cal Poly.

Thursday’s game against the 49ers seems like it will be a favorable matchup for UCSB, as Long Beach is in the midst of a five-game slide and sit at 2-12 overall this season.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their sub-par record, the 49ers are being led by promising freshman Shanaijah Davison. The 5’8 guard is averaging a team-high 11.9 points per game, and put up 29 points versus USC earlier this season.</p>\n<p>With seven freshmen on the Long Beach roster, another promising player has been 6’5 center Emma Merriweather. Only a freshman, Merriweather has recorded an impressive 22 total blocks in addition to averaging 9.2 points and 5.7 boards per contest. Long Beach will be eager to snap their losing streak when it faces UCSB, but the Gauchos have some talent on their roster as well.</p>\n<p>As a redshirt senior, forward Drew Edelman hasn’t slowed down, leading the Gauchos through their rough patch with 15.2 points and just over 8 rebounds per game. Edelman has performed closer to her ability lately, posting a 25 and 10 double-double in Santa Barbara’s win over San Diego State while she continues to be a vocal leader for her team on both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>UCSB has some promising freshmen of its own, with first-year guard Sarah Bates coming up big in recent contests. Bates has scored in double figures in her last two games and is playing big minutes as a freshman, averaging a little over 25 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest between the 49ers and Gauchos will interestingly enough be a repeat of last year’s Big West Tournament championship game. Long Beach squeaked out the win over UCSB in a nail-biter, so the Gauchos are likely eager to redeem themselves on top of extending their winning streak.</p>\n<p>The action will tip off at the Thunderdome on Thursday, Jan. 4 at 7 p.m. as UCSB looks to earn just its second home victory this season.</p>\n<p>Win or lose against the 49ers on Thursday, Santa Barbara will have a short break before hosting rival Cal Poly at the Thunderdome for an afternoon contest on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have had their respective ups and downs this season, sitting at the .500 mark with a 6-6 record. Cal Poly will visit UC Riverside Thursday before heading to the Thunderdome. The Mustangs have been led by the senior duo of sisters Dynn and Lynn Leaupepe.</p>\n<p>The Leaupepe duo features Dynn scoring 15.7 ppg and Lynn averaging a close 14.1 ppg. UCSB was torched by Dynn in last year’s January game, as she scored a season-high 29 points in the Mustang victory so the Santa Barbara coaching staff will undoubtedly work towards containing her on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry game will tip off at 2 p.m. this Saturday, Jan. 6 as the Gauchos and Mustangs will both be looking for bragging rights in addition to improving their records.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/","id":770,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[769,768,767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Turn Things Around, Defeat Aztecs at Home to End Losing Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=900%2C596&ssl=1","description":"The drought finally ends for the UCSB women's basketball team after defeating SDSU.

But, more importantly, UCSB’s nine-game losing streak is over.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, SDSU has now fallen in its last two games and holds a record of 6-5.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Following the win, redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman understood the significance of earning the win before the winter break.</p>\n<p>“We all wanted to end it on a good note, come back here in a more positive light,” Edelman said. “It’s been [a question of] ‘when are we going to figure it out? ‘When are we going to get a win?,’ so it was just really imperative that we figured it out tonight and we did, so we were able to get it.”</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and SDSU started the game appearing a bit rusty on both ends of the court. After winning the tip, the Aztecs got things rolling with a Khalia Lark jumper. Lark later hit a three to score five of her team-high 14 points in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struggled offensively yet again in the first period of play, managing to score only 7 points. Sarah Bates got the Gauchos on the board to tie the game at 2-2, her only points of the quarter.</p>\n<p>A layup and a pair of free throws from redshirt senior Drew Edelman plus a single free throw by Chaya Durr rounded out the Santa Barbara 7-point effort. The Gauchos gave up an 8-1 run to the Aztecs to end the quarter, finding themselves down 16-7 and the subjects of an animated speech from their head coach. In the quarter, Santa Barbara shot a dismal 15.4 field goal percentage while going 0-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson spoke to her team’s performance after the game; “Sometimes you’ve got to find a way to win and remember how to win, it’s been a while. We’re capable of so much more, we’ve practiced well through all of this.”</p>\n<p>Despite their slow start and disappointing first quarter, the Gauchos turned things around in a major way in the second quarter. Shooting a much-improved 64.3 percent and going 5-of-8 from three-point land helped Santa Barbara put the Aztecs on their heels and take the lead going into halftime.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed energy on the defensive end, getting stops to build momentum as more of their shots fell on the other end. Locking down defensively, UCSB held SDSU to only 10 points in the quarter and forced the Aztecs to shoot 35.7 percent from the field. With 6:45 remaining in the half, Edelman got a layup to go off a nice feed from Sarah Bates to put the Gauchos within a point, 18-17.</p>\n<p>The teams traded buckets until close to the end of the quarter, when Henrickson subbed Tal Sahar into the game. Sahar entered the game with her team down 26-23 at the 2:13 mark. In the final minutes of the half, Sahar gave the Gauchos a 7-0 run to take their first lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The redshirt sophomore leaked out twice for fast break layups and hit a corner three; however, Sahar would not return until the end of the game. UCSB went into halftime with plenty of momentum from their 23-point quarter, up on the Aztecs 30-26.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Edelman spoke to her team’s defensive intensity following the game.</p>\n<p>“Usually the ability to take shots isn’t our problem, it’s definitely on the defensive end,” she said. “We were able to get a lot more stops tonight than we have been able to in the previous nights and also our communication has gotten a lot better.”</p>\n<p>Only up by four at the start of the second half, Santa Barbara found a way to keep its foot on the gas, scoring 27 points in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>With starting freshman point guard Danae Miller getting in foul trouble early, senior guard Makala Roper was tasked with more minutes. Roper controlled the ball and was instrumental in working the ball into Edelman. Henrickson had high praise for her senior guard at the end of the game.</p>\n<p>“[Roper] was really good for really long stretches, I mean really good,” Henrickson said. “She made good decisions with the ball, let go of it, keep it, drive it at the rim, she was good.”</p>\n<p>Edelman herself had a dominant quarter, scoring 15 points on 6-for-7 shooting.</p>\n<p>Roper ended the game with 11 points and a game-high 8 assists. With just over three minutes to go in the quarter, the game was close with the Gauchos up 45-40. Sarah Bates hit a three ball to extend the Santa Barbara lead to 8, then the Gauchos started pouring it on, going on a 12-0 run.</p>\n<p>With Santa Barbara rolling, SDSU was simply outmatched and looked dismantled. Edelman’s 15-point quarter was part of her season-high 25 points, and the talented forward pulled down 10 boards to record a double-double. Shooting 71.4 percent in the quarter, UCSB found itself up on the Aztecs 57-40 heading into the final ten minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter was SDSU’s best, as they score 24 points; however, it wasn’t enough to make the game interesting. Santa Barbara was outscored by four in the quarter, but the Gauchos converted 11 of 12 free throws to finish out the game and secure the victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Sarah Bates played the whole game for Santa Barbara, aside from going to the bench a few seconds before being summoned back due to foul trouble of her teammates. Bates was huge for her team in getting the win. The freshman had 15 points to go along with 7 boards and was a vocal leader on defense.</p>\n<p>In the first time since 1999, Santa Barbara defeated the Aztecs. SDSU struggled carrying out their game plan against the Gauchos, losing the battle in the paint by a ten-point deficit and being outrebounded 35-23.</p>\n<p>McKynzie Fort, the Aztecs’ leading scorer on the season, was handled well by the Santa Barbara defense, as she was held to just 10 points and a single rebound in 38 minutes.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now have a short break for the holidays before returning to action for its last non-conference game against New Mexico State next Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/","id":747,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[746,745,744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Reeling Gauchos Host Aztecs In Hopes of Earning First Home Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=900%2C596&ssl=1","description":"Losers of nine straight, the UCSB women's basketball team will look to pick up their second win of the season hosting San Diego State on Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_80012\" style=\"width: 485px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"559859990\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80294\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80012\" data-attachment-id=\"80012\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/danae-miller-moves-the-ball-up-the-court-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?fit=900%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,596\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Danae Miller moves the ball up the court.

In comparison to the youthful Santa Barbara lineup, the SDSU starters are predominantly seniors, with guard McKynzie Fort leading the charge for the Aztecs.</p>\n<p>Fort is a 5’9 guard and has led her team in scoring in 7 of SDSU’s games this season, averaging team high numbers in points as well as rebounding. In addition to her 16.4 points per game, Fort averages 5.4 boards per contest.</p>\n<p>While the Aztecs will certainly rely on production from their seniors, Santa Barbara will look to build off the performance against LMU Monday.</p>\n<p>Disregarding the final score, the Gauchos outscored the Lions in the second half and found success feeding the ball to Drew Edelman, who finished with 21 points and 8 boards on an efficient 9-13 shooting.</p>\n<p>When Edelman is having those types of games, it seems the Gauchos have an easier time on offense; however, Edelman’s success in the paint may simply be the result of Santa Barbara running its offense the way head coach Bonnie Henrickson desires.</p>\n<p>Henrickson has repeatedly stressed the need to swing the ball and find the open player, whether that equates to an open three or a feed inside.</p>\n<p>With two true freshman point guards in Danae Miller and Sarah Bates, Henrickson’s offense has taken time to be carried-out correctly, but UCSB is continuing to show glimpses of efficient ball movement.</p>\n<p>The only other player on the Santa Barbara roster averaging double-digit scoring is redshirt junior Sarah Porter. Porter is averaging 10.4 points a game despite shooting just 35 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>With almost every Gaucho on the UCSB roster playing at least 10 minutes per contest, each game brings the opportunity for players to give their team that necessary spark either off the bench or from the opening buzzer.</p>\n<p>Facing SDSU will be a good opportunity for the Gauchos to keep translating what they’ve been improving upon in practice to real-game scenarios against a more appropriate opponent than a top-ten team like UCLA.</p>\n<p>Showing progressive improvement, Santa Barbara has worked to cut down its turnover numbers, which have plagued the Gauchos much of this season.</p>\n<p>Averaging 16.7 turnovers per game, the Gauchos limited themselves to losing the ball only 11 times against LMU, their lowest number since the regular season opening win at Northern Arizona.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, UCSB showed more intensity on the defensive end facing LMU, recording 8 steals and forcing 19 turnovers. If Santa Barbara is able to build off of these improvements, the Gauchos may also solve their issue of slow starts.</p>\n<p>In their past three matchups, the Gauchos have failed to score more than 11 points in each first quarter, so Henrickson’s team will likely aim to get off to a better start against SDSU on Friday.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Aztecs hosted Santa Barbara and won by a margin of 14, so Friday’s matchup will also offer the Gauchos a chance at redemption.</p>\n<p>The action between UCSB and SDSU will tip off at 7:00 pm on Friday, December 22 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80294\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/reeling-gauchos-host-aztecs-in-hopes-of-earning-first-home-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80294\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/reeling-gauchos-host-aztecs-in-hopes-of-earning-first-home-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/reeling-gauchos-host-aztecs-in-hopes-of-earning-first-home-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/reeling-gauchos-host-aztecs-in-hopes-of-earning-first-home-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/reeling-gauchos-host-aztecs-in-hopes-of-earning-first-home-win/","id":206,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[205,204,203],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggles Continue Following Blowout Loss at No. 17 Oregon State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the second game of a three-match road trip, the Gauchos struggles continue as they have now dropped eight straight after 74-49 loss against the Beavers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As the Thomas Fire continues to rear its ugly head in the Santa Barbara area, the woes of regular season play are all too familiar for the UCSB Women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>With their 74-49 Saturday night loss to Oregon State at the Moda Center, the Gauchos extend their losing streak to eight games.

The Beavers are ranked 17th in the nation and will look to continue their strong regular season before starting competitive Pac-12 conference play.</p>\n<p>Saturday night’s game was held at the Moda Center in Portland, the home to the NBA’s Portland Trailblazers, for the Dam City Classic in which both the Men’s and Women’s OSU basketball teams compete.</p>\n<p>The game between UCSB and OSU started with a three-pointer made by freshman guard Danae Miller, giving Santa Barbara the early 3-0 lead. The Beavers responded with a trio of unanswered layups to take the 6-3 lead with 7:18 remaining in the first quarter of play.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, their early 3-0 lead would be their sole lead of the night. The low-scoring quarter was rounded out by a pair of buckets by Miller and senior forward Drew Edelman, while the Beavers used a well-rounded scoring effort to lead 14-7 heading into the second quarter.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled shooting the ball to start the game, notching a sub-par shooting percentage of 15 percent from the floor and an even worse 12 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter, Santa Barbara managed to score 11 points, all from Edelman and redshirt sophomore Tal Sahar.</p>\n<p>Edelman finished the game with 10 points and 4 rebounds, while Sahar led the Gauchos with a season-high 11 points and 7 boards despite shooting 5-17 from the field and going 1-9 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Edelman and Sahar were the lone Gauchos to score in double figures. Oregon State heated up in the second, exploding for 27 points to build a 41-18 lead at the half. Another diversified scoring effort for OSU saw seven Beavers score, led by an 8-point quarter for Kat Tudor.</p>\n<p>Tudor was one of four Beavers to score in double figures on the night, posting 14 points for her team. Center Marie Gulich added 6 in the quarter as part of her 10-point night to go along with 6 boards.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara regrouped during halftime and was able to put together a 19-point third quarter effort. Sarah Porter, a redshirt junior, scored all of her 6 points in the third.</p>\n<p>Two made jumpers by Sahar and then a Sarah Porter three-ball got things rolling for the Gauchos and cut the Beaver lead to 18; however, OSU maintained its composure to keep Santa Barbara at bay.</p>\n<p>OSU guard Aleah Goodman scored 8 of her game-high 17 points in the quarter and the Beavers shot 60 percent from three to subdue Santa Barbara’s brief attempts at making runs. The quarter ended with the Beavers up 62-37 and hopes of a UCSB comeback minimal.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter saw both teams score 12 points, despite much of those baskets falling during garbage time. With the sound of the final buzzer, OSU held on to beat Santa Barbara 74-49.</p>\n<p>On the night, UCSB held its own in the paint, tying the Beavers for 26 points in the paint and only being outrebounded 34-33.</p>\n<p>An issue for the Gauchos was perhaps their poor shooting effort, going only 22-66 from the field, but also the fact that they failed to reach the free throw line.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara committed 19 personal fouls, OSU was only called for 3 fouls. The Beavers shot 52.9 percent overall and 56.3 percent from three-point territory in an efficient night finding the net.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss to the Beavers, the Gauchos will turn around to face Loyola Marymount at LMU on Monday.</p>\n<p>The game, which was rescheduled from its original date of December 7th due to conditions created by the Thomas Fire, will tip off at 7:00pm.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to get their second win of the season against a talented LMU team and use their experiences against top-25 teams in moving forward.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With their loss to USC, the Lions are polar opposite to the Gauchos, sitting at 7-1.</p>\n<p>Despite their 1-7 start, the Gauchos have found success when they run their offense as envisioned by Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson.</p>\n<p>Henrickson has aimed to orchestrate her team’s offense so that the ball moves through their star in the post, senior forward Drew Edelman. Edelman, while battling a few instances of injuries this year, is averaging team-highs in both points (14.4) and rebounds (8.3) per game.</p>\n<p>However, it seems Edelman is hoping to work her way back to the form she displayed last season when she led the Big West in field-goal percentage (61.4).</p>\n<p>Recently emerging to help Edelman in the scoring department has been redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter. Porter is averaging 10 points, 4.1 rebounds and two assists per game on the season.</p>\n<p>She has been living and dying by the three-ball this season, making 10 shots from beyond the arc in the team’s last three contests.</p>\n<p>However, she started the season only making threes in the first six games.</p>\n<p>Overall, Porter is shooting 30 percent from downtown and will hopefully start finding the net on a more consistent basis.</p>\n<p>In fact in her last three games, she has already shown to be more consistent, knocking down 10 of 25 deep balls.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have also shown glimpses of hot shooting, they should perhaps avoid getting into a high-scoring contest with LMU.</p>\n<p>UCSB this season is averaging 62.8 ppg, about 14 points less a game than the Lions who average nearly 76 points per contest.</p>\n<p>Contributing to its strong offensive presence were valuable performances made by a few talented players.</p>\n<p>Standing out for the Lions is junior Cheyanne Wallace, who is averaging a team-high 19.5 points along with grabbing 7.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Wallace was named the West Coast Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 27.</p>\n<p>Standing at 6’0” in a guard/forward position, Wallace posted 26 ppg and a little over eight boards per game during the week in which she earned the WCC honor.<br>\nShe will certainly be on the Santa Barbara coaching staff’s radar this week, as it will attempt to slow down one of LMU’s best offensive weapons.</p>\n<p>The difficulty for the Gauchos is that LMU has accompanying scoring options to supplement Wallace.</p>\n<p>The Lions have also been getting strong contributions from guard Gabby Green. The 6’2” redshirt junior is in the midst of her debut season at LMU, as she transferred from Berkeley after playing for the Golden Bears for two years.</p>\n<p>In her first year as a Lion, Green has been putting up well-rounded stat lines.</p>\n<p>Green is averaging 15.9 points to go with 6.4 boards and nearly four assists per game.</p>\n<p>Also, Green has so far blocked 10 shots and recorded 21 steals.</p>\n<p>The closest other Lion to these kinds of numbers is none other than Wallace, who has six blocks and 11 steals on the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will surely have their hands full Thursday night trying to contain LMU’s stars, but UCSB knows it has players who can find the net too such as Edelman and Porter.</p>\n<p>In last year’s meeting between Santa Barbara and the Lions, LMU took the close victory over the Gauchos by just two points, 57-55.</p>\n<p>The year before that loss, the Gauchos also came up short against LMU, so it is likely they will look to redeem themselves.</p>\n<p>Thursday night’s action will tip off at 7 p.m. against Loyola Marymount at the Thunderdome where the Gauchos will look to end their seven-game losing streak and earn their first home win.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Dec. 7, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80073\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80073\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/","id":203,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[202,201,200],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Remain Winless at Home, Fall to Fresno St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"Once again, the UCSB women's basketball team was haunted by its inconsistencies and suffered its sixth-straight loss Thursday night.

While the Gauchos used a variety of lineups to try to generate some offense, the Bulldogs used a hot start from freshman forward Maddi Utti to go up 20-7 with 1:14 left in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Utti scored 10 of her game-high 20 points in the first quarter. She ended up shooting 9-for-10 from the field and pulled down eight boards for the Bulldogs.</p>\n<p>As Fresno St. pressured the Gauchos much of the game using a full-court press, the Santa Barbara offense was disrupted.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Sarah Bates, who ended the game with 11 points, explained her team’s early struggles.</p>\n<p>“Honestly the pressure wasn’t that amazing. I freaked out with the ball sometimes and then once we got comfortable we realized there’s teams who play way better defense than that,” I said. “They’re not any better than we are, we’re just making mistakes. So it’s not necessarily the pressure it’s just us [needing to be] comfortable on offense, slowing down and making the right plays.”</p>\n<p>With roughly a minute to go, the Gauchos bounced back from their cold start as senior forward Chaya Durr knocked down two free throws to get things rolling. Then, sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez and senior guard Makala Roper hit two threes, Roper’s at the buzzer, to end the first period with an 8-0 run. UCSB found itself behind the Bulldogs 20-15.</p>\n<p>Despite managing to play from behind and cut the deficit, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson was unhappy with her team’s performance early, and stressed the importance of starting games with the right attitude.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to have a better start, obviously, and better energy, and better discipline on the defensive end. This team’s got to grow where they get some energy from the defensive end,” Henrickson said. “I think we get really excited when we make threes. I don’t think we get really excited from a stop. We’ve got to be more aggressive in the passing lanes, more aggressive on the ball.”</p>\n<p>With the second quarter underway, the Gauchos’ offensive struggles returned as they did not score until the 6:53 mark.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter came off the bench to drain two threes to tie the game at 23 apiece with 4:20 remaining. Porter, one of only three Gauchos in double digit scoring, contributed 12 points off the bench. The Bulldogs answered with a 9-3 run to close out the quarter, ending the half up 32-26.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos seemed to settle down during halftime, coming out with a more focused energy to start the third.</p>\n<p>After going down 40-31 with roughly four minutes to go, the Gauchos went on an 11-4 run to close out the quarter and cut the Bulldog lead to two. Santa Barbara used three pointers from Aliceah Hernandez, Sarah Porter and Sarah Bates plus a five-point quarter from Durr for its run. Durr scored a team-high 16 points and pulled down a team-high six boards.</p>\n<p>“We finally settled down. But there’s no reason for us to be down at home right away,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>Down 44-42 to start the fourth, Durr scored on a nice drive to the basket to tie the game at 44. Although the Gauchos shot below 40 percent from the free-throw line, beyond the arc and overall, they took their first lead of the night with 7:26 left in the game.</p>\n<p>Hernandez gave her team the lead off a made three-ball, but it would be Santa Barbara’s only lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs pulled ahead again with 5:21 remaining to take a 52-50. Santa Barbara’s defense had a hard time stopping Candice White and Maddi Utti in the final minutes. White and Utti scored eight and six in the period, respectively, to pull Fresno St. ahead 60-54 with 46 seconds to go. White, a junior guard, ended the game with 19 points and a game-high 11 boards.</p>\n<p>Following a UCSB timeout, Hernandez came off a screen to quickly drain a three, but with only 39 seconds left, the Gauchos were forced to foul.</p>\n<p>Up 60-57, the Bulldogs missed two free throws but got the ball back on a long rebound, forcing Santa Barbara to foul again. The Gauchos couldn’t get any other desperation threes to fall, losing the game by a final score of 64-57.</p>\n<p>After the game, Coach Henrickson addressed her team’s performance on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have everybody on the same page, right now, defensively,” she said. “I love our confidence, but our discipline is ridiculous. We’ve got to develop more discipline. We’ve got to play the right way, there’s a purpose to what we’re trying to do.”</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos losing their sixth straight, there are obvious improvements that need to be made so that Santa Barbara can play with more consistency rather than having to catch up.</p>\n<p>“We had a really good practice [Wednesday] so we’re waiting for this to transition from practice to consistency in a game,” Henrickson said. “Everybody’s disappointed, not discouraged. I still believe we’ve got a chance.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have a chance to bounce back when they visit No. 7 UCLA on Sunday, Dec. 3 at 1:30 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion.</p><div

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Following a loss to the University of San Diego Monday night at home, the UCSB women’s basketball team will have a few chances to get back to winning this week. Although the USD loss has pushed the Gauchos to 1-5 overall, they host Fresno St. at the Thunderdome Thursday night in hopes of redemption in front of a home crowd.</p>\n<p>Fresno St. seems to have entered a rut itself this season, having lost its last four games. The Bulldogs sit at 1-4 overall and will be aiming to get back on their feet when they visit Santa Barbara as part of their four-game road trip.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, turnovers and going cold in the fourth quarter have plagued them in recent games. In their tournament matchup against University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Gauchos committed 15 turnovers and scored only 6 points in the fourth quarter.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In their Monday night loss to USD, the Gauchos turned the ball over a staggering 24 times and managed to score only 8 points in the final ten minutes.</p>\n<p>From an outside perspective, it appears the Gauchos have the tools to start winning games if they can manage to cut their turnover numbers down. Santa Barbara has demonstrated that its offense is capable of winning games, posting 96 points in the early-season win over Northern Arizona University.</p>\n<p>The ability looks to be there for the Gauchos, it just seems to be an issue of consistency.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been working to improve defensively in practice this week, as Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson explained, “Today was about defensive positioning, communication and protecting the paint.”</p>\n<p>Henrickson stressed that defensive mentality isn’t a skill an entire team acquires from one day of work; rather it’s a learning process.</p>\n<p>“It sounds simple, but it’s not. Those habits don’t happen overnight so we’re not going to fix it overnight. Today I thought our effort was better,” Henrickson said. “and we were better communicators.”</p>\n<p>“The reason people win is on the defensive end, and how much you win by is your offense,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this defense-prioritization will get the Gauchos back on a winning track.</p>\n<p>In their last three contests, the Gauchos have failed to eclipse the 60-point mark but they have a more favorable matchup at home versus a similarly struggling Fresno St. team.</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs have so far averaged just under 60 points per game while allowing opponents to score just below 70. In last year’s matchup with the Bulldogs, UCSB beat the Bulldogs on a buzzer beater to secure the 50-49 victory.</p>\n<p>Fresno St. is currently averaging 15.2 turnovers per game while the Gauchos are averaging 16.7, so the matchup will surely be a test of each team’s ability to keep possession.</p>\n<p>Both the Gauchos and the Bulldogs will be looking to end their losing streaks Thursday night at 7:00 pm in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Win or lose to Fresno St. on Thursday night, UCSB will travel south to take on No. 7 UCLA for a Sunday afternoon game at Pauley Pavilion.</p>\n<p>UCLA has been rolling this season, standing at 5-1 with their only loss coming from a matchup with the No. 1 team in the country, UConn.</p>\n<p>The Bruins are set to host UC Riverside for a Tuesday night game in which the Bruins are favored. Last season, UCSB fell to UCLA at home by a 19-point deficit, so the Gauchos have a reason to look for the upset. While No. 7 UCLA is a team seeking a deep NCAA tournament run, the Gauchos have the talent to pull off the upset.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos get hot early from downtown, freeing up the post for Drew Edelman, it could make for a close game against one of the best teams in the country. Still, Santa Barbara will have to value possession since the Bruins will likely pressure the trio of freshman ball-handlers for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the Gauchos can pull off an upset Sunday, they will gain valuable experience from playing a top-tier UCLA team in a big-stage atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The action will tip off in Pauley Pavilion on Sunday at 1:30, as the Gauchos, look to knock off the No. 7 Bruins and get back to winning.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79980\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79980\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-29/amidst-5-game-slide-gauchos-aspire-to-get-back-on-track/","id":696,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[695,694,693],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Doesn’t Fare Well at the Saint Mary’s Tournament, Lost 4th Consecutive Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-4-17_11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_3-4-17_11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A trip to the Saint Mary's Tournament didn't end well for the UCSB women's basketball team as it endured its fourth-straight loss.

On Friday, the Gauchos lost by 30 points to Saint Mary’s 89-59. Then on Saturday, they fell to the University of Alabama at Birmingham 67-54.</p>\n<p>With these two recent losses, Santa Barbara now sits at 1-4 and is in the midst of a four-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Following their collapse at home against Seattle, the Gauchos had a week to prepare for the tournament in Moraga, California. Yet, Santa Barbara was outmatched by the host team in the opener as the Gaels of Saint Mary’s handed Santa Barbara its third consecutive loss, which was then followed by a defeat to UAB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>SAINT MARY’S Game</strong></p>\n<p>The afternoon game began with UCSB getting the ball stolen, allowing the Gaels to get on the board first 2-0. Overall, Saint Mary’s forced 16 total turnovers and converted those into 25 points. Including the opening steal, Saint Mary’s guard Stella Beck tallied 6 steals on the day. The senior also racked up 18 points off 6-9 shooting and recorded her 1000th career point against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held their only lead of the game after a Sarah Bates layup and a single Drew Edelman free throw made it 3-2 with 8:23 left in the first quarter. Edelman, a 6’4 redshirt senior, had another frustrating game, getting in foul trouble early and battling talented Saint Mary’s post players.</p>\n<p>Despite picking up two fouls in the first four minutes, Edelman contributed 10 points and a team-high 7 boards for the Gauchos. Saint Mary’s found much of their success down low, outscoring UCSB 52-16 in the paint and out-rebounding the Gauchos 42-32.</p>\n<p>A slow start for Santa Barbara forced head coach Bonnie Henrickson to take a 30-second timeout at the 4:52 mark. Out of the timeout, the Gaels went on to extend their 11-5 lead to 16-5. Santa Barbara finally got rolling thanks to sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Hernandez scored all of her 13 points in the first half, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Gaels, led by Sydney Raggio. The junior forward had 19 points and 9 rebounds, both game highs, and shot an efficient 8-13 from the field.</p>\n<p>The first quarter ended with the Gauchos making a bit of a run and the chance to cut the Gael lead to 3, but Chaya Durr’s layup attempt was blocked with just one second remaining. Saint Mary’s led after 10 minutes of play 22-17.</p>\n<p>After the somewhat hopeful end of the first quarter for UCSB, the Gauchos went on to shoot only 23.1 percent from the field in the second quarter. Saint Mary’s used big plays from Raggio and Beck to outscore the Gauchos 21-14 in the quarter.</p>\n<p>At the 6:25 mark, center Natalia Bruening made a pair of free throws to put Santa Barbara within 4, down only 25-29. But, the Gaels proceeded to go on a 10-0 run to lead the Gauchos 39-25 with 3:26 remaining. UCSB used a pair of threes from Sarah Bates and Tal Sahar to end their scoring drought, but the Gauchos remained behind 43-31 at the end of the half.</p>\n<p>The third quarter of play saw UCSB’s struggles continue, turning the ball over 5 times and only scoring 16 points while allowing 26. Edelman scored 8 of her 10 in the quarter, but Akilah Jennings and Danae Miller were the only other Gauchos to score, each contributing 4 points. Saint Mary’s extended their lead using an array of scoring to go up 69-47 heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Down by 22, a Santa Barbara comeback seemed unlikely. The Gaels’ reserves held UCSB to only 12 points in the final quarter and an abysmal 16.7 percent shooting. At the final buzzer, UCSB was defeated by Saint Mary’s 89-59. The 30-point margin is Santa Barbara’s largest deficit of the season.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB shot 30.5 percent from the field and 28.6 percent from three. The Gaels, on the other hand, shot above an impressive 50 percent in both categories. With the win against the Gauchos and then a fourth straight win recorded against Indiana, the Gaels won their own tournament and sit at 4-1 overall.</p>\n<p><strong>UAB Game</strong></p>\n<p>Luckily for the Gauchos, they had a chance to turn around the next day and compete. Facing the University of Alabama at Birmingham on Saturday, Santa Barbara looked to bring a bit more energy to the court.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game with a three-ball from junior guard Akilah Jennings, one of her four threes in the game. Jennings, in her first season at UCSB, scored a team-high 14 points and shot 4-8 from three-point range. Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, Jennings was the only Gaucho to score in double figures versus the Blazers.</p>\n<p>Using a pair of threes from Aliceah Hernandez in addition to a three from Nina Radford, Santa Barbara spread the floor early. UAB was held to 4-17 shooting in the quarter, with big buckets coming from junior Deanna Kuzmanic, who scored 5 of her game-high 24 points in the first. At the end of the first, the Gauchos led the Blazers 16-10, holding UAB scoreless in the final 4:53.</p>\n<p>Although the Blazers got off to a rough start, they bounced back in the second quarter. Following a UCSB three-pointer by Danae Miller, the Blazers fired back with a 24-9 run to end the half. Kuzmanic and fellow Blazer Miyah Barnes were instrumental in the UAB run, with the sophomore Barnes scoring 8 of her 17 in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Fellow Blazer Angela Vendrell got in on the fun as well, scoring 6 points in the quarter. Vendrell, a sophomore from Spain, ended the game with 8 points and a game-high 12 boards. The huge quarter for UAB put the Blazers up 34-28 at the end of the half.</p>\n<p>Down six at the start of the second half, UCSB used a 20-point third quarter in able to tie the Blazers at 48 heading into the fourth. A pair of free throws from Radford and two more threes by Jennings to open the quarter tied the game at 36 with 6:41 to go.</p>\n<p>Jennings scored 8 points in the quarter and Santa Barbara post-players Edelman and Bruening added four points each. From there, UAB and Santa Barbara traded baskets on efficient shooting. Each team shot above 50 percent in the third to set the stage for a decisive final quarter.</p>\n<p>The final 10 minutes began with the Blazers going on a 13-0 run. A close game just minutes before, UCSB found itself down 48-61 with 5:52 left in the game. Out of gas, the Gauchos couldn’t rally a comeback.  On 20 percent overall and 12.5 percent from three-point range, the Gauchos managed to only score 6 points in the final quarter. Sarah Porter ended the drought with a layup and-one to make it 51-61 at the 5:30 mark. The only other scoring for UCSB came from an Akilah Jennings three with just 56 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>The Blazers dominated the fourth quarter to come away with the 67-54 win. Kuzmanic outscored the Gauchos herself in the fourth, scoring 9 of her 24 in the final quarter. UCSB’s persistent turnover issue remained, as the Gauchos turned the ball over 15 times.</p>\n<p>With the win, UAB moves to 4-1 overall while handing the Gauchos their fourth straight loss and first winless tournament since the 1992-93 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/","id":675,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[674,673,672],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Stuck in a Rut, Hope to End 4-Game Losing Streak vs USD","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is in hopes of getting back on the winning side of things.

The Gauchos have plenty of talent on both ends of the court, so it seems just a matter of time before head coach Bonnie Henrickson and her staff put the pieces together.

Averaging just over 15 turnovers per game, UCSB will need to cut down on a variety of mistakes costing them possessions.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are featuring three freshmen guards this season in Sarah Bates, Danae Miller and Cece Quintino, the turnovers cannot simply be attributed to the freshmen.</p>\n<p>Drew Edelman is averaging 2.6 turnovers per game and although she is also averaging roughly 16 points per contest, the talented forward has had ample opportunities to dominate the paint. With just a few more shots falling for the 6’4 Edelman, Santa Barbara’s offense will run more smoothly and surely take pressure off of the freshmen ball-handlers.</p>\n<p>UCSB-USD will tip-off at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/gauchos-stuck-in-a-rut-hope-to-end-4-game-losing-streak-vs-usd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/gauchos-stuck-in-a-rut-hope-to-end-4-game-losing-streak-vs-usd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/gauchos-stuck-in-a-rut-hope-to-end-4-game-losing-streak-vs-usd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/gauchos-stuck-in-a-rut-hope-to-end-4-game-losing-streak-vs-usd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/gauchos-stuck-in-a-rut-hope-to-end-4-game-losing-streak-vs-usd/","id":681,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[680,679,678],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Squander 21-point Lead at Home, Fall to Seattle","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"It was a rough ending for the UCSB women's basketball team as the Gauchos fell to Seattle University in their home opener.

We’ll get it figured out, you know we will, it’s just frustrating in the process.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After starting the season with a win, UCSB is now 1-2 overall, having suffered losses to Santa Clara and now Seattle.</p>\n<p>While Seattle played its first two games at home, they fell to Idaho State and Hawaii. The Redhawks earned their first win of the season against Santa Barbara, so they sit at 1-2 as well.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior Drew Edelman led Santa Barbara with 16 points and 19 rebounds. Senior forward Chaya Durr added 12 points and eight boards while fellow redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter added 13 and seven boards. Freshman guard Sarah Bates contributed 11 points while freshman guard Danae Miller recorded a team-high four assists.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a rough night finding the net, shooting 39.4 percent from the field and just 28.6 percent from beyond the arc. Tal Sahar, the redshirt sophomore who played for Seattle two years ago, only played five minutes, going 0-3 with one steal.</p>\n<p>Seattle was led by Alexis Montgomery, a redshirt senior, who ended the game with 20 points and 12 rebounds. Sophomore guard Kamira Sanders contributed a bit of everything for the Redhawks, scoring 21 points to go along with 9 boards, 6 assists and 4 steals.</p>\n<p>On the night, Seattle actually shot better from beyond the arc than overall. Converting on 10-24 threes and 27-65 shots overall, the Redhawks shot 41.7 and 41.5 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Both teams appeared evenly matched in the first quarter, with the quarter ending 14-14.</p>\n<p>After a back and forth first quarter, which was hardly impressive for either team, Santa Barbara went on a run in the second to take a 23-18 lead and forced a Seattle timeout with 5:46 remaining.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, the Gauchos maintained their momentum. Porter contributed 10 of her 13 points in the second quarter. With the Redhawks shooting only 25 percent from the field in the quarter, the Gauchos were able to end the half with a slight edge at a 36-24 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB opened the second half with energy and looked to be in control.</p>\n<p>With 5:39 to go in the third, the Gauchos used a Bates three to go up 51-30, leading by their largest margin of the game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, it gave up a 15-9 Seattle run to end the quarter. The Redhawks used big scoring from Montgomery and a handful of three-pointers for their 21-point quarter. While Seattle remained down 15 heading into the fourth, Santa Barbara appeared to have gotten too comfortable with its lead.</p>\n<p>In the final quarter, Seattle made a huge comeback, shocking the home crowd.</p>\n<p>Seattle held the Gauchos to an abysmal 5-for-20 shooting and only 1-for-6 performance from beyond the arc in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Freshmen guards Cece Quintino, Bates and Miller each faced heavy pressure from the Seattle defense, led primarily by the pestering defense of McKenzie Williams. Williams seemed to have the young guards’ numbers in the fourth, making it a hard task for Santa Barbara to simply get the ball across half court at times.</p>\n<p>The Redhawks finally got their offense rolling in the fourth, using a big quarter from Kamira Sanders. Sanders had 13 points on 5-for-5 shooting to go with 6 rebounds, 2 assists and a steal in the fourth quarter alone.</p>\n<p>Shooting 62.5 percent from three helped the Redhawks overcome the deficit, making 5-of-8 shots from beyond the arc. Fans watched in disbelief as the Gauchos squandered their 21-point lead and Seattle came storming back. While the Gauchos were held to 11 points in the quarter, Seattle put up 32.</p>\n<p>After a few back and forth possessions of Seattle chipping away at Santa Barbara’s lead, it looked like UCSB had a chance to regain its composure.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos brought the ball up the floor with 2:56 remaining, up 71-70. Santa Barbara got the ball inside to Edelman on a nice feed that gave the forward a clean look, but the 6’4 forward could not convert.</p>\n<p>Frustration seemed to kick in for the Gauchos, as missed shots and an unanswered 7-0 run by Seattle pushed Santa Barbara into desperation mode. The Gauchos ended the game with three possessions each ending in badly-missed three-point shots, and Seattle made enough of its free-throws to close out the game.</p>\n<p>Scoreless in the final 2:56, the Gauchos fell to the Redhawks 77-71.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, it will have a week break to perhaps solidify its defense and work on running its offense the way Coach Henrickson wants. UCSB will travel to Moraga, CA for the Saint Mary’s Tournament, which will begin this Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/","id":218,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[217,216,215],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball to Host Seattle in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A return home may be just what the UCSB women's basketball team needs following it loss Tuesday night.

The Redhawks recorded a 58-53 victory over the Gauchos last season.</p>\n<p>An interesting aspect of Friday’s matchup between Santa Barbara and Seattle is that redshirt sophomore Tal Sahar used to play for Seattle prior to transferring to UCSB last season.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Redhawks, Sahar averaged 10.2 points as a freshman while also shooting 38 percent from a three-point range.<br>\nSahar, who sat out last year due to NCAA transfer rules, has brought the Gauchos an increased shooting ability and length on the perimeter.</p>\n<p>In spite of the intangibles she possesses, Sahar hasn’t had much of an impact in the team’s two games.</p>\n<p>She has yet to score a point and has gone 0-for-3 from the field and 0-2 from behind the three-point line in each contest.</p>\n<p>While Sahar has slowed down considerably in terms of production following 14 points in her debut in the Gauchos’ exhibition win over CSU East Bay, the 5’11” guard is understandably getting accustomed after not playing a single game last season.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Sahar will get into more of a rhythm facing her old team.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, its turnover woes have continued.</p>\n<p>While it is early in the season and the team will likely tighten up its offense as it develops more chemistry, the Gauchos turned the ball over 21 times Tuesday night against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>Many of these turnovers can be attributed to Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson’s decision to start two true freshmen, Danae Miller and Sarah Bates, and Santa Clara managed to take advantage of the young guards’ inexperience at the collegiate level.</p>\n<p>While redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman scored a game-high 23 points on 50 percent shooting, the Gauchos will need to get more contributions from their role players if they wish to win games this season.</p>\n<p>One player the Gauchos are hoping will emerge soon is redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>In the team’s first two games, she shot a combined 8-for-19 from the field and has really been missed from beyond the arc, where she has gone 4-for-12. Notably, after playing 32 minutes in UCSB’s season opener, Porter only played 15 minutes in the team’s loss to Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>No other Gaucho reached double-digit scoring versus Santa Clara, allowing defenses to focus primarily on containing Edelman in the post.</p>\n<p>UCSB definitely has the talent to disrupt defenses, with plenty of shooting ability, but perhaps Henrickson will have to stress ball movement to find open shots on kick-outs from Edelman.<br>\nSanta Barbara has so far shot 45.7 percent from downtown this season, so it seems it will only be a matter of getting more opportunities from three-point land in order to generate offense.</p>\n<p>Facing Seattle may be the remedy the Gauchos are looking for, as the Redhawks have allowed opponents to score at least 73 points in both of their losses.</p>\n<p>Seattle is coming off a season in which it went 15-18 overall and 10-4 in Western Athletic Conference (WAC) play.</p>\n<p>The Redhawks finished tied for second in the WAC and made it to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament, where they lost their first-round game to Wyoming.</p>\n<p>In her second season, Seattle Head Coach Suzy Barcomb is looking to improve even in the face of losing three of her starters from last season.</p>\n<p>Barcomb seems to have the experience and knowledge to make her capable of leading this year’s Seattle team back into postseason play.<br>\nIn her total 18 seasons of coaching, Barcomb has a win percentage of .640, holding a record of 320-180 overall.</p>\n<p>Increasing the likelihood of sustaining such success definitely becomes more plausible with a player like Alexis Montgomery.</p>\n<p>The redshirt senior two-guard is currently the team’s leading scorer at 23.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Also making an impact is the reigning WAC Freshman of the Year recipient, sophomore guard Kamira Sanders, whose 13.5 PPG ranks second on the team.<br>\nFriday’s home opener will tip off at 7 p.m. on Nov. 17 at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 16, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The sophomore guard made 5-of-7 attempts from beyond the arc, racking up 15 points.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game up aggressively, leading 27-21 at the end of the first quarter; however, the Lumberjacks found a way to turn things around before halftime. NAU’s ability to out-rebound the Gauchos 43-38, al while forcing 11 total turnovers were instrumental parts of its effort to stay in the game.</p>\n<p>Additionally, big performances from Lumberjacks Olivia Lucero and Kenna McDavis powered Northern Arizona’s big offensive night. The duo of redshirt seniors combined for 47 points, with Lucero pouring on a game-high 26 to go along with a game-high 11 assists.</p>\n<p>McDavis, a forward, went to work on the glass, grabbing a game-high 13 boards. UCSB scored 18 points in the quarter. With the momentum shifting, the Lumberjacks led 47-45.</p>\n<p>After the break, Santa Barbara regained its composure, stepping it up offensively by utilizing its skilled forward in the paint. The Gauchos fed Edelman in the third quarter, allowing the redshirt senior to score nine in the period as part of a 30-point quarter to regain the lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s bench outscored the Lumberjack second rotation 26-14, fueling a comeback of sorts after the lackluster second quarter. With Norther Arizona also having a strong offensive quarter, the 30-point quarter for Santa Barbara only gave the Gauchos a 75-72 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos demonstrated great composure down the stretch Friday, never trailing in the final quarter to the persistent Lumberjacks. Using a clutch three-pointer from Hernandez and free-throws from Bates, the Gauchos held on to win 96-93.</p>\n<p>Despite the win, Santa Barbara got beat in the paint Friday, being outrebounded as mentioned and outscored in the paint 44-36. Notably, UCSB only forced five turnovers and failed to convert any of those turnovers into buckets while the Lumberjacks scored 14 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>While there’s obviously a learning curve one game into the season, it seems the Gauchos have all the pieces for success this year. Some tweaks on defense will need to be made, but the team’s mix of returnees and newcomers such as Bates makes UCSB a tough team to gameplan against.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79658\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79658\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/","id":655,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[654,653,652],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/43"}},"__N_SSG":true}
