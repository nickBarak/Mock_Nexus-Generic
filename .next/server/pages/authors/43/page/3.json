She gives us added weapons from the three-point line,” Henrickson said. “Tal’s big enough, long enough to play a four and defend a four, so it gives us some size on the glass, too. And that’s what we need our big wings to do; they’ve got to rebound the ball better.”</p>\n<p>The Coach Bonnie era is in full swing for Santa Barbara; however, for Northern Arizona, their new era has just begun, starting with the signing of a new head coach, Loree Payne.</p>\n<p>Payne previously led a successful seven-year coaching campaign at Puget Sound that saw her winning just under 70 percent of games in both conference and regular-season play.</p>\n<p>The Lumberjacks under Payne are looking to move in a new direction, having 10 newcomers to the team. The rebuilding effort of Northern Arizona will be a process, as the Lumberjacks finished with just six wins last season.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup will feature plenty of newcomers from both teams, as well as ambitious coaches in Henrickson and Payne looking to guide their programs to an opening win.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on NAU on Friday, Nov. 10, with tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 9, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79608\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79608\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/","id":603,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[602,601,600],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set Tone in Exhibition Win Over CSU East Bay","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wbb.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wbb.png?resize=707%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Eager to show off their new additions, the UCSB women's basketball team rolled over Cal State East Bay in its exhibition opener, 78-63.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team defeated Cal State East Bay in its exhibition opener Saturday night by a final score of 78-63.</p>\n<p>Although third-year Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson didn’t have a some of her more experienced players due to various minor injuries, a small-ball lineup featuring three freshmen brought the Gauchos energy and an array of scoring early in the game.</p>\n<p>“Good thing it was fun,” Henrickson said. “We did some good things, [there are] plenty of opportunities to grow and learn on film.

Their hot start would prove to be just that, as the Gauchos finished shooting 45.2 percent (28-62) on the night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scoring presence also came from the three-point line, as Bates herself knocked down two threes and newcomer Tal Sahar hit four threes as part of her promising 14-point debut for UCSB. Ultimately, Santa Barbara put up 27 three-point attempts, converting on 10 to go 37 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“It felt really good, it was really nerve-wracking, you don’t play for 365 days you don’t really know how it’s going to go”, Tal explained, “But it felt really good and everyone worked really hard in practice [so] the pace didn’t really phase me as much as I thought it would.”</p>\n<p>Sahar, who sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules, showed confidence on both ends of the court and the ability to create her own shot off the dribble. Also, the 5’11 redshirt sophomore will clearly be a perimeter threat to opposing teams, forcing them to respect Sahar’s range.</p>\n<p>And when the Pioneers caught on to Sahar’s ability to easily knock down the three, the athletic guard showed a high basketball IQ in avoiding pressure, swinging the ball to get the easy bucket.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter contributed seven points on an off-night shooting, going just 2-8 and 1-6 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Senior Makala Roper used an energetic stretch in the latter part of the game to score a quick 12 points for her team.</p>\n<p>Akilah Jennings finished with 13 points and 6 boards for Santa Barbara, and fellow Gauchos Radford and Chaya Durr added a handful of buckets.</p>\n<p>Durr, a 6-foot forward, did a little bit of everything for the Gauchos, recording a team-high seven rebounds in addition to 8 points and 3 steals. The senior brought a competitive attitude and posted her diverse stat-line in only 20 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Despite a slow first half in which they only scored 22 points, the East Bay Pioneers used a game-high 25 point performance from sophomore Morgan Greene to get their offense rolling in the second half.</p>\n<p>Outscoring Santa Barbara 41-38 in the second half, East Bay controlled the boards during stretches, earning 15 points off second-chance efforts.</p>\n<p>Greene led the Pioneers with not only points but rebounds, pulling down a game-high 14 boards (6 of which were offensive).</p>\n<p>East Bay’s strong second half kept the Gauchos on their toes, but it wasn’t enough to pull off an upset, as the garbage time of the fourth quarter featured an array of bad passes, missed layups and simple turnovers from both teams.</p>\n<p>The game concluded with UCSB dribbling out the clock, and the Pioneers falling to the Gauchos in the Thunderdome. East Bay shot roughly 35 percent (23-66) from the field to go with a sub-par 26.3 percent (5-19) shooting effort from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“There’s a maturity about them, they come to work every day with a maturity and sense of urgency,” Henrickson said. “They’re silly and goofy off [the court], but when we’re between the lines they want to get it right, they want to be good, they expect to be successful, they expect to work to be successful. I think for us to play a pretty good flow and rhythm, considering so many new people… that was good.”</p>\n<p>Following the game, Coach Bonnie, Sahar, and Jennings addressed an excited group in the Founder’s Room of the Thunderdome, pointing to the revived culture of basketball Henrickson has brought to Santa Barbara in her 3rd year at the helm of the program.</p>\n<p>With plenty of energy and expectations surrounding them this year, the Gauchos will travel to open their season against Northern Arizona this Friday, November 10 at 7:00 pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79535\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79535\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/","id":598,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[597,596,595],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Host Senior Day Match Against No. 5 Pacific in Hopes of Capturing 1st Conf.

That can largely be attributed to the strange way UCSB suddenly went into a slump.</p>\n<p>Without two of their best players in sophomore utility Ivan Gvozdanovic and junior driver Boris Jovanovic, the Gauchos have had to make considerable adjustments offensively and defensively.</p>\n<p>In response, the young Santa Barbara roster has been forced into action, which has definitely shown throughout their five-game slide, but the Gauchos have impressed their coaching staff in showing resilience as well as improvement.</p>\n<p>Although they lost a close match against Irvine in their last game, the Gauchos’ energy seemed to have returned, as they put together a comeback effort and rallied behind senior attacker Shane Hauschild.</p>\n<p>On the season, Hauschild has been one of the only bright spots, especially as of late, leading the team in almost all categories: steals (25), goals (28), points (42) and assists (14).</p>\n<p>Even though Hauschild recorded five total goals against Irvine, he can’t be expected to put up the same numbers against a better Pacific team, at least not without more help from his teammates.</p>\n<p>Granted, the sudden absence of Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic, two relied-on scorers, would throw a wrench into any program’s game plan, but the Gauchos have the weapons capable of making up for the lost production.</p>\n<p>Freshmen attackers Cole Brosnan and Jesse Morrison, in addition to redshirt freshman Adam Lott, have been part of the young supporting cast for the Gauchos, but they will still have to find a way to contribute more in order to take on the Tigers.</p>\n<p>With the Serbian duo out, senior utility Reed Cotterill has shown glimpses of last season, during which he was selected to the GCC All-Tournament Team.</p>\n<p>Cotterill, coming from Australia, likely has more of a green light in terms of looking to score if the Gauchos remain without their two former goal-leaders.</p>\n<p>An obstacle for UCSB this season has been a difficult schedule, but the Gauchos are familiar with playing the top programs in the country on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>Despite their recent struggles, the Gauchos can find hope in the fact that Pepperdine last year ended up winning the GCC tournament while doing poorly during the season.</p>\n<p>If Hauschild and Cotterill bring the same energy to the pool that they brought against Irvine, the young supporting cast of Gauchos will likely be able to rally around their talented seniors and should, in turn, have a shot at the upset.</p>\n<p>Cotterill, specifically, will aim to take some of the load off Hauschild early on, as the Tigers will likely prepare to stop the man who had a hat trick within the first quarter last game.</p>\n<p>Pacific, coming off a close loss on the road against UCLA, will look to regroup before playing Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The UCSB coaching staff will have a difficult time preparing to stop the Tigers, as the Tigers’ offense is decently dispersed through a handful of scorers.</p>\n<p>In just three conference games, the Tigers have put up 37 total goals from nine different players, whereas the Gauchos have scored just 21 goals during the same number of conference games.</p>\n<p>A standout for Pacific, in particular, is redshirt sophomore Luke Pavillard. The Australian native has scored 52 goals overall on the season while also contributing 24 assists.</p>\n<p>Pacific showed in its most recent game that it can score rapidly and sporadically, as the Tigers posted a 6-1 fourth quarter in a comeback effort that would ultimately fall short against the Bruins. While Pacific will clearly want to utilize its offensive power, UCSB will have to do its best to contain any rapid scoring by the Tigers.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will probably turn to a slower, more methodical game relying on key defensive stops in order to match up with the No. 5 team in the nation.</p>\n<p>The action will begin at Campus Pool on Friday, Nov. 3, at 7 p.m. at the No. 10 Gauchos look to get their first conference win of the season over the No. 5 University of Pacific.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 2nd, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Both sides had troubles finding the net for the better half of the quarter, but UCI finally scored off of Antoine Lena’s finish off a lob.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79024\" style=\"width: 276px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/menswaterpolo_christinademarzo_10-5-17_3-web/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79024\" data-attachment-id=\"79024\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-furious-comeback-falls-short-still-winless-in-conference-play-following-loss/menswaterpolo_christinademarzo_10-5-17_3-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_3-web.jpg?fit=1356%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1356,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_3-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_3-web.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_3-web.jpg?fit=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79024\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_3-web-678x1024.jpg?resize=266%2C402\" alt=\"\" width=\"266\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_3-web.jpg?resize=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_3-web.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_3-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1160&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_3-web.jpg?w=1356&amp;ssl=1 1356w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79024\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shane Hauschild throws the ball, attempting to score a point. <em>Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With the game tied 3-3 with 3:50 remaining in the first half, the Anteaters didn’t slow down.</p>\n<p>With 2:32 remaining, Irvine scored again from a lob, this time Jon Polos finishing the play to give the road team the 4-3 lead. Jack Trush, Kyle Trush’s brother, scored for UCI with 1:56 to go, burying the Gauchos 5-3 for the first half of play.</p>\n<p>To start the second half, tensions rose after a few controversial calls and non-calls. This would show throughout the second half, as players would be ubiquitously tangled up with each other as they moved down the pool.</p>\n<p>At 6:21 in the quarter, Hauschild scored his fourth goal of the day with another strong shot from the top of the key to put the Gauchos within a goal. The Santa Barbara native seemed to be proving something during Friday’s contest, perhaps having his best game of the year but even more importantly driving the Gauchos’ attitude.</p>\n<p>With just under four minutes remaining, Kyle Trush added a goal for the Anteaters, giving them the advantage 6-4. Irvine’s scoring would continue to come in bunches, with the freshman Schuetze scoring at 2:11 to put the Anteaters up 7-4.</p>\n<p>Then, with 1:50 to go, Adam Lott scored off an assist from Hauschild to make it 7-5.</p>\n<p>Following an odd series of calls from the referees, Irvine’s Jack Trush was able to score with 21 seconds left. With the clock winding down, UCSB’s Cole Brosnan got the ball and made a nice move to score at the buzzer.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final 8 minutes, Irvine held an 8-6 advantage. A goal by sophomore attacker Jacob Halle at 5:52 in the quarter made it 8-7. Following Halle’s goal, the game featured minutes of rough fouls and the crowd giving the referees some advice and it looked like the chaos was helping neither side.</p>\n<p>Finally, at 2:40 to go, Kyle Trush converted to give the Anteaters the 9-7 lead.</p>\n<p>A penalty shot from Shane Hauschild with 2:16 left gave Hauschild his 5th goal of the day and moved the Gauchos within one.</p>\n<p>With 1:22 remaining and only down one, Reed Cotterill finessed an over the shoulder shot from set to tie the game 9-9. The senior added the exclamation point by facing the crowd and pumping his fist, giving the Gauchos momentum and a comeback hope.</p>\n<p>A focused defensive stand by UCSB ended in a deflating goal by Irvine’s Lovre Milos to give the Anteaters the 10-9 lead with 34 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t come up with a tying goal in their last possession, giving Irvine the victory.</p>\n<p>Justyn Barrios had another big day in the cage, despite being scored on ten times, as he had 11 saves. A few of those saves were one-on-one with an opposing player when the sophomore goalkeeper came up huge for the Gauchos in preventing the score from getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>For a young UCSB team that’s still without two of its best players, the loss can’t be too much of a surprise or even a deterrent. Last year’s Gold Coast Conference championship was won by Pepperdine, a 4th seed in the tournament, so the Gauchos have opportunities remaining.</p>\n<p>“We know there are hard games down the stretch, and I think this game showed any of these games you can come in and win. Whether we win or lose these games, we just want to be playing well,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said, “I thought we played well.”</p>\n<p>Although it still has a chance for postseason glory, this is the UCSB team that has now lost 5 straight. With or without their two better players of Ivan Gvozdanovic and Boris Jovanovic, the Gauchos will have to make some quick adjustments.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos haven’t been too far off, as they’ve shown signs of dominance earlier in the season. UCSB has a considerably young roster and so obviously the consistency that comes with a mature team hasn’t been prominent late in the season, but Friday’s tightly-contested matchup with Irvine showed promise for UCSB’s developing players.</p>\n<p>“We fought back a couple times and I was really proud of the effort of the guys,” Wigo noted, “a lot of the younger guys played some great minutes.”</p>\n<p>They’ll just have to channel that energy and follow the leadership of Shane Hauschild as they prepare to play their final games of the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s penultimate match will be at 7 p.m. on Friday, November 3 against Pacific at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79365\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-furious-comeback-falls-short-still-winless-in-conference-play-following-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79365\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-furious-comeback-falls-short-still-winless-in-conference-play-following-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-furious-comeback-falls-short-still-winless-in-conference-play-following-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-furious-comeback-falls-short-still-winless-in-conference-play-following-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-furious-comeback-falls-short-still-winless-in-conference-play-following-loss/","id":4887,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[4886,4885,4884],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 10 UCSB Seeking First GCC Win of the Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_10-web-e1540254586290.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_10-web-e1540254586290.jpg?resize=900%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Despite not having two-star athletes, the UCSB men's water polo team will hope to end its three-game losing streak against UC Irvine this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Currently, on a four-match losing streak, the No. 10 UCSB men’s water polo team will look to end its latest slump this Friday at home.

Sophomore Justyn Barrios is fourth in the GCC in saves with 100 on the season.</p>\n<p>An interesting development for the Gauchos this season has been the absence of stars Ivan Gvozdanovic and Boris Jovanovic. The Serbian duo had accounted for over a quarter of UCSB’s points and roughly 27 percent of Santa Barbara’s goals (as of Oct. 9).</p>\n<p>Without Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic, the Gauchos have understandably struggled to muster enough offense to take down opponents. In the last game that the Serbian duo played in, Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic scored a combined four goals, but the Gauchos haven’t won a game without them since.</p>\n<p>The absence couldn’t come at a worse time, either, as Santa Barbara had to face No. 1 USC and then go on the road for three more competitive games against some of the nation’s top programs. Although the absence of two of its best players provides some leeway for the team’s recent decline, it appears that if UCSB remains without Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic, it will have a rough end to the season. Friday’s game against the Anteaters should provide concrete insight regarding the expectations the team could potentially meet as things begin to conclude.</p>\n<p>“It’s not fun when some of your best players aren’t playing,” Wigo said, “but it gives a chance for other players to rise up.”</p>\n<p>Because the end of the season is near, the outcome of Friday’s game against the Anteaters will likely indicate the Gauchos’ fate this year. If Santa Barbara loses, the Gauchos will be 0-3 in the GCC and below .500 overall all while losing 5 games in a row. This isn’t an ideal situation for any team at the end of the season, especially a team whose two players accounting for a quarter of UCSB goals this year have been absent.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, since the Gauchos have already beaten the Anteaters once this year, they’ll be able to use that experience to their advantage. If the Gauchos pull off the upset, they will at least snap their losing streak and be above .500 overall. This game might be a turning point for UCSB, as it could return home from a hard road trip and get a win going into the final games of the season with momentum.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to end their losing streak when they face off against UC Irvine on Friday, Oct. 27 at 3 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Oct. 26, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79325\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/no-10-ucsb-seeking-first-gcc-win-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79325\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/no-10-ucsb-seeking-first-gcc-win-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/no-10-ucsb-seeking-first-gcc-win-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/no-10-ucsb-seeking-first-gcc-win-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/no-10-ucsb-seeking-first-gcc-win-of-the-year/","id":4914,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[4913,4912,4911],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Road Woes Continue for No. 10 UCSB After Falling to No. 8 Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara's winning drought continues following its road loss to No. 8 LBSU.

Senior Shane Hauschild had a hat trick and freshman Cole Brosnan, redshirt freshman Adam Lott and freshman Chad Nelson each added a goal for UCSB.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Long Beach junior defender Austin Stevenson recorded a hat trick of his own to match Haushchild’s.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have failed to score more than six goals in each of their last four games. Before this most recent slide, the Gauchos had only been held to under six goals in their match against UCLA earlier this season.</p>\n<p>While allowing 10 goals on the night, sophomore goalkeeper Justyn Barrios still managed to have an impressive outing with 10 saves.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to end their four-game losing streak in their final three matches of the season.

The 49ers are .500 overall, holding a 9-9 record.</p>\n<p>While the 49ers are hosting UCSD on Wednesday and could get a win, they are currently on a worse losing streak than the Gauchos, as they have lost their last five games.</p>\n<p>A concern for Friday’s game will be whether sophomore utility Ivan Gvozdanovic and junior driver Boris Jovanovic will be back in the action.<br>\nGvozdanovic and Jovanovic are the leading scorers for the Gauchos, and, combined with senior attacker Shane Hauschild, produce nearly a third of UCSB goals.</p>\n<p>Obviously, there’s a lot riding on the return of both Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have struggled offensively the past few games due to the lack of Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic, sophomore goalkeeper Justyn Barrios has been a point of consistency.</p>\n<p>Although he’s been scored on, Barrios doesn’t get discouraged, recording 12 saves versus USC and nine more against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos’ scoring duo isn’t there to help the Gauchos Friday, Barrios will again have to step into the very important role of damage control.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have done fairly well at evenly spreading their scoring this season, with their top five scorers all shooting above .400.</p>\n<p>The goal-leader for Long Beach is Austin Stewart, who has scored 31 goals off of 69 shots. In comparison, only two of UCSB’s top five scorers this season are shooting over .400 (as of stats last updated Oct. 9).</p>\n<p>The 49ers player with the second most goals on the year is sophomore attacker Nemanja Bakic.</p>\n<p>Bakic scored two goals against No. 2 UCLA and has totaled 26 goals off 55 shots.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the Gauchos will have their hands full on defense, especially if they don’t get a much-needed offensive boost from Gvozdanovic and Jovanovic.</p>\n<p>Either way, one team will come out of the game with their losing streak broken, while the loser will be left quite far behind, as both the Gauchos and 49ers are already in second-to-last and last place respectively in the Golden Coast Conference.</p>\n<p>This will be the final opportunity of this road trip for Santa Barbara to get a win. The Gauchos return home to Campus Pool next Friday, Oct. 27, against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face off against Long Beach State Friday, Oct. 20, at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Oct. 19, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79175\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/mens-water-polo-concludes-3-match-road-trip-at-conference-foe-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79175\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/mens-water-polo-concludes-3-match-road-trip-at-conference-foe-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/mens-water-polo-concludes-3-match-road-trip-at-conference-foe-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/mens-water-polo-concludes-3-match-road-trip-at-conference-foe-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/mens-water-polo-concludes-3-match-road-trip-at-conference-foe-lbsu/","id":4908,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[4907,4906,4905],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Upended by SJSU and Stanford Over the Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-5-17_7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos came up short with back-to-back losses against San Jose State and Stanford.

UCSB then continued to hold the Spartans scoreless until the second quarter.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos beginning the second quarter with a goal from sophomore attacker Brannan Haket, it looked as if UCSB was in control. However, the Spartans then went on to score three consecutive goals. San Jose St. held UCSB at two goals, resulting in a 3-2 score at halftime in the favor of the Spartans.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter, after falling behind 4-2 off another Spartan goal, Shane Hauschild found the back of the net to make it 4-3. Shane’s brother Ben, then showed Shane up by scoring two goals of his own to make the game 6-3 entering the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>It was too little too late for the Gauchos in the fourth quarter, but they did manage to hold the Spartans to a single fourth quarter goal while scoring three goals of their own. The Gauchos final scoring effort came from Brannan Haket’s second goal of the night, as well as goals from Spencer Wood and Jesse Morrison.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ comeback was halted by the sound of the final buzzer, ending the game 7-6. Despite giving up seven goals, Justyn Barrios still had an impressive night with nine saves.

Mercep is definitely San Jose St.’s go-to option on offense, as he has scored 37 goals off of 75 total shot attempts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are quite familiar with Mercep’s skill, having met in the Mountain Pacific Invitational tournament last month. In that tightly-contested game, which UCSB won 13-12, Mercep scored six goals.</p>\n<p>What’s even more impressive is, at one point this season, Mercep had a four-game streak of scoring six goals, one of which took place in the loss to UCSB.</p>\n<p>While Mercep gives San Jose St. an offensive force, UCSB has a lesser need to rely on a single player. UCSB’s three-headed arsenal consisting of Ivan Gvozdanovic, Boris Jovanovic, and Shane Hauschild has contributed to over one-third of Santa Barbara’s total goals this season at 62.</p>\n<p>An interesting dynamic of Friday’s game in San Jose will be Shane Hauschild competing against his younger brother Ben.</p>\n<p>Both brothers went to San Marcos High in Santa Barbara and interestingly enough are leading their respective teams in total steals this season. Shane leads the Gauchos with 17 while Ben holds 21 on the year.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the result of their matchup with San Jose State, the Gauchos will undoubtedly be focused and motivated for an even higher-stakes game less than 24 hours later when they play Stanford.</p>\n<p>After losing two close games to USC and Cal back-to-back, the Cardinal have bounced back and are now on a two-match win streak as they await UCSB.</p>\n<p>Stanford’s key players this year have been redshirt freshman Ben Hallock and junior Blake Parrish.</p>\n<p>Both Hallock and Parrish, playing as drivers, have combined for 53 goals this season, nearly a third of Stanford’s total goals this year.</p>\n<p>Although Hallock and Parrish both stand out among the Cardinal in terms of scoring, Stanford’s defense should also draw attention.</p>\n<p>Before playing USC and Cal, Stanford had held its opponents to eight or fewer points per game.</p>\n<p>Stanford’s goalkeepers have so far earned a GAA (goals against average) of 6.00, while Gaucho goalkeepers have tallied a GAA of 8.89. This means that UCSB has given up almost nine goals per game, while Stanford only allowed six.</p>\n<p>Head coach Wolf Wigo will likely be tuning the Gauchos’ defense in preparation to play his old team.</p>\n<p>Wigo holds the sixth spot on the Stanford career goals list, which is spearheaded by Bret Bonanni and Tony Azevedo.</p>\n<p>Last year, with UCSB ranked No. 7 and Stanford at No. 5, the Gauchos upset the Cardinal 7-6 at Campus Pool for their first win versus Stanford in four years.</p>\n<p>The Cardinal likely still bitter and the memory of that game only a year old, Saturday’s matchup will be intense and one for bragging rights.</p>\n<p>No. 8 UCSB will visit No. 16 San Jose State at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 13 and No. 4 Stanford at noon on Saturday, Oct. 14.</p>\n<p><em>A

After a few possessions in, which each team came up short of scoring, the Waves got on the board first via a Marko Asic goal with 5:18 remaining in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>UCSB didn’t stay behind for long; however, as the Gauchos answered 18 seconds later with a goal of their own courtesy of redshirt freshman Adam Lott.</p>\n<p>With the game tied 1-1, Pepperdine redshirt senior Mark Urban reached the net to give the Waves a 2-1 lead at 4:37 in the first.</p>\n<p>Following a couple unsuccessful attempts at capitalizing on Pepperdine exclusions, UCSB eventually tied the game 2-2 after a steal at one end led to freshman attacker Cole Brosnan’s goal on the other, leaving only 1:29 left in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Although the Waves kept pursuing the goal, UCSB’s sophomore goalkeeper Justyn Barrios prevented two close shots from reaching the net.</p>\n<p>With the quarter coming to a close, a Pepperdine exclusion led to a goal by none other than junior Boris Jovanovic. Jovanovic’s capitalization off the power play was perfectly timed as well, leaving the Waves with only two seconds before the break.</p>\n<p>At the end of the first quarter, UCSB led Pepperdine 3-2.</p>\n<p>After winning the sprint to start the second quarter, UCSB senior Reed Cotterill quickly extended the Gauchos’ lead to 4-2 when he scored at the 7:24 mark.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine seemed to have plenty of opportunities following the Cotterill goal, but Barrios again came up big with talented saves to keep the Gauchos’ two-goal lead. With momentum off of their defensive stand, the Gauchos increased their lead to 3 through Adam Lott’s second goal of the night.</p>\n<p>With 5:57 remaining in the second quarter, Pepperdine found themselves getting the ball back down 5-2 but still determined to get past Barrios. With 4:01 remaining, the Waves finally scored again with a goal from sophomore George Mooney to make the game 5-3.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine seemed unable to catch up to UCSB; however, as the Gauchos’ leading scorer sophomore utility Ivan Gvozdanovic fired in a shot to goal which put the Waves down 6-3 with only 2:04 left in the half.</p>\n<p>Following a hectic sequence in which both teams had chances to capitalize, the horn sounded to end the second quarter, leaving the Gauchos in the lead 6-3 at the half.</p>\n<p>Despite losing the sprint to start the third quarter, the Waves increased their physicality to start the second half in order to generate offense. Sophomore Mate Toth earned the honors of bringing his team within two by taking advantage of a UCSB exclusion with 7:07 on the clock.</p>\n<p>The Waves used this physicality to hold the Gauchos scoreless throughout the third, but Pepperdine failed to score again after a goal by senior Chandler Rockwell brought them within 1 with 6:07 still to go in the quarter.</p>\n<p>The rest of the third quarter saw a handful of turnovers and missed shots by both teams, as well as some more crowd-sparking saves by Justyn Barrios.</p>\n<p>Wasting no time, the Waves won the sprint to start the fourth quarter and broke down the Gauchos’ defense over a few possessions to eventually lead to Mate Toth’s second goal of the night with 6:48 remaining to tie the game up 6-6.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes of back and forth play, the Gauchos again took advantage of a Pepperdine exclusion via a goal by senior attacker Josh Jordan. After converting on the power play to go up 7-6, UCSB went up 8-6 courtesy of Ivan Gvozdanovic’s goal with only 3:40 left on the clock, forcing a Pepperdine timeout.</p>\n<p>After two more clutch saves by Barrios, an odd mix up from the Gaucho bench resulted in the Waves being given a free 5 meter shot. Asic eagerly scored the free shot to bring his team within a one-point deficit of 8-7 with 1:56 remaining.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos refused to allow a Pepperdine comeback, as Boris Jovanovic scored his second goal of the game with just 1:14 on the clock. With just 13 seconds left on the clock and the Gauchos up 9-7, chants of “this one’s over” by the home crowd seemed to inspire the Waves to score their final goal, which was netted by junior utility/attacker Marko Asic with 11 seconds left.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ran out the remainder of the clock to secure the 9-8 victory.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos and Waves ended up only being separated by one goal, anyone at Campus Pool would attest to how important Barrios’ performance was throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Wolf Wigo had high praise for his sophomore goalkeeper after the game.</p>\n<p>“He played great that game,” Wigo said, “had a lot of big saves. He definitely helped us build that lead.”</p>\n<p>With an outstanding 13 total saves on the night, Barrios has shown he is worthy of his coach’s compliments.</p>\n<p>Coach Wigo’s praise has a lot of weight to it, as the former captain of the USA Water Polo Men’s National Team and three-time Olympian has a good idea of what it takes to win.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face No. 1 USC at noon this Sunday, Oct. 8 at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Pepperdine has lost their last four games, with each loss coming from games against top-ranked teams in Cal, No. 5 Pacific, UC Irvine and No. 1 USC.</p>\n<p>If last season is any indicator of how Thursday’s matchup will go, UCSB holds an advantage after winning three of their four matchups with Pepperdine last year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to limit Pepperdine’s offensive production and disrupt the Waves’ sets if they expect to improve to 9-6, as all of the games UCSB won against Pepperdine last year featured the Waves being held to under 10 points.</p>\n<p>With yet another tough matchup for the Gauchos, they will likely rely on heavy scoring from senior attacker Shane Hauschild, junior driver Boris Jovanovic and sophomore utility Ivan Gvozdanovic.</p>\n<p>With 17 goals on the season, Hauschild is currently the team’s third-leading scorer behind Jovanovic and Gvozdanovic.</p>\n<p>Hauschild will certainly be leading the charge against the Waves, as the fourth-year has proven himself a leader and consistent scorer for the Gauchos over the last three years. With 10 steals so far this season, Hauschild also brings an element of defensive intensity that the Gauchos will need to draw from in order to overcome Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Other big factors for the Gauchos will be the performances of Jovanovic and Gvozdanovic, who will both have to maintain their skilled play this season if they want to get a win before facing off against a talented USC team Saturday. The Serbian duo of Jovanovic and Gvozdanovic have provided 28 points each so far this season, but it’s noteworthy that Gvozdanovic has achieved this off a mere 53 shots.</p>\n<p>Gvozdanovic will certainly be pressured by Pepperdine around the goal, but perhaps the Gauchos will get increased production from some of their other players, such as redshirt freshman Adam Lott and true freshman Chad Nelson. Lott and Nelson obviously have a drop-off of shot attempts when looking at the team’s leading scorers, but they both have impressively shot over .600 so far this season.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most shocking aspect heading into Thursday’s matchup between the Gauchos and the Waves is that Pepperdine’s junior utility Marko Asic has only missed two shot attempts this season. Out of just 44 shots, Asic has recorded 42 goals, 54 points and has a remarkable shooting percentage of .955. Asic also has 11 steals on the year, so his presence will be felt at both ends of the pool.</p>\n<p>To go along with Asic’s amazing performance so far this season, teammate redshirt senior attacker Mark Urban has been putting up impressive numbers during his redshirt senior campaign. Urban is second on the team in terms of scoring, close behind Asic with 53 points, but he has dished out 24 assists this season, more than double of any Gaucho’s assists this year.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s star-powered offense will certainly test UCSB’s defense, but the young trio of goalkeepers, spearheaded by Santa Barbara High alumnus Justyn Barrios, will look to continue to improve against some of the best scorers in the country.</p>\n<p>This matchup will be one of two times the Gauchos and Waves face off this season, so expect both teams to try to dictate their tempo and respective game-plans early.</p>\n<p>No. 8 UCSB takes on No. 9 Pepperdine at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 5, at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 5, 2017,

The 12th-place finish was high enough for him to receive the bid to the NCAA Championships.</p>\n<p>Now, this might seem like another success story of a talented college athlete, but Kuskey’s path has been far from the norm and much more insightful.</p>\n<p>Most Division I athletes have been playing their respective sports growing up, becoming familiar with the ins and outs, learning the accompanying techniques and etiquette. Most Division I athletes also have access to a facility that is suitable for hosting competitions. Kuskey isn’t like most Division 1 athletes.</p>\n<p>Growing up in the Santa Barbara area, Kuskey attended Santa Ynez Valley Union High and graduated in 2012. Gifted athletically, Kuskey played football and basketball, and was also on varsity golf for all four years. On top of this, he was the captain of the golf team as a junior and senior. For someone who will be competing at the highest level of collegiate track in roughly a week, Kuskey’s high school athletic resume is missing something.</p>\n<p>Because track season occurred at the same time as golf season in high school, Kuskey was forced to stick with golf in the spring sports, never getting the shot to become a four-sport athlete. Being so talented at golf, Kuskey’s choice was simple: He continued playing golf, never running track.</p>\n<p>After receiving a one-year deferred admission from USC, his dream school, Kuskey decided to go to SBCC for a year before fighting on as a Trojan. However, after a year in Santa Barbara, there would be no USC Fight Song in Kuskey’s future.</p>\n<p>While at SBCC, Kuskey decided to begin training as a decathlete. Decathletes compete in four track events as well as six field events. Kuskey described his decision to pursue track, “It was always a dream of mine to play a sport in college; I was athletic in high school.” Being a three-sport athlete and then just deciding to give decathlete training a try, Kuskey is more than just “athletic.”</p>\n<p>As he was on the track at SBCC, Kuskey was spotted by someone from UCSB who saw potential in the track and field novice — so much potential, in fact, that Kuskey was convinced to come to UCSB for track and field as a freshman.</p>\n<p>The javelin emerged as Kuskey’s specialty, and all of a sudden, after having never run a day of track in high school, Kuskey was competing at his first NCAA regionals in Austin, Texas, as a sophomore.</p>\n<p>“It was really unexpected, actually, [but] I’ve always sort of been a really competitive type and never really liked the feeling of being bad at something,” Kuskey said. “It’s obviously a lot of work and javelin is a very technical event. It took a lot of endurance.”</p>\n<p>The mindset and practice from succeeding in multiple other sports helped Kuskey just as much as his natural athleticism. Without the discipline and ability to ignore distractions, he wouldn’t be where he is today.</p>\n<p>“Being in a D1 program for the past four years has taught me a lot about time management, at times doing more track than school, double days — everybody does it on the team,” Kuskey said.</p>\n<p>The hard work and dedication has clearly paid off for Kuskey, but perhaps more rewarding have been the experience of being involved with track in college. While there are plans for the renovation of the UCSB track, the well-known poor condition of the track has been bringing the team together.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we’re the underdogs sort of unites us. The track team is pretty close, we’re all pretty good friends. We use that underdog mentality to our benefit,” Kuskey said. “It’s pretty cool [when you see a] 250-pound thrower is cheering on the distance runners, and you can feel the energy; everyone feeds off each other.”</p>\n<p>This attitude and environment of track has clearly driven Kuskey to thrive in the sport, but Kuskey isn’t slowing down anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Kuskey is succeeding in more than just sports. He is graduating at the end of this quarter with a degree in political science with an emphasis in international relations, and he’s already been commuting two days a week to Manhattan Beach for an internship in sports marketing.</p>\n<p>Kuskey credits his all-around success to his involvement and experience in sports. “Being an athlete and being on track has prepared me for a work environment, and employers know that.”</p>\n<p>While it may seem reasonable for a graduating senior to be stressed with so much going on, Kuskey is extremely calm and ready for everything to come. Ubiquitous questions of jobs, places to stay and graduation photos have of course been evident this spring for seniors, but Kuskey has had to juggle his track postseason on top of all this.</p>\n<p>Thinking about his life after graduation, Kuskey did manage to crack a joke: “It’ll be pretty interesting for the first time in my life without having 8 a.m. workouts.”</p>\n<p>He’s had to travel to Austin, Texas, and now he’s planning his trip to Eugene, Ore. Having a conversation with Kuskey, you’d never know how much he has on his plate due to his composed nature.

Santa Barbara rival Cal Poly will also be in Stockton for the NISC, along with Pacific, who is hosting the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 28-23 on the year, Nevada holds a similar record to UCSB, with a 13-11 conference record. The Wolf Pack is coming off of a disappointing end to the regular season, as they lost their final home series after being taken down by San Diego State two games to one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will be seeing the Nevada team for the second time this year, as the two teams played last on March 4 as part of the St. George Red Desert Classic. The matchup more than two months ago saw Santa Barbara win big 5-1 over the Wolf Pack. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the regular season has been any sort of an indicator, Santa Barbara will be getting a majority of help on Tuesday from junior Jessica Johnston, freshman Alyssa Diaz, senior Kristen Clark and sophomore Sierra Altmeyer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altmeyer leads the Gauchos in runs, home runs, and batting percentage, hitting .357 on the year. At 33 RBIs each, Johnston and Diaz will certainly draw attention from Nevada’s staff while preparing for the game, and Altmeyer is only one RBI behind. Another worry for the Wolf Pack staff will be Kristen Clark’s quickness off the bag, as the former Big West Conference Freshman of the year has stolen a total of 13 bases this season, more than double anyone else on UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the combination of Santa Barbara’s best seems intimidating, Nevada is expected to utilize one of their main weapons, Erika Hansen. The junior outfielder recorded 13 home runs and a bewildering 60 RBIs in the regular season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the outcome of Nevada’s game Tuesday and the Cal Poly-Pacific game later that day, Santa Barbara will face either Cal Poly or Pacific. Since the tournament is double elimination, teams can afford one loss and one win to still reach the regional final.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly is a team the Gauchos are undoubtedly familiar with, as we last played the Mustangs on April 2 as part of a conference series. The Gauchos lost the series, but they shut out the Mustangs while winning by a score of 4-0 in the final game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs went 34-19 overall this season while going 10-11 in the Big West, earning them a spot right behind the Gauchos in the conference tied for third.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly capped their regular season off with a win against UC Riverside, but they ultimately lost their last series against Riverside, only scoring one run in the first two games of the series. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs must be looking to get back on track though, and they’ve proven they can perform for big games like the conference opener against the Gauchos back in April. Before dropping the Riverside series, Cal Poly had won its last two series against Davis and Hawaii, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they look to regain focus heading into the postseason, the Mustangs will be relying on strong performances from the senior pitcher and infielder Sierra Hyland. Hyland is batting .337 on the year while also leading the team in RBIs with 35. </span></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara already has a rough feel for every team, as they have also played the Pacific Tigers this year. Back in February, as part of the Stanford Nike Invitational, the Gauchos bested the Tigers 10-9 in eight innings.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the course of the regular season, Pacific is 27-24 overall and 10-5 in conference play. While their record may not raise many eyebrows, the Tigers are on an incredible hot streak as they’ve won their past nine games in a row and held opponents to a single run or under in seven of the nine games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any team scouting Pacific will notice junior Sydney Lahners, who is averaging an impressive .523 slugging percentage. Lahners also leads the team in hits with 48 as well as recording a team-best 37 RBIs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first game of their well-deserved postseason run, the Gauchos will meet Nevada on Tuesday, May 16, with the first pitch being set for 4 p.m. Following the conclusion of that game, Cal Poly will take on their host, Pacific, at 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p>More information regarding the tournament game times and how to experience the Santa Barbara postseason in person can be found on the Pacific softball <a href=\"http://www.pacifictigers.com/sports/w-softbl/index\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77872\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77872\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-15/gauchos-begin-postseason-run-in-nisc-tournament-against-nevada/","id":33,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[32,31,30],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Final Series of Regular Season Against Conference Champ Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_DSC_1730-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_DSC_1730-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB softball team finished its season this weekend with a competitive series at home against Big West powerhouse Cal State Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_77859\" style=\"width: 489px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/kayla-krantz-tosses-the-ball-toward-first-base-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77859\" data-attachment-id=\"77859\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/kayla-krantz-tosses-the-ball-toward-first-base-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_DSC_1730-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kayla Krantz tosses the ball toward first base.

The Titans ended their regular season with a strong 33-21 overall record to go with their league-best 16-5 conference record.

Sophomore Gaucho pitcher Veronika Gulvin had to deal with a one-shot homer from junior infielder Shianne Brannan, then two unearned runs before closing out the inning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Titan center and infielder Sydney Colenzo hit a sac fly to center field, allowing her teammate, senior catcher Kylie Padilla, to score. Then, following a fielding error at second base, freshman infielder Emily Randall reached home to make the lead 3-0 heading into the bottom of second. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the bottom of the sixth, still down by three runs, the Gauchos started making moves when they got the bases loaded. With Johnston up at bat, it seemed possible for Santa Barbara to get on the board, but Johnston exceeded expectations by getting the Gauchos a 4-3 lead off an incredible grand slam. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite recording three errors on the day, the Gauchos held on to pull off the victory 4-3, not allowing Fullerton to answer back in the top of the seventh inning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Friday’s win, Santa Barbara went on to lose the second game of the series on Saturday, falling to Fullerton 6-5.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos struggled defensively in the game, making four errors just in the first four innings. Fullerton was first to strike again, scoring two runs thanks to an error made at second in the top of the third inning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With eight hits on the day, the Titans saw a lot of time on base, and, luckily for them, they transferred those hits into runs. </span></p>\n<p>Still in the top of the third, a foul out by freshman first-baseman Zoe Richard led to an unearned run for Fullerton. Then, an illegal pitch by the Gauchos extended the Titan lead by 4-0 with yet another unearned run.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While also notching eight hits on the day, the Gauchos struggled to convert their hits into runs.</span></p>\n<p>In the top of the fourth, junior outfielder Samantha Vandiver’s double to center brought in two more unearned runs, making the score 6-0 heading into the bottom of the fourth, during which the Gauchos again failed to score.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While quiet up to this point, the Gauchos stomped back in the bottom of the seventh, starting with senior infielder Emily Brucelas hitting a single to shortstop, bringing in freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz for the RBI and moving senior outfielder Stacy Cavazos to second base. On the board with a run, UCSB started catching fire. Cavazos scored off of a throwing error made by the Titans, and then Brucelas reached home for an unearned run off another throwing error. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still down by three runs, the Gauchos did their best to come back, nearly making it happen. Friday’s hero, Johnston, singled to left field, bringing in two unearned runs with senior outfielder Kristen Clark and freshman outfielder Nicole Marino reaching home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite their efforts, the comeback was cut short for the Gauchos as they fell 6-5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second game on Saturday and the final game of the series, Santa Barbara junior pitcher Lena Mayer shut out the Titans, only allowing four hits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton had quite a different game than Game 2, as they struggled against Mayer and failed to score at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara, on the other hand, was able to finally score in the bottom of the sixth after struggling in the first five innings. In what involved a trio of UCSB’s best this season, Clark reached home, and Johnston reached second off of Diaz’s single up the middle. Then, sophomore infielder Melanie Menor hit a single up the middle of her own, bringing in Johnston for the score and game lead of 2-0. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It looked as if the Titans may make an effort at getting on the board in the seventh, as they had two runners on base with only one out. However, Mayer came up big with two straight strikeouts to end the game and series. Mayer shut out the Titans for the first time in their last 18 performances.</span></p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos fell in some games this season, their effort and hard work kept them close all year as they worked to improve upon last season and set another solid foundation for a successful season next year.</p>\n<p>In their final game at Campus Diamond, seniors Clark, Brucelas, senior outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa and Cavazos were honored before Game 2, but they aren’t done yet as the Gauchos will participate in the inaugural NISC postseason Tournament which is set to begin Tuesday.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77865\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77865\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/gauchos-win-final-series-of-regular-season-against-conference-champ-fullerton/","id":32,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[31,30,29],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hoping To Regain its Focus in Home Return, Will Host UCD","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-05-at-11.33.45-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-05-at-11.33.45-AM.png?resize=980%2C588&ssl=1","description":"With just three series remaining on the season heading into this weekend, the Gauchos are looking to gain momentum to jumpstart a run for first place.

Prior to having its streak of three consecutive series victories snapped by Hawaii, Santa Barbara had won nine of its last 13 games before dropping the Hawaii series.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As the regular season prepares to conclude, it can be judged that UC Davis has had an underwhelming campaign, having lost each of its conference series. The Aggies have lost eight games out of their last 10, with the most recent disappointment being a series loss at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos trying to regain footing after being outscored by Hawaii by a deficit of 16-7, the struggling UC Davis team presents an opportunity to build up confidence again.</p>\n<p>Despite the low hit total, hitting hasn’t actually been the primary cause for concern for UCSB as of late, as it registered 23 total hits in its previous series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ biggest concern seemed to simply be transferring those hits into runs. This is easier said than done, but the Aggies will likely face an ambitious Santa Barbara team looking to keep up its hit count and hopefully capitalize with runners on base to increase the amount of runs scored.</p>\n<p>Heading into the start of the series Friday, Santa Barbara holds the offensive advantage over UC Davis, leading the Aggies overall as a team in runs, hits, home runs and RBIs with a collective .283 batting average, which trumps the Aggies’ average of .261.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, infielder Sierra Altmeyer has been a large part of their success this season. Holding down second base, the sophomore leads her team in batting percentage with a .382 clip on the year and is also one of her teams’ biggest power hitters while slugging .674.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer has nine home runs to go with an impressive 31 RBIs and 55 hits. Junior outfielder Jessica Johnston has been a big contributor for UCSB this season as well, batting .348 with 56 hits and 24 RBIs over the course of the season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies are led in batting percentage by senior utility Taylor Peters, who is batting .357 and has 46 hits for the year. While not batting at an extraordinary percentage this season (.254), junior infielder Ashley Lotoszynski leads her team with 27 RBIs to go with four home runs.</p>\n<p>UCSB sophomore pitcher Veronika Gulvin has led the team with 38 appearances and the team-best 2.77 ERA; however, with only one upperclassman pitcher, the Gauchos have struggled at times from the mound. The Aggies look to have the advantage when it comes to overall ERA, besting the Gauchos 3.64 to 4.14.</p>\n<p>The last time Santa Barbara faced UC Davis was last season in May, during which it swept the Aggies in Davis in three games.</p>\n<p>While UC Davis’s season is likely over following its last two series, UCSB is in decent position for the postseason. Sitting at 8-7, the Gauchos are tied with Long Beach State for third in the conference, with Cal State Fullerton and CSUN holding first and second place, respectively. Santa Barbara sits four games back from Fullerton, which it will host in its final series of the season.</p>\n<p>Although the Aggies are restricted by their last-place record at this point in the season, nothing’s stopping them from presenting a challenge for the Gauchos and fighting for a competitive series. The Gauchos will look to maintain their strength at home, where they have boasted a 13-4 record this year.</p>\n<p>The series kicks off at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 5, at Campus Diamond. The series will resume on Saturday, May 6, with a doubleheader starting at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77595\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77595\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/ucsb-hoping-to-regain-its-focus-in-home-return-will-host-ucd/","id":1214,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1213,1212,1211],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/43"}},"__N_SSG":true}
