Torres brought in junior outfielders Rachel Loera and Lauren Macleod as well as senior infielder Mattie Scheele.</p>\n<p>Due to the 49ers outhitting the Gauchos by 6-2, Long Beach pitcher Cielo Meza picked up her fourth win of the season. At 4-0, Meza has yet to lose a game this year. Gaucho pitcher Veronika Gulvin took the loss, setting her season record to 18-11.</p>\n<p>In the second game of the series doubleheader, UCSB fired back, defeating Long Beach 5-2. After three hitless innings for the Gauchos, they finally locked in, getting three hits leading to a two-run fourth inning.</p>\n<p>First, sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer brought in junior outfielder Jessica Johnston off of a double. Shortly after, Santa Barbara extended its 1-0 lead with senior infielder Emily Brucelas’s double to center, bringing in Altmeyer for the run and making the game 2-0.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State answered the Gauchos in the bottom of the fourth when junior utility Jessica Flores scored, courtesy of junior infielder Julia Lombardi’s double.</p>\n<p>The game remained at 2-1 until the top of the sixth, when Alyssa Diaz doubled straight down the right field line, bringing in Altmeyer for the score. Following the play, Diaz was at third.</p>\n<p>Diaz seized the opportunity to score off of a wild pitch, increasing Santa Barbara’s lead to 4-1. The Gauchos didn’t let up in the sixth, as Brucelas homered to left field and made it a four-run lead over the 49ers to start the bottom of the sixth.</p>\n<p>The 49ers made an effort to make up some ground against the Gauchos, as Lombardi went on to single to center and bring in Flores for the score. This made the game 5-2, but it was too little too late for Long Beach, who went scoreless in the final inning. For Santa Barbara, sophomore pitcher Ashley Wright picked up her third win of the season for a 3-2 record.</p>\n<p>In the final game of the series, both teams fought hard, pushing the game to an extra inning in which UCSB pulled ahead with a run to secure the 4-3 win.</p>\n<p>Long Beach, coming off the loss, struck early, scoring two runs in the bottom of the first and then another run in the bottom of the second. The early 49er scoring was thanks to Flores homering to left field, bringing in senior outfielder Sammi Gyerman in the process for the early 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos answered in the top of the second and third, scoring one run in each inning. Alyssa Diaz countered with a home run for Santa Barbara in the second, then Johnston hit a sac-fly to center field, allowing senior outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa to score.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Long Beach, their hot start would end with their unearned run in the bottom of the second. UCSB took advantage of the 49ers going dry, with redshirt freshman Whitney Pemberton singling to left field in the top of the fifth. Senior outfielder Kristen Clark would score on the play, tying the game up at three runs apiece.</p>\n<p>Both teams went scoreless in the next two innings, forcing a decisive eighth inning. The Gauchos wasted no time as they scored on a Brucelas single to third. A throwing error would allow Pemberton to score unearned. The 49ers didn’t answer, giving Santa Barbara the win 4-3.</p>\n<p>With yet another series win for the Gauchos, they sit at a competitive 7-5 in the Big West, while Long Beach falls to 8-4. This doesn’t shake up the conference standings too much, as CSUN remains right with Santa Barbara following a series win over Cal Poly. Fullerton’s conference lead has been extended, as they swept Hawaii in their most recent series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, they will travel off the mainland to visit a struggling Hawaii team next, looking for their fourth-straight series win.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77303\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-take-two-from-long-beach-to-maintain-conference-standing/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77303\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-take-two-from-long-beach-to-maintain-conference-standing/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-take-two-from-long-beach-to-maintain-conference-standing/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-take-two-from-long-beach-to-maintain-conference-standing/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/gauchos-take-two-from-long-beach-to-maintain-conference-standing/","id":1213,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1212,1211,1210],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Enter 49er Territory Looking for Upset, Hope to Stay in Big West Race","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsUCR-170409-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsUCR-170409-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently tied for third in the Big West standings with a record of 5-4, the UCSB softball team will look to continue climbing the ladder against the top team in the conference LBSU.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Following a 2-1 series win over CSUN, the UCSB softball team will face off against a very talented Long Beach State team this weekend.

Gaucho Jessica Johnston earned the Big West Softball Field Player of the Week for her performance against CSUN. Johnston, a junior outfielder for UCSB, brought in three runs in the last game facing the Matadors to secure the series win.</p>\n<p>Batting .364 for the year, Johnston owns the second best hitting clip on the team. This is an improvement on last season, in which Johnston held a .322 batting average. On the season, Johnston has four homers following her most recent shot over the right field against CSUN.</p>\n<p>Another leader for the Gauchos this season has been sophomore Sierra Altmeyer. The infielder has so far this season averaged a team-best .406 batting percentage. Aside from this impressive percentage, Altmeyer has homered nine times this season in addition to producing 30 RBIs, both team highs.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer and teammate Johnston will be looking to knock off the current first-place team this weekend while the 49ers will attempt to increase their lead in the league.</p>\n<p>Last season the 49ers won the series against UCSB, outscoring the Gauchos’ 26 runs to eight over the course of three games.</p>\n<p>Along with having to be aware of the 49ers’ bats, Santa Barbara will hope to combat LBSU’s thriving defensive play. Long Beach is coming off not allowing a single run in 28 innings in its series sweep of the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Much of Long Beach State’s success this year has been thanks to senior transfer Sammi Gyerman. The 49ers’ outfielder is currently leading the team in batting percentage with a .328 average in addition to scoring 12 runs for her team over the season thus far. Gyerman’s performance in the past week prompted her nomination for the Big West Softball Field Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>Also leading the 49ers this season has been sophomore infielder Nichole Fry. After an impressive first season that saw the 2016 true freshman start all but one game, Fry has been batting an average of .289 this season to go along with a team-best 24 runs scored. Over the weekend, Fry recorded her second home run of the season, securing the 2-0 win for the 49ers over the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to Long Beach in hopes of making up for last season’s series against the 49ers, with Game 1 being held Saturday, April 22, at 1 p.m. Following Game 1, Game 2 will be held at 3:30 p.m. The series will end with Game 3 on Sunday the April 23 with a start time of 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of April 13, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77148\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77148\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/gauchos-enter-49er-territory-looking-for-upset-hope-to-stay-in-big-west-race/","id":1212,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1211,1210,1209],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Remains at Home in Search of 3rd Consecutive Series Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsTournament-170311-DustinHarris-07-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsTournament-170311-DustinHarris-07-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sitting in the middle of the pack of the Big West standings, the UCSB softball team is looking to ascend within the rankings in its second conference series of the season against CSUN at home.

Diaz was also nominated for Big West Softball Field Player of the Week following her solid weekend performance.</p>\n<p>Sierra Altmeyer has been an effective second baseman recently. The sophomore has been racking up career stats in her second season and could emerge to equally challenge the Matadors’ hitting. Altmeyer is batting .392, while at the same time leading the Big West in runs with 35.</p>\n<p>In the three-game series against UC Riverside, Altmeyer went six-for-nine at the plate.</p>\n<p>Aside from players with recent blow-up performances, a Gaucho to watch is senior outfielder Kristen Clark. Almost a month ago, the former Big West Freshman of the Year passed Christine Ramos to lead UCSB in all-time hits with an impressive 274.</p>\n<p>Clark has had spectacular seasons since her freshman year, and she’s still racking up numbers and helping a talented Gaucho team head in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Although it’s still early in the season, UCSB sits in a decent position of fourth in the Big West standings with there being a three-way tie for first between Cal Poly, CSUN and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have yet to play the Matadors this season, last year’s series between the two resulted in CSUN winning two of three games.</p>\n<p>The Matadors would go on to place second in the Big West, right behind the regular season champion for 2016, Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>UCSB placed fourth in the standings last year, finishing 28-28 and 11-10 in conference play.</p>\n<p>This CSUN series for UCSB should be competitive as well as a good test for both teams with the Gauchos and Matadors both looking to build off of last year’s performances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to avenge last year’s series loss against CSUN beginning at home Friday, April 14, at 3 p.m. and continue with a double header on Saturday, April 15, with games at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 13, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76867\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76867\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-remains-at-home-in-search-of-third-consecutive-series-win/","id":1209,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1208,1207,1206],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Go Undefeated in Utah, Return Home for Gaucho Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Facing a must-win situation as the Big West schedule gradually comes closer, the UCSB softball team swept each opponent at the St. George Red Desert Classic.

With the Mavericks only recording four hits throughout the game, UCSB capitalized by getting the run it needed to win in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Following Sunday’s game, the Gauchos are now 3-0 when playing in extra innings.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos got out to a sluggish start against Southern Utah, giving up three early runs in the top of the first inning. For Southern Utah, senior first baseman Karlee Manzione homered and brought three runs in, allowing her teammates senior infielder/outfielder Payton Hart and junior outfielder Sarah Murphy to score.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasn’t fazed, however, as they answered back in the bottom of the first, starting with sophomore second baseman Sierra Altmeyer’s homer, which brought junior outfielder Jessica Johnston in to score as well.</p>\n<p>Both teams were off to fast starts, and the game sat at 3-2 Thunderbirds following the first inning. The Gauchos went on in the bottom of the second to tie the game 3-3 with the help of a single by Hinojosa, bringing freshman infielder Kayla Krantz in to score a run.</p>\n<p>After some scoreless innings for both teams, the Gauchos secured a one-run lead in the fifth. At this point the Gauchos held all the momentum, keeping the Thunderbirds at bay thanks to junior pitcher Lena Mayer, who got her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>With a shot from Johnston, Hinojosa was brought in, securing the Gauchos’ 5-3 victory over the Thunderbirds. Johnston went 4-4 at the plate during this, including bringing in Clark for a run with a single up the middle.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Saturday, the Gauchos faced off against a Nevada team that would be shut out in five innings by Gulvin, who earned 10 strikeouts. After two innings, the teams were tied at 0-0, but in the third a wild pitch from Nevada saw UCSB senior third baseman Emily Brucelas score. Brucelas went on to bring in Altmeyer for a 2-0 lead. Soon after, freshman infielder Whitney Pemberton brought in Hinojosa with a single.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of fifth, Nevada still scoreless at this point, the Gauchos increased their lead to 5-0 with contributions from Diaz and Altmeyer off of a sacrifice fly from junior infielder Samantha Lujan and a single from Brucelas, who went a perfect 3-3 at bat.</p>\n<p>Nevada finally scored with an effort from junior outfielder Aaliyah Gibson, allowing senior outfielder Raquel Martinez to score the sole run for the Wolf Pack. Beating Nevada 5-1, the Gauchos built off of momentum from their two wins Friday.</p>\n<p>On Friday, UCSB looked to keep things rolling against Iowa State following the morning win against Utah Valley. The Gauchos got on the board early with the help of Pemberton’s solo homer in the top of the second inning. In the bottom of the third, the Cyclones tied up the game with a run from senior outfielder Cathlin Bingham.</p>\n<p>The next three innings saw the advancement of a 4-1 Gaucho lead, beginning with a run from Pemberton in the fourth. In the fifth, Pemberton’s fourth double of the day saw Johnston score to establish a 3-1 lead. The Gauchos continued with another run in the sixth, thanks to a sac fly by Clark’s, which brought freshman infielder Genesis Ramirez home to make the game 4-1.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the bottom of the seventh, the game appeared to be coming to a close. However, the Cyclones rallied with the help of a single from sophomore catcher Kaylee Bosworth and a homer from freshman infielder Talyn Lewis. With the game now a close 4-3, freshman pitcher Felisha Noriega came up big for the Gauchos with a final strikeout for her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Friday, the Gauchos competed against a talented Utah Valley team, squeezing a 9-7 win over the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>Following the second inning, the Wolverines were up 4-0 after a four-run inning. Pemberton finally got the Gauchos on the board with a double in the fourth to bring Altmeyer home. Following two runs from Clark and freshman catcher Nyssa Williams, at a second at bat in the fourth Pemberton doubled to bring in Altmeyer and Johnston for a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines used some momentum to rally and score three runs in the bottom of the sixth, making the game 7-5. Down two runs in the seventh, UCSB needed to come up big to secure a win, and they did just that. Pemberton made her presence felt again, hitting a double to bring Johnston home to make the score 7-6.</p>\n<p>Following a Krantz strikeout and with two outs on the board, UCSB rallied to make the game 9-7 with hits from Lujan and Hinojosa, allowing Altmeyer, Brucelas and Pemberton to score at home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos not only came up big on offense in the seventh, but they also shut out Utah Valley in the final inning to win the high-scoring game 9-7.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 9-10 thanks to their 5-0 sweep in Utah. They will look to continue that energy as they play host to teams in the Gaucho Classic, which will tip off Saturday, March 11 at 1:30 p.m. at Campus Diamond. The Gauchos will play Sacred Heart to open their weekend and will also face George Washington, San Diego and Northern Colorado twice over the course of the Classic.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76210\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76210\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/","id":42,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[41,40,39],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/43"}},"__N_SSG":true}
