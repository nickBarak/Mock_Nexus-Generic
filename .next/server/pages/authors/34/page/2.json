Market after she stole a bottle of tequila. Deputies arrested the suspect for theft and minor in possession. Later on Monday, deputies responded to reported gunshots at Ocean Meadows golf course. I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) and Goleta Sheriff’s units responded and established a perimeter around the course and an air unit was deployed. Further investigation of the incident determined reports to be unfounded.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, IVFP units responded to an anonymous call about animal mistreatment taking place in I.V. Authorities identified and requested to search April Stewart’s vehicle to check the welfare of her dogs and found she was in possession of a used hypodermic needle and a glass pipe commonly used to smoke methamphetamine. According to the IVFP, residue left in the pipe indicated recent use. Stewart’s animals were also found to be not properly cared for and Stewart was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, violation of probation and cruelty to animals.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, deputies subdued a man refusing to pay a cab driver on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde. The suspect, later identified as Darris Cotton, was seen evading the cab driver and attempting to flee. Deputies were able to contact Cotton, who the cab driver wanted to have arrested for petty theft for failure to pay. After deputies conducted a records check on Cotton, it was discovered he was on parole for robbery and was subsequently arrested for violation of parole.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP stopped SBCC student Jose De Alba, who was walking down the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde carrying a laptop. When confronted, De Alba’s story contained conflicting evidence and upon further investigation deputies found the had just committed a residential burglary, though officials declined to state where the burglary occurred. The laptop was returned and De Alba was arrested.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday, a male subject was reported to be “prowling,” lurking in an area intending to commit a crime, in a backyard on the 6700 block of Pasado. The property resident was able to provide a detailed description of the suspect who was later identified and arrested in an in-field lineup.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, IVFP recorded nine arrests and 12 citations. On the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde, a male subject was observed walking in a small group being extremely loud. The subject was trying to high five passersbys and was determined to be causing a disturbance with the potential to cause a fight. The male and his friends began to flee once they saw law enforcement approaching. Subjects fled for about two blocks but were apprehended at International Food Market. The original male was located in the back parking lot of the store, out of breath and urinating on himself. He was charged for public intoxication, fleeing law enforcement and urinating in public.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, deputies recorded three arrests and six citations. On Sunday night, Pizza My Heart employees reported a female who had been at the restaurant drinking all day. She left and returned later, more intoxicated than she had been when she left. She was socializing with restaurant patrons and then began to pass out on a table. Alone and unable to care for her own safety, she was arrested for public intoxication. Later, Garden Court Security reported an intoxicated male in the courtyard area causing a disturbance. He fled the complex, but was located at 880 Camino del Sur and arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Finally, at approximately 9:15 a.m. on Tuesday the 17th, deputies responded to a call of a subject who appeared to be injured within a vehicle in the parking lot of Goleta Beach.  Upon arrival, it was discovered that the male victim was killed by an apparent gunshot wound.  The Sheriff’s Coroner’s Unit is investigating, but law enforcement reports that at this point no foul play is suspected.   No further information will be released until the victim’s next-of-kin has been notified.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/","id":3778,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3777,3776,3775],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up Feb. 6-9","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WelcomeToIslaVista.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WelcomeToIslaVista.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This past week, law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista, including reports of assault, prowling and thefts.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past week, law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista, including reports of assault, prowling and thefts.</p>\n<p>On Monday, law enforcement answered a call on Camino Pescadero concerning I.V. resident Manuel Rodriguez, who threw two DVD cases at a victim after an argument. Both cases hit the victim in the leg, and she whom suffered swelling and bruising on her inner right knee. Rodriguez became highly agitated once the authorities arrived. The victim later signed a citizen’s arrest and Rodriguez was taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, deputies responded to a call for a possible verbal altercation between domestic partners on the 6600 block of Trigo. Subsequent investigation found there was no argument taking place. However, the 19-year-old male resident, Jose Benitez of Santa Barbara, had three outstanding misdemeanor warrants and was arrested.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, an I.V. Foot Patrol bicycle unit was deployed throughout I.V. and issued eight citations, mostly for alcohol and noise violations, and two physical arrests, one for lewd behavior and the other for prowling at a local church.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP recorded seven physical arrests and 15 citations, mostly for alcohol and noise violations. Also, all IVFP units responded to Storke Road in front of Rusty’s Pizza for a traffic collision with a severe injury and a subject pinned under a vehicle. A juvenile pedestrian was struck as she waited with her family at the bus stop. The driver of the vehicle had lost control immediately after a traffic collision with another driver and then veered onto the curb and bus stop area.</p>\n<p>On Saturday three deputies made six physical arrests and 12 citations.</p>\n<p>At approximately midnight, deputies responded to a call about a suspect prowling in the backyard of a property on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde. The suspect was described as a black male adult, wearing a red baseball cap, grey sweatshirt, blue jeans and carrying a red duffel bag and laptop. Deputies detained the suspect in the alleyway behind the residence on suspicion of prowling. A line-up was conducted and the subjects who had seen him prowling identified him, though they decided they did not want to pursue charges. The identified suspect was not in possession of a duffel bag, and when K9 units arrived on scene, they were unable to locate the duffel bag. The suspect is a person of interest in several possessions of stolen property cases. Because no stolen property was found, the suspect was released and a report was filed for documentation purposes.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60720\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60720\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/weekend-wrap-up-feb-6-9/","id":3773,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3772,3771,3770],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVFP To Begin Citing Cars On Sidewalks","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last week, Isla Vista Foot Patrol announced a policy stating all cars in Isla Vista that are parked on or blocking a sidewalk, even in front of residents’ driveways, will be cited for traffic violat...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60145\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60145\" data-attachment-id=\"60145\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/ivfp-to-begin-citing-cars-on-sidewalks/sidewalks-dp_stephen-manga-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422246789\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sidewalks-DP\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60145\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sidewalks-DP_Stephen-Manga-3-1024x683.jpg?resize=650%2C433\" alt=\"Vehicles parked in a manner that is on or blocking sidewalks will soon be cited by Isla Vista Foot Patrol.

According to IVFP officials, deputies began notifying I.V. residents and property managers in November to make residents aware of the rule change come Feb. 15. The purpose of the new citations, according to the policy, will be to increase pedestrian visibility on the sidewalks and therefore increase their safety by keeping them out of the street.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the high population density in I.V. causes residents to park illegally on sidewalks to make room for more cars.</p>\n<p>“Rising costs make people want more roommates, which means more cars,” Plastino said. “They’re trying to slam more cars into a driveway that wasn’t designed that way.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties. If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk? – First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, the practice of parking on the sidewalk forces pedestrians out into the street and into the path of oncoming traffic. Citations will also be issued to allow pedestrians with physical limitations safe use of the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Third-year biochemistry major Sam Perez said he has not ever seen law enforcement officers try to keep people out of the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen I.V. Foot Patrol, or any law enforcement for that matter, make an effort to keep students out of the street here,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said the law wasn’t enforced in the past because I.V. lacked a complete sidewalk network.</p>\n<p>“You go over to Goleta and you’re not going to see a whole bunch of people just standing in the middle of the road, because they have sidewalks there,” Plastino said. “So the thought was: If you’re a pedestrian and you’re walking down DP, you need to be on the sidewalk; you can’t be in the roadway.”</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph said the enforcement does not make sense because parties tend to keep people off sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties,” Joseph said, “If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear. – IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino</p></blockquote>\n<p>Plastino said California law states that cars cannot park in a way that blocks sidewalks and that now that DP has a sidewalk running its full length, IVFP can enforce the law correctly.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that people start realizing that the sidewalks are there now, and sidewalks can be utilized for pedestrian use,” Plastino said. “If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear.”</p>\n<p>First-year biopsychology major Adam Chukhman said it would be hard to keep everyone off the street even with the new restrictions because people simply don’t want to walk on the sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“The reason people walk on the street isn’t the lack of good sidewalks,” Chukhman said, “it’s the lack of want to walk on the sidewalk.”</p>\n<p>First-year chemical engineering major, John Stair said the he does not think citations would keep people from walking in the street.</p>\n<p>“It’s clear that they want people to stay off the street and stay on the sidewalk, but that’s just never going to happen,” Stair said.</p>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, I.V. will need more funding to be able to complete sidewalk installation along El Nido, Trigo, Seville and Madrid roads, as well as the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Seconds after units cleared the call, the roommate flagged down the IVFP officers in the street and stated that Michael B was brandishing a knife. After investigation, Michael B was arrested on a citizen’s arrest for brandishing a weapon and battery.</p>\n<p>During the course of the investigation, officers also learned Michael B had two legally registered rifles, a modified AK-47 and a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun in the house, which Michael B agreed to turn over to the officers for safekeeping. In addition, the roommate agreed to turn over his gas pistol to the officers for safekeeping.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the AK-47 had been professionally modified to fit legal California firearm standards and not function as an assault rifle, which has been prohibited in California since the 1989 approval of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing is that it fires single rounds at a time instead of automatic,” Plastino said. “It still fires a 7.62mm round, which is still the standard size round for an AK-47.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, because Michael B did not use the firearms in any act of violence nor give any indication that he would, he was not legally required to relinquish possession of his guns, although Plastino believes Michael B was correct to do so.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, the guy made a good decision,” Plastino said. “He made a thoughtful decision in allowing us to take his weapons from him because he didn’t have to. He committed a sort of violent crime, brandishing a knife, so he needs to cool off and calm down before we’ll return his weapons to him.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, law enforcement officers pulled over a vehicle with four juveniles and one adult inside during a routine traffic stop because the headlights were turned off while the car was in motion. The driver, a juvenile, was under the influence of alcohol, while two more passengers were intoxicated with alcohol and marijuana with the other two passengers in possession of cocaine. All subjects were cited and their parents called to pick them up. The legal adult, 18-year-old Michael Davis, was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail for possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p>Later on Friday night, at approximately 11:00 p.m., a female was approached and verbally assaulted by her ex-boyfriend, Carrington Cox, outside of 7-11. When the victim’s current boyfriend stepped in to intervene, a shoving match ensued, at which point Cox struck the victim’s current boyfriend in the face with a skateboard. Cox then broke free of the scuffle and ran towards his ex-girlfriend, stomping on her left leg and fleeing south on El Embarcadero. The female victim sustained a fractured tibia and extensive knee injuries.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, the Delta Gamma sorority requested extra patrol in light of the social media shooting rumors, during which officers noticed Santa Barbara City College student Joshua McKenzie Smith at an upstairs, outside door of the sorority house.

The summit will also include various food-related workshops and activities as well as lectures by speakers such as food justice advocate Nikki Silvestri and renowned chef Crystal DeLongpré, also known as Food Network’s Chef Pink. The event will also feature a screening of “Occupy the Farm,” a documentary following food justice advocates.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Food Co-Op General Manager Melissa Cohen, the summit will allow attendees to become exposed to new ideas, solutions and innovations regarding food distribution and consumption that can prompt others to make positive impacts on the current food system.</p>\n<p>“People are bringing their expertise from projects they’re working on in their own communities and campuses outward so that kind of information can be shared and modeled,” Cohen said. “Because the best thing that can happen in a situation like this is people present projects that can be replicated.”</p>\n<p>According to Tim Galarneau, a member of the advisory board at Real Food Challenge, which is a campaign to shift the way universities source food, the summit is designed to be all-inclusive and allow all attendees to both learn and participate.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited to see a cross section of students, staff/faculty, and community partners coming together on MLK weekend to engage in conversations and planning toward bridging access, equity, and justice in our food system,” Galarneau said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Food Bank Chair and event organizer Katie Freeze said she is looking forward to listening to seasoned chefs and food advocates impart their wisdom upon event attendees.<br>\n“Summit participants will have the opportunity to enjoy meals prepared by local chefs, participate in educational workshops and listen to inspirational keynote speakers,” Freeze said.</p>\n<p>The summit will also include a series of talks and workshops designed to help attendees learn more about the food they eat, where it comes from and how to protect and conserve food resources. Workshops such as “Santa Barbara County Food Action Plan and Food Justice: Health, Access, Environment, Labor,” will take place in classrooms on the first floor of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Freeze said she hopes the summit will bring student attention to issues regarding the nation’s currently “broken” food system.</p>\n<p>“The summit’s primary mission is to start a dialogue surrounding food justice and food security in the UC community,” Freeze said, “and to help students realize the role they play in helping to fix our broken food system on a local and statewide level.”</p>\n<p>Keynote speaker Silvestri, who in addition to co-founding food justice advocacy campaign Live Real and directing national clean energy economy organization Green For All also developed a course curriculum for the UC system, has advocated statewide for environmental justice and political ecology programs for the last ten years. Cohen said she is particularly looking forward to the opportunity to hear Silvestri speak and hopes students will take advantage of the opportunity as well.</p>\n<p>“Nikki Silvestri is a huge person who influences me, helping me feel comfortable to have the right lexicon — the right words and the right knowledge — for how to talk about … these issues,” Cohen said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59814\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59814\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/ucsb-to-host-summit-on-food-justice/","id":2931,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[2930,2929,2928],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up Jan. 9-11","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C232&ssl=1","description":"This past week, law enforcement officers with UCSB Police Department (UCPD) and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to various incidents including noise ordinance infractions, abuse of the eld...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past week, law enforcement officers with UCSB Police Department (UCPD) and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to various incidents including noise ordinance infractions, abuse of the elderly and theft.</p>\n<p>According to a weekly crime report, during the night shift last Wednesday law enforcement officers attempted to issue a noise ordinance violation on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive. During the confrontation with a resident of the home, the officers noticed a student attempting to conceal half an ounce of marijuana for which he did not have a medical card by destroying it. When the officers approached the individual, he provided a false identity and was subsequently arrested.</p>\n<p>The following day, officers stopped a vehicle from “Jump on the School Bus” transportation while it was loading passengers on Ocean Road and Trigo Road. The bus was playing excessively loud music and honking its horn to catch the attention of potential nearby riders, which led to the officers on patrol to question bus driver Nicholas Zwart. UCPD officers cited Zwart for not having insurance, and warned Zwart against loading the bus on campus.</p>\n<p>This past Friday officers logged 9 arrests and 22 citations, with a notable charge for abuse of the elderly. Officers were called to check the welfare of a 68-year-old amputee and Vietnam War veteran at Friendship Manor on Friday night. The victim’s caretaker, Russell Tokle, had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Upon entering his apartment, the officers found it unsanitary to the point of being uninhabitable, littered with things like cat feces and rotten food. Tokle was arrested for his previous warrant and is under view for elder abuse. The victim was granted an immediate move out of the apartment and taken into the care of Adult Protective Services.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, officers responded to a noise citation on the 6500 block of Segovia. Around midnight, the resident said he would turn down his loud music, but at 2 a.m. the music resumed its high volume. Officers returned to the residence, shut down the party and issued a noise citation. As party-goers filed onto the street from the party, law enforcement officers noticed one man too intoxicated to take care of himself. While attempting to place him into the patrol car, a fellow student interfered, attempting to stop officers from arresting the man. Following the altercation, both students were arrested for a drunk in public citation and a citation for interfering with law enforcement, respectively.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, IVFP units responded to a theft call at the Subway on Pardall Road. Upon arrival, officers found the victim fighting with the suspected perpetrator and ended the conflict immediately. During the investigation, deputies determined that the suspect was in possession of the victim’s backpack, an iPhone and several other stolen items. The suspect was then arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Officers also responded to a call about a male breaking a window at the 7-Eleven on Seville Road this past Saturday. IVFP deputies located the suspect, Larry Anthony Ortiz, who was covered in blood and appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. Ortiz had broken a window at 7-Eleven, along with a window of a nearby car parked on Sabado Tarde. Ortiz was arrested for vandalism and later charged with battery against a police officer after spitting in the deputy’s face.</p>\n<p>Deputies responded to another report of vandalism on Sunday, this time at the Isla Vista Clinic on Embarcadero del Mar. Upon arrival, police observed another broken window and blood spatter in the area. Deputies believe this incident to be related to the vandalism arrest from the night before.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59688\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59688\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/","id":4796,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4795,4794,4793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Campus Remembers UCPD Officer","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Borrayo1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Borrayo1.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Police Department (UCPD) Sgt.

Tony Borrayo died in the early hours of the morning while he was asleep at home with his family last Sunday on Jan. 4.</p>\n<p>A cause of death has not been determined. During his time with UCPD, Borrayo received numerous awards and accolades, including a Supervisory Certificate from the California Peace Officers Standardized Training and the prestigious H. Thomas Guerry Award, given to officers by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors for excellence in law enforcement.</p>\n<p>According to Borravo’s colleague and UCPD officer Sgt. Mark Signa, Borrayo was an “amazing member” of the Isla Vista and Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant Borrayo has been a friend and part of the UC/IV community for almost 20 years,” Signa said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to a statement released by the Office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Borrayo is Santa Barbara born and raised, and graduated from Dos Pueblos High School in Santa Barbara before attending Santa Barbara City College. He began his career at UCSB in 1994, when he worked at the UCen and in the Parking and Transportation Services before eventually becoming a police officer with UCPD.</p>\n<p>According to Assistant Director of Student Programs Marilyn Dukes, Borrayo was a highly regarded member of UCPD and said his passing was unexpected.</p>\n<p>“[I] have worked with Tony at events for many years, so his passing came as quite a shock,” Dukes said. “Tony was very committed to his work and to the campus community and my sympathies go out to his family and the UCPD who are, no doubt, feeling his loss very deeply.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang’s statement, Borrayo represented both the department and the community at multiple events and ceremonies throughout the state. Borrayo also helped in the creation of the UCPD Honor Guard, and recently joined an advocacy group to aid undocumented students and Dream Scholars.</p>\n<p>A memorial service was held on Friday, Jan. 9 at St. Raphael Catholic Church in Goleta. UCPD officers wore memorial patches over their badges in his memory.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/","id":2947,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[2946,2945,2944],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Protesters Convene in Storke Plaza for Rally on Tuition","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students and faculty rallied at Storke Tower Thursday to protest the recently approved the UC tuition increase plan, which caps potential yearly increases at five percent over the next five years, in ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58707\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58707\" data-attachment-id=\"58707\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/protesters-convene-in-storke-plaza-for-rally-on-tuition/protests-on-ucsb-by-stephen-manga_for-11-21-2014-7414/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7414.jpg?fit=1600%2C1137&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1137\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416451512\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Protests on UCSB by Stephen Manga_for 11.21.2014-7414\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7414.jpg?fit=250%2C178&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7414.jpg?fit=888%2C631&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58707\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7414-1024x727.jpg?resize=500%2C349\" alt=\"Students and community members protest in Storke Plaza Thursday at a rally against the recently-approved UC tuition plan.

I need to be able to bring to the legislature and to the governor an overwhelming force from students, from UC and CSU unions, and make them realize how angry you are and how you are demanding a specific course of action, which is $100 million a year for the UC and $100 million a year for the CSU.”</p>\n<p>According to Daraka Larimore-Hall, secretary of the California Democratic Party, who has lobbied for years in Sacramento for higher education funding and opposed all UC tuition increases, all members of the UC system must communicate to the Regents that students cannot be treated as “customers.”</p>\n<p>“Now more than ever we have to provide that noise,” Larimore-Hall said. “Students, faculty members, staff, everyone in the University community, has to make their voice loud and clear to Sacramento, that not this time! This time, you don’t get to treat students as customers and cash cows. This time we need to tell the Regents no, absolutely not!”</p>\n<p>According to Robert Samuels, lecturer at UCLA and president of the University Council-American Federation of Teachers, a union representing librarians and non-Senate faculty in the UC system, tuition could actually increase up to nine percent per year, depending on how much funding the UC system receives from the state.</p>\n<p>“If you actually look at the plan that the office of the president presented, it says that there will be a maximum of 5 percent increases if the state gives 4 percent,” Samuels said. “Well, the governor, in his last budget, it clearly says if UC raises tuition, they lose four percent. So, it is possible that tuition will go up nine percent every year for five years. The plan that was presented is not predictable; it’s not sustainable.”</p>\n<p>However, according to the UC Office of the President, the tuition increase plan actually stipulates a maximum possible increase of five percent annually for five years, depending on the level of state contributions to UC.</p>\n<p>“The new long-term stability plan for tuition and financial aid would guarantee that tuition would not increase by more than 5 percent annually for five years, provided the state maintains its current investment commitment,” the UCOP Long-Term Funding Plan press release states. “The state could also choose to provide additional funds to cover tuition revenue, allowing UC to reduce or lower the tuition and fee increases proposed in this plan.”</p>\n<p>But Samuels said many students are not paying tuition due to Pell Grants, Cal Grants and institutional aid, and thus it is within reason for tuition to be free, as long as the rest of the funding the school receives is used appropriately.</p>\n<p>“We have to make sure that the money that comes from the state, and the money that comes from your tuition, actually ends up in the classroom,” Samuels said. “What we’ve seen in the last 10 years is tuition keeps on going up and classes get bigger. There’s fewer graduate student instructors, there’s less personal attention for the students, there’s more multiple choice exams. The quality of education has gone down.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58706\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58706\" data-attachment-id=\"58706\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/protesters-convene-in-storke-plaza-for-rally-on-tuition/protests-on-ucsb-by-stephen-manga_for-11-21-2014-7438/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438.jpg?fit=1600%2C1017&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1017\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416451771\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Protests on UCSB by Stephen Manga_for 11.21.2014-7438\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438.jpg?fit=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438.jpg?fit=888%2C565&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58706\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438-1024x650.jpg?resize=500%2C312\" alt=\"Protesters chant outside of Cheadle Hall after a rally against UC tuition increase that took place Thursday in Storke Plaza.

External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh said students can do more than just rally to protest the tuition increase and that lobbying directly to legislators can be an effective form of action.</p>\n<p>“Student activism not only entails protesting as most people think, but also getting spot at the table with decision-making,” Singh said in an email. “Students need to work together on efforts, like lobbying legislators, because they need to see us people they were elected to serve. This happens with human interaction. Fortunately, Associated Students has a Lobby Corps, and I’m sure with my office collaborating, we will all be busy this year.”</p>\n<p>Singh, who attended the UC Regents meeting on Wednesday, said he learned that working with professors can increase the chances of lowering tuition costs, because students and professors are part of the same system.</p>\n<p>“They too are affected by the quality of their work based on tuition increase and class enrollment,” Singh said in an email. “The human interaction from a professor is lost in a large classroom, and instead it feels more like professor spewing information at us instead of active and engaging learning. And they know this.”</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, a third-year sociology major and rally organizer, said the tuition increases represent a failure of the state to support higher education. Mirza said he blames UC President Janet Napolitano for not exploring options other than raising tuition and said Brown has not prioritized higher education funding.</p>\n<p>“We are tired of public higher education coming at a private price,” Mirza said. “We are here because UC funding is too low a priority. We are not here to play political games of Jan Napolitano and Jerry Brown.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58709\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58709\" data-attachment-id=\"58709\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/protesters-convene-in-storke-plaza-for-rally-on-tuition/protests-on-ucsb-by-stephen-manga_for-11-21-2014-7475/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475.jpg?fit=1600%2C950&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,950\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416452272\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Protests on UCSB by Stephen Manga_for 11.21.2014-7475\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475.jpg?fit=250%2C148&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475.jpg?fit=888%2C527&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58709\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475-1024x608.jpg?resize=500%2C292\" alt=\"Protesters crowd the sixth floor of Cheadle Hall  as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael D.

Photo courtesy of <em>meddean.luc.edu</em></p></div>\n<h4>The same strain of meningitis that hit UCSB last year claims a life at SDSU</h4>\n<p>San Diego State University first-year pre-communication major Sara Stelzer died last Friday after contracting a strain of meningococcal meningitis.</p>\n<p>Last Tuesday, Stelzer was admitted to a nearby San Diego hospital for flu-like symptoms, which later turned out to be a case of meningococcal meningitis, according to a statement released by SDSU. Stelzer was infected by meningococcal meningitis serogroup B, the same strain contracted by four students at UCSB, according to multiple San Diego news sources such as U-T San Diego, UC San Diego’s the Guardian and NBC San Diego.</p>\n<p>Vice President of Student Affairs at SDSU Eric Rivera released a statement on Stelzer’s death on Friday.</p>\n<p>“We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our students to this terrible illness,” Rivera stated. “After speaking with her family, we know that Sara was a vibrant young woman who loved San Diego State, her friends and the time she spent at our university.  It is always difficult when a young life is lost, especially when that person is part of our SDSU family.”</p>\n<p>Meningococcal meningitis serogroup B is a rare, lethal disease that attacks the outer lining of the brain. Although there is no currently approved vaccination for serogroup B in the U.S., UCSB and Princeton University gained FDA approval to use the unlicensed vaccine, according to Student Health Director Mary Ferris.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB we obtained special permission earlier this year to offer a Meningococcal serogroup B vaccine that is licensed in Europe, Canada, Australia and Great Britain, but not in the USA,” Ferris said. “We were only allowed to give it to undergraduates in February and April, and now we are anxiously awaiting its approval so we can give it to more students.”</p>\n<p>Ferris said the bacteria is spread through direct and indirect physical contact.</p>\n<p>“It is thought to be spread through close contact with respiratory secretions via the mouth and nose, e.g. sharing cups, glasses and smoking materials and intimate mouth-to-mouth contact,” Ferris said in email. “It is not thought to be airborne.”</p>\n<p>According to Ferris, part of the reason this particular strain is so dangerous is because it rapidly attacks the human body.</p>\n<p>“It mainly attacks young healthy people and infants, and can be deadly within 24 hours. Once the bacteria gets in the bloodstream or spinal and brain fluid, it seems to overwhelm the immune system before your body has a chance to fight it off,” Ferris said, “For survivors the complications are often severe, such as brain damage, skin damage and even amputations because the infection impairs circulation.”</p>\n<p>Student Health Advice Nurse Holly Smith said Student Health is accepting students that want the vaccine.</p>\n<p>“We do have the meningococcal vaccine,” Smith said. “People can walk in daily and get that, if they request it first.”</p>\n<p>Smith also said the best way to avoid getting the disease is to stay informed about ways to contract and spread the disease.</p>\n<p>“We need to educate, educate, educate,” Smith said. “How does the disease spread, and how can I avoid getting it?”</p>\n<p>Both Ferris and Smith confirmed that once the serogroup B vaccination is available in the U.S., the university will be ordering and administering them as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/meningitis-b-strikes-at-sdsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/meningitis-b-strikes-at-sdsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/meningitis-b-strikes-at-sdsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/meningitis-b-strikes-at-sdsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/meningitis-b-strikes-at-sdsu/","id":3459,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3458,3457,3456],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/34"}},"__N_SSG":true}
