I like George. I like Bob. I’m glad that those are the two people who are appointed. I just, I had a dream of a more separate district,” Freeman said. “The appointment process allows leniency for people who weren’t even in Isla Vista on the district, and we’re lucky to have people like Bob Geis who has been around here for a long, long time, but who knows what could happen.”</p>\n<p>As for the university’s role in I.V. through the CSD, Director Thurlow said Chancellor Yang is focused on improving the area.</p>\n<p>“He is incredibly interested in making Isla Vista better,” Thurlow said. “It’s a priority for him.”</p>\n<p>Thurlow said he plans to work, in the short term, on an internship program for UCSB students to work directly with the CSD. Thurlow said the program would offer paid internships through private funding and would be conducted through the political science department.</p>\n<p>“I’m hopeful that that’s a program we can start right way in the spring with two interns and then have more interns in the summer.

id=\"caption-attachment-76068\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors met to discuss the extension of a festival ordinance to include this year’s Deltopia. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill would extend the ordinance from its current dates, which do not cover this year’s Deltopia. On the listed dates, the Santa Barbara County Code prohibits outdoor festivals or any similar musical activity, defined as music played at any location not built exclusively for that purpose such as a concert hall or music venue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current law sets an ordinance on April 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 and Oct. 26 through Nov. 4, but it does not cover this year’s Deltopia weekend, which will take place April 7, 8 and 9.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amendment to the ordinance was initially proposed by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office on Feb. 14 and would extend the days to include this year’s Deltopia as well as the following six years’ celebrations, including Halloween.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Supervisors meeting next week will determine the adoption of the bill. Board members must vote to pass the amendment, though it is likely to pass as all five members of the board voted in favor of setting the date for the hearing at Tuesday’s meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commander Kelly Moore of the Sheriff’s office spoke at the board meeting to discuss the amendment and said the previous two years’ Deltopia events saw much smaller crowds as a result of the festival ordinance. Commander Moore said the 2015 crowd was approximated to be 10,000 and the 2016 crowd was near 3,500, compared to 2014’s estimated 20,000 to 25,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several I.V. community members also spoke at the meeting, including I.V. Community Services District Director-elect Spencer Brandt, who said the festival ordinance is flawed but continues to be useful to law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The festival ordinance is an integral tool for the Sheriff’s Office and other partnering law enforcement agencies to make use of,” Brandt said. “While it is an imperfect solution, I see no reason why this policy shouldn’t be continued this year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Senate passed a resolution last week articulating the Senate’s position in favor of the amendment to the ordinance dates. Senator Batsheva Stoll, who authored the resolution, spoke at the board meeting to reiterate the Senate’s view on the ordinance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re in support of the ordinance as long as it’s being enforced on the day of Deltopia,” she said. “We want to make sure that, when it’s being enforced, it’s being enforced fairly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stoll said law enforcement’s presence at Deltopia could be a point of misunderstanding for students and stressed that police should work with campus organizations like UCIV to minimize potential conflict. UCIV is a volunteer organization at UC Santa Barbara that warns residents when they might be violating ordinances, connects students with medical services when needed and hands out free condoms and water during Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time, there can be miscommunications with students and law enforcement, so we urge [law enforcement] to work with organizations like UCIV that volunteer to help students understand the law and kind of work as sort of a middleman to ensure that everything runs smoothly on Deltopia,” Stoll said. </span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-75915\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of County of Santa Barbara</em></p></div>\n<p>The reservoir, which provides approximately 85 percent of the water for south county residents, now holds 82,011 acre-feet of water — a significant increase from the 34,576 acre-feet it held last Wednesday. This still accounts for less than half of the lake’s maximum storage: 193,305 acre-feet.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Flood Control District reported that the lake was at 17.9 percent capacity last week and at 7.3 percent capacity on Oct. 1 of last year.</p>\n<p>In light of the six-year statewide drought, the United States Bureau of Reclamation said in October 2015 that the Goleta Water District should “expect no new water from the lake.”</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District declared mandatory water use restrictions in May 2015 when it declared a Stage III Water Shortage Emergency with plans to reduce water usage by 35 percent across the district.</p>\n<p>This type of emergency is declared when the district’s water supply is 65 to 75 percent what it should normally be at that time of the year.</p>\n<p>Drought conditions may improve with recent rainfall, as Santa Barbara County is among the regions most affected by the recent drought period.</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties are the only areas still in an extreme drought stage, referred to as D3. The rest of the state is mostly in abnormally dry conditions, D0, with a large portion of Northern California no longer in drought.</p>\n<p>It is possible that Santa Barbara County could be lifted out of D3 range after last week’s rain spells.</p>\n<p>While the rain could offset the county’s drought, it also may cause potential infrastructure problems, as last week’s storm resulted in sinkholes, mudslides and severe flooding.</p>\n<p>Tom Fayram, deputy director of Water Resources at the Public Works Department in the county, said he is not concerned about the infrastructure at Cachuma Dam but recognized that last week’s intense rain could cause problems for roadways and flood control systems.</p>\n<p>“I have no concern over Cachuma Dam,” Fayram said. “If we get future rainfall of the magnitude of the rain we got just before last weekend, then we do have serious infrastructure concerns in terms of our transportation system, our roadways, our flood control system, [and] in terms of our channels and basins that do tend to be stressed in storms like that.”</p>\n<p>Fayram, whose department works in contracting the water from Lake Cachuma, said last week’s rains greatly contributed to the reservoir’s water supply, which will provide water to the entire south coast including Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“We still don’t know yet how much water actually will be available out of this,” Fayram said.  “There [are] a number of factors that go into it, but clearly this was a welcome shot in the arm, so to speak, of water that we just haven’t seen for the last five years.”</p>\n<p>As for how this rainfall will affect water restrictions in Goleta, KK Holland from the Goleta Water District said she is “cautiously optimistic” given the recent storm activity.</p>\n<p>“The Board is not currently considering additional restrictions,” Holland said in an email.<br>\nFayram said he welcomes the rain and capacity increase, but long-term solutions are necessary to solve the drought problem.</p>\n<p>“We still have a lake that’s at 50 percent capacity and can go back down to the same conditions we were in before,” Fayram said. “I don’t think that even filling the lake completely would solve our water supply issues because we started off with a lake in 2011 completely full, and five years of drought put us into a very dire situation.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75953\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75953\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/","id":3920,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3919,3918,3917],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"County To Apply for Grant for I.V.

Community Services District (CSD), spoke at the meeting, saying the center has great potential to help I.V.</p>\n<p>“There are so many potential uses for the facility, and it can truly benefit the culture of Isla Vista, providing an outlet and a venue for positive activity,” he said.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, an I.V. resident since 2011 and board director for the I.V. Community Development Corporation (IVCDC), spoke during public comment to thank board members who have previously supported I.V.’s attempts to establish the community center.</p>\n<p>“From the abolition of the development agency to the granting of $485,000 in support of critical renovations to the building, the board has proven a steady ally to the sizable community of Isla Vista,” he said. “For that you have our appreciation.”</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock went on to list the possible uses for the building if the grant was acquired and funds were allocated to the center.</p>\n<p>“I believe all the residents will benefit from the sense of knowledge and community that comes from classes such as dancing or cooking or by sweating out the stresses of work and studying during live music shows,” he said.</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock also suggested the space could be used to host private events for a variety of members in the community, including quinceañeras and sorority and fraternity events.</p>\n<p>Skip Grey, assistant director of the Santa Barbara County General Services Department, is working on the application for the grant. Grey said that the grant will specifically be used for the I.V. Community Center.</p>\n<p>Grey said his department began working on this grant in December, and the application has already been completed. The Board of Supervisors’ motion Tuesday now authorizes Grey to submit the paperwork. He said the application is complete and due to the state on Feb. 23.</p>\n<p>According to Grey, the grant is competitive and is not awarded automatically. The winners of the grant are expected to be announced by June 30.</p>\n<p>General Services partnered with the County Community Services Department to complete the application because of its authority over affordable housing programs. General Services will perform the renovations on the community center if the funding is approved, though the two departments worked together to complete the request for funding.</p>\n<p>I.V. qualified for the grant due the number of affordable housing units built in recent years.<br>\n“Specifically, the grant rewards cities and counties that approve affordable housing programs and the County of Santa Barbara has done a good job of that,” Grey said.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, IVCDC and CSD board member, was not in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting but spoke to the Nexus on Monday to describe possible uses for the grant.</p>\n<p>If the grant was used to renovate the community center, Brandt said possible renovations could include replacing the roof of the building, creating a shade structure and possibly installing a garage-door-like opening on the side of the community center so that events could be held outdoors and indoors simultaneously.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75795\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75795\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/","id":4435,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4434,4433,4432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Woman Sexually Assaulted on Estero Road","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ivfp.jpg?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ivfp.jpg?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1","description":"A woman was reportedly sexually assaulted in Isla Vista on Saturday, according to a university crime alert Sunday from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A woman was reportedly sexually assaulted in Isla Vista on Saturday, according to a university crime alert Sunday from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police said the assault occurred when a woman who was lost walked into a residence on the 6700 block of Estero Road Saturday afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to police, a male subject assaulted a woman at the residence that afternoon between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The woman was able to leave with the help of some friends, police said, and she reported the sexual assault to the I.V.

She said the university hopes to end construction in June.</p>\n<p>Sue Hawkins, director of UCen Dining services, confirmed the project is ongoing, but said the university’s standard approval process has delayed the store’s opening.</p>\n<p>Hernandez also said the contracts between the university and Starbucks have required several drafts because “the campus is extremely careful in the execution of all contracts.” She added that the contract with Starbucks went through several iterations.</p>\n<p>Marc Fisher, associate vice chancellor for campus design and facilities, said an important part of the review was a comparison to similar contracts between Starbucks and at other UC campuses.</p>\n<p>The process was extended longer than anticipated, but he also said the university is now ready to bid for construction.</p>\n<p>As for the new Starbucks’ appearance, Fisher said the store will be consistent with other locations.<br>\n“The design of our store is custom, but very much a Starbucks image and layout,” Fisher said in an email. “Starbucks, as you know, strives to provide a high quality product in an environment that is consistent with their brand.”</p>\n<p>As reported by the Nexus in May, the UCen is facing financial trouble and will look to the new Starbucks location to alleviate some of the building’s economic burden.</p>\n<p>In May of 2016, the Nexus <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/officials-new-starbucks-to-aid-struggling-ucen/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that the UCen had a year-end deficit of nearly $750,000.

While the two DJs often play music from foreign countries, this Tuesday’s show focused on Muslim rappers in particular.</p>\n<p>KCSB FM is the “perfect platform” for a show dedicated to resistance through the arts, Horne said.</p>\n<p>“Our whole ethos as a station is community radio representing sounds, music, opinions and values that you are not going to hear on commercial radio or in any other forms of media today,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Horne, hip-hop has been a symbol of dissent, revolution and change, as well as subverting what is expected from communities that have been brutalized by the dominant cultures.</p>\n<p>The two KCSB DJs chose music that tackles political unrest.</p>\n<p>The “Fire + Ice” hosts featured Libyan rapper Volcano’s single “Sawt Al Shaab,” and said his music video depicts the rapper singing in front of firing tanks while wearing golden chains and camouflage-patterned, oversized hoodies.</p>\n<p>Horne and Bernick, who goes by “DJ LenaBanga,” said “gangster imagery” is co-opted in the music video, modeled after the Western hip-hop scene.</p>\n<p>The DJs said the use of camouflage in the music video takes on a new meaning when placed in the context of a Middle East war zone.</p>\n<p>“The video, he shot it in a war zone in Benghazi. What’s really interesting going on in this video is a co-opting of gangster rap imagery. So, Volcano, he’s decked out in oversized hoodies, baggy camo pants, got the guns blaring, chain heavy,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>“The camo and the guns take on another meaning, but … we can apply that back to the origins of gangster rap here in the U.S. in the war zones that exist within our own cities,” he said.</p>\n<p>“He’s in a war zone, and these things are also very real,” Bernick said.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s radio show primarily played songs in foreign languages, such as Arabic and Farsi.</p>\n<p>The DJs chose Tuesday night’s artists because they have considerable followings in the countries they come from, though they recognize that certain regions lack large hip-hop fan bases.</p>\n<p>“Iran has a pretty large hip-hop scene compared to some places like Yemen or Libya,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>Bernick and Horne also said the artists’ skepticism toward government was similar to the duo’s own.</p>\n<p>“We think a healthy dose of criticism and skepticism towards the state is really, really necessary for us to keep going with a sense of freedom that resembles what we know it to be,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>DJ Frank Discussion and DJ LenaBanga’s show can be heard on KCSB FM 91.9, or streamed live on <em>live.kcsb.org</em>, on Tuesday nights from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/","id":2430,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2429,2428,2427],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Regents Address Tuition","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-18-at-2.27.21-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-18-at-2.27.21-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UC Board of Regents met in San Francisco Wednesday to discuss a proposal to raise tuition for the first time since 2011.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UC Board of Regents met in San Francisco Wednesday to discuss a proposal to raise tuition for the first time since 2011.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano presented in early January the proposal to raise tuition by 2.5 percent for the 2017-18 academic year. In-state tuition has remained at $11,220 since the 2011-12 academic year, and this proposed hike will increase tuition by $282.</p>\n<p>During the public forum, the Regents received several remarks on the tuition increase, which will be voted on during Thursday morning’s meeting. Commenters also critiqued some of the logistical problems with the UC’s intended expansion, as the UC intends to enroll an additional 10,000 students over the next three years.</p>\n<p>Susan Willats, an employee at UC Santa Cruz for 30 years, said the University’s increased student population has caused practical issues for the school, as the amount of students it admitted increased in the fall.</p>\n<p>“Because there was neither time nor funding to create a corresponding increase in infrastructure, we have far exceeded our resources,” she said.</p>\n<p>Several double rooms have been converted into triples, she said, and the residential lounges have been eliminated to provide more bed space, leaving students with not enough spaces to study.</p>\n<p>“This over-enrollment has not only added to the unsustainable workload of faculty and staff, but it has absolutely diminished the quality of the educational experience that the university provides,” Willats said.</p>\n<p>While concerns over growth were prevalent at the public forum, many also chose to focus on the upcoming vote on Thursday to increase tuition. President of the Council of UC Faculty Associations (CUCFA) and UCSF Professor Stanton Glantz was among several who spoke out against the decision.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate the fact that it costs money to run this place and the only real two places to get it is from the taxpayers or from the students and their families,” he said. “It’s very disappointing that you are going to be continuing Arnold Schwarzenegger’s failed policy of privatization which has generated over $12 billion in student debt since 2000.”</p>\n<p>Glantz also mentioned a report endorsed by faculty, students and staff organizations from all across UC, CSU and the community colleges that shows “the effect of the privatization and the fact that this could be fixed.” He held up the report at the public forum and encouraged that Regents use it to reform the current tuition system.</p>\n<p>Undergraduate students as well as faculty spoke at the forum. One UC Riverside undergraduate student criticized the tuition hike, saying the UC system takes pride in its “pillars of accessibility, affordability and quality” but is “sorely deficient” on all three. She said students’ wages could not be expected to cover rising costs.</p>\n<p>“If we place the burden of the cost of education on students who aren’t able to make above minimum wage on a part-time income to supplement the tuition costs that are already increasing, how do we reasonably expect any of them to be able to afford the increasing costs that you are trying to implement now?” she said.</p>\n<p>Alex Lee, the president of Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD), also asked the Regents to reject the proposed hike.</p>\n<p>“We as UC students are constantly the ones being harmed and taxed … I ask you, the Regents, to seek alternative sources of funding as well as maximize the money we currently have by cutting unnecessary expenses at the campus level and prioritize the educational experience,” Lee said. “On behalf of UC Davis and UC students, I ask you not to raise tuition.”</p>\n<p>In reference to tomorrow’s tuition vote, Monica Lozano, the chair of the board, said she looks forward to tomorrow’s discussion in action.</p>\n<p>The Regents plan to vote on the contentious issue of tuition hikes on Thursday morning after another session of public comment.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

She emphasized that her appointment will focus on creating a transparent system to address Title IX reports.</p>\n<p>She and UC President Janet Napolitano will be working together closely, according to a press release from the UCOP.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Salvaty said, “I think that the president’s recommendations, those that she’s adopted, are right on … I think we share the same goal, which is to improve accountability and fairness and transparency.”</p>\n<p>The recommendations, which are available on the UC website and are approved by UC President Napolitano, outline plans to make examining Title IX cases uniform.</p>\n<p>The document lists the creation of a proper investigation method for matters of sexual violence and sexual harassment. It states that Title IX will create “clear time frames” so that investigations take no longer than three months and adjudication takes no longer than two months unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”</p>\n<p>In reference to the implementation of uniform Title IX procedures, Salvaty acknowledged that the challenge in creating consistent processes will be respecting the unique qualities of each campus.</p>\n<p>“I think the consistent challenge, certainly in the context of our students, is trying to implement a fair process that all the students understand, that they feel comfortable accessing if that’s their choice,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>The UC’s recommendations insist on uniform procedures for handling Title IX cases, which Salvaty said are meant to create an equitable way of handling cases.</p>\n<p>“We are one system, we are one UC, and certainly the president and I would want all our students to experience the most fair process that we can build,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>“A key to that would be that that process looks the same on every campus,” she added. “It wouldn’t be fair if a student at UC San Diego experienced the Title IX process totally different than a student at Santa Cruz.”</p>\n<p>As a new presidency brings changes to federal administration, there is uncertainty whether the Obama administration’s interpretation of Title IX will be upheld. The current standard relies on the relatively lenient “preponderance of evidence,” 50.1 percent chance that the accused is responsible.</p>\n<p>In response to these changes, Salvaty says that the “obligation to take care of our students remains,” regardless of new administration.</p>\n<p>“I think we all agree that no one wants their students experiencing sexual violence. The question is: How do we build a fair process where we can ensure that we’re taking care of all of our students?” she said. “I don’t see the incoming administration changing … that fundamental obligation that the universities have.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74978\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74978\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/salvaty-to-be-title-ix-coordinator/","id":3601,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3600,3599,3598],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Children’s Center Benefits From New Funds","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-1.23.29-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-1.23.29-PM.png?resize=623%2C412&ssl=1","description":"Surrounded by foam letters, cubbies and a model igloo, kids at the Children’s Center in Goleta painted their names with colored ice cubes on Monday morning.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Surrounded by foam letters, cubbies and a model igloo, kids at the Children’s Center in Goleta painted their names with colored ice cubes on Monday morning.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74749\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74749\" data-attachment-id=\"74749\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/childrens-center-benefits-from-new-funds/ivyp-by-jose-ochoa-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-1-e1517328867725.jpg?fit=850%2C567&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"850,567\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ivyp-by-jose-ochoa-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-1-e1517328867725.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-1-e1517328867725.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74749\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-1-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Children at IVYP's Children Center are relaxing on the carpet.

The purpose of this new online tool is to reduce the amount of low priority calls. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Citizen Online Reporting system, as the Sheriff’s Office has named the software, is accessible through their website, sbsheriff.org, under the title “File an Online Report” on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Kelly Hoover, the public information officer for the County Sheriff’s Office, said the idea for the service was well-researched and that several deputies have worked to bring it into fruition.</p>\n<p>“We have deputies who research and selected the Cop Logic program and went through the process of researching what it would take to bring it to Santa Barbara County … and went through all the logistics to make it happen,” she said.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this new online tool is to reduce the amount of low-priority phone calls.</p>\n<p>In a press release Monday morning, Hoover said the “around-the-clock accessibility” will enable residents to “file a report at a time that is convenient to them without waiting for a deputy to respond or call them back.” Reportable incidents include identity theft, vandalism and stolen property, as well as civil complaints such as animal complaints, harassment via telephone and child custody violations.</p>\n<p>Hoover said this will give the deputies who normally file these incidents time to investigate other pressing instances of crime, as the software is meant to streamline the activities of police, “especially during a time when resources are limited.”</p>\n<p>The Sheriff’s Office plans to focus more of its time on investigating trends in crime rather than filing reports which individuals themselves are able to submit.<br>\n“It just cuts back on the amount of time the deputy is working on paperwork that could be filled out by the citizen,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>She said the site is intuitive, but one problem that users might encounter is failing to understand the law enforcement’s jurisdiction when reporting a crime. Police cannot see to a crime that is outside of its legal capacity, as its system distinguishes on its web page. The Sheriff’s Office will not be investigating crimes outside of the county and encourages citizens to submit reports to their corresponding sheriff’s offices. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol office is located on 6504 Trigo Rd.</p>\n<p>For those unsure of how to file a report, the Sheriff’s Office has also created a video tutorial illustrating the process, which they have linked in the preface to their report submission software.</p>\n<p>As for the price of installing the online service, Hoover said the system cost $22,500 to install and that it will cost an additional $15,000 per year to keep running.</p>\n<p>Despite the online platform, officials say urgent offenses and situations must be reported directly with a 911 call.</p>\n<p>“The system is not designed to take the place of the deputy; if residents need to talk to a deputy, by all means we still want them to call,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The program is called Cop Logic, not top logic.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Though a significant amount of the country voted to put a woman in the highest office in the land, others are more concerned about what the candidate’s policies were.</p>\n<p>Eileen Boris, professor in the Department of Feminist Studies at UCSB, said feminist leaders are necessary, and while the gender of the president is significant, it is more important for there to be a feminist, in particular, in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>“I think it makes more of a difference [if] we have a feminist in the White House … It makes more of a difference not the embodiment of the person but the policies of a person,” Professor Boris said.</p>\n<p>As for what particular policies a feminist would bring into office, Boris said, a feminist in office will bring a commitment to what is often called the ‘working family dilemma,’ that is, how do we organize the relationship between getting a living and daily life.”</p>\n<p>In local politics, Joan Hartmann secured the Third District Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors seat on Tuesday, beating rival Bruce Porter 13,563 to 11,511.</p>\n<p>When asked whether Hartmann’s election to the board of supervisors would make a difference in the community, Boris seemed to summarize many of the general election’s prevailing tensions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74136\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1780941814\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74125\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74136\" data-attachment-id=\"74136\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/local-women-gain-power-in-government/hbj-by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hbj-by-jenny-luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74136\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=350%2C525\" alt=\"Hannah-Beth Jackson speaks to a supporter at the Democrat watch party Tuesday.

Stein was then introduced by Ben Manski, a Green Party member since 1990 who was Stein’s campaign manager for her 2012 presidential bid.</p>\n<p>Stein began by speaking about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would run through the land of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota. Contamination from the pipeline, she said, would be environmentally and culturally disastrous for the indigenous people.</p>\n<p>She added that a warrant is out for her arrest following her involvement in the protest at Standing Rock, prompting applause from a crowd of approximately 100 people.</p>\n<p>She focused mostly on environmental issues and the importance of voting for “the greater good, not the lesser of two evils,” and she frequently alluded to both the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates.</p>\n<p>Stein was well received by the moderately sized audience and several individuals frequently chanted Stein’s name and applauded for her speaking points.</p>\n<p>Commenting on Stein’s policy earlier this week in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>, Green Party Spokesman Mike Feinstein said it would be useless for Californians to vote Democratic in this election, given the state’s history of voting for Democratic leaders.</p>\n<p>“It’s a wasted vote if you’re a progressive and you’re voting for Hillary Clinton. You’re not gaining anything by doing that, on a policy basis,” Feinstein said.</p>\n<p>Per Hoel, a 32-year-old freelance videographer and local activist who attended the rally, was skeptical of her choice to focus primarily on the environment and other big ticket issues without delving fully into the issues with the two-party system.</p>\n<p>“I found the speech kind of underwhelming,” the rally attendee said. “I was expecting a reason to vote for her, not the things that I wanted to hear.”</p>\n<p>Mariah Clegg, a first-year sociology graduate student also in attendance at the rally, said she was undecided on whether to vote for the Green Party candidate and expressed that at the moment she did not know what was best for the movement.</p>\n<p>“It’s important that progressives don’t split along this line of people who are voting for the lesser of two evils and people who are doing the righteous thing,” Clegg said.</p>\n<p>Because Stein could not be on stage with Democrat and Republican presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Sunday,  she live-streamed answers for the presidential debate at <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/9/27/expanding_the_debate_jill_stein_debates\" target=\"_blank\"><i>democracynow.org.</i></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73002\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-09/jill-stein-discusses-dakota-access-pipeline-environmental-issues-at-rally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73002\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-09/jill-stein-discusses-dakota-access-pipeline-environmental-issues-at-rally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-09/jill-stein-discusses-dakota-access-pipeline-environmental-issues-at-rally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-09/jill-stein-discusses-dakota-access-pipeline-environmental-issues-at-rally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-09/jill-stein-discusses-dakota-access-pipeline-environmental-issues-at-rally/","id":3910,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3909,3908,3907],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/86"}},"__N_SSG":true}
