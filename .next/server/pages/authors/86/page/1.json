He began his career in law enforcement in the Bay Area, later transferring to Inglewood and becoming a police chief for Moscow, Idaho, where he oversaw the city and the University of Idaho. He was also the chief of police for the City of Lompoc in 1995.</li>\n<li>Lt. Hsueh has worked in SBSO for 31 years. He’s led initiatives to provide officers trainings on responding to people with mental illness and trained over 700 officers in two years.

Eddie Hsueh and Lt. Brian Olmstead discuss police-resident relations and sexual assault policies in Isla Vista. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Responding to Cases of Sexual Assault in I.V.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said officers should treat survivors with dignity and compassion, as if they were members of their own family. The department does not have a single rape kit that has not been processed, Brown said.</li>\n<li>Hsueh said SBSO could benefit from referring victims to both Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, formerly the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, and UCSB’s Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education, as well as implementing green dot and implicit bias training. Green dot training teaches people to be an active bystander in preventing sexual assault.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said he believes law enforcement could provide more education to the public about where victims can report sexual assault cases, as jurisdictional issues can be confusing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Police-Resident Relations During Large Events in I.V. </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said future large events in I.V. such as Deltopia should only be for local community members because the majority of crime and citations during these events are linked to people from out of town.</li>\n<li>Hsueh suggested SBSO work with the CSD to create sanctioned events that minimize crime through crisis stabilization units and through triaging those suffering from alcohol and drug abuse. Hsueh has been on the “front lines” of riots and said police often did not act in accordance with their training because they did not give ample notice before using their weapons.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said more alcohol-free daytime events could decrease the rates of crime and medical transports because alcohol is a main source of problems during I.V. events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All three candidates unanimously expressed support for medical amnesty for overdose victims and those suffering from alcohol and substance abuse.</p>\n<p>Hsueh, in particular, expressed support for written policies that would show the public that the department’s emphasis is to protect their lives. Under these new policies, those seeking medical attention for illegal activities like drug use or underage drinking would not be arrested.</p>\n<p><strong>Candidates’ Perspective on I.C.E. Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown, who has previously complied with I.C.E.’s requests, said he would continue to comply with requests to give the agency the release dates of violent criminals.</li>\n<li>Hsueh was the only of three candidates to state that he would stop complying with I.C.E.’s orders, which he said was necessary to improve “public trust.”</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the immigration system currently needs “comprehensive reform” but said the department needs to follow the law and focus on removing violent people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Concerns Over SBSO Lack of Personnel</strong></p>\n<p>The three candidates said one of the department’s pressing needs is its lack of personnel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said the department has lost approximately 90 positions funded through the county’s general fund since 2008. He said the department has cut programs in non-emergency areas and lost several specialized units and crime prevention programs, but he hopes to bring back those programs incrementally.</li>\n<li>Hsueh agreed with Brown’s position.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the county has paid $4.5 million in overtime as a result of vacancies. He said SBSO currently needs to fill 50 funded positions, including approximately 30 sworn officers. He said the department currently lacks a recruitment plan for completing the new hirings.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83342\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83342\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/","id":3756,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3755,3754,3753],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Suspect Arrested for Assault With a Deadly Weapon","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2018-05-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ucpd.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ucpd.jpg?resize=449%2C449&ssl=1","description":"The suspect argued with the staff and “brandished” a knife when approached.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A suspect was arrested under a charge of assault with a deadly weapon after he brandished a knife to an apartment complex staff member in Isla Vista, resulting in a dispute that caused minor injuries.</p>\n<p>The incident occurred at about 7:50 p.m. on Saturday when the UC Police Department received a report from a Tropicana Gardens staff member of a resident “acting strangely,” according to an alert sent out by the UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD).</p>\n<p>The suspect was identified as 29-year-old Whari Lewis, according to Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) arrest records.</p>\n<p>The suspect argued with the staff and “brandished” a knife when approached.

The tax would add an additional 8 percent surcharge to five utilities on I.V. residents’ bills: electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services.</p>\n<p>In a report presented at a special meeting on Tuesday, the Community Services District (CSD) presented its first revenue projections. The CSD arrived at the figures by calculating eight percent of all I.V. bills in 2017 for the five utilities.</p>\n<p>Dividing that amount by the number of I.V. residents, 23,096 <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217\">according to the 2010 census</a>, means that individuals will each have to pay approximately $30.41 annually.</p>\n<p>The tax figures originally projected the CSD would accrue $834,993, though additional deductions the CSD is still considering would drop the number to $702,444.</p>\n<p>There are two specific deductions the CSD is considering: a state-owned exemption which amounts to $7,300 and a low-income exemption which totals $125,249 of tax savings for residents.</p>\n<p>A low-income exemption would excuse residents from paying the 8 percent tax on gas, water and electricity.</p>\n<p>Residents would be able to qualify for the exemption by providing proof they are enrolled in the California Alternate Rates for Energy or Family Electric Rate Assistance programs. They would also need proof they own the electricity utility account enrolled in the assistance program.</p>\n<p>In order to apply for the exemption, residents would have to file an application with the general manager of the CSD.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://sbcassessor.com/SampleballotandpollplaceLookup/ballots/bt000009.pdf\">the language readers will see at the </a>voting booth, the tax revenue will be used to fund “local improvements to parking, public safety, lighting, and sidewalks.”</p>\n<p>The language also states that the funds will be used to provide tenant-landlord mediation services, create a municipal advisory council and operate community facilities and events such as the I.V. Community Room at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar or the I.V. Community Center, both of which are behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>The ballot language originally claimed that the tax would accrue $642,000 in funds a year, though the CSD’s preliminary estimate is higher.<strong>  </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82998\" style=\"width: 1008px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1237702627\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83018\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82998\" data-attachment-id=\"82998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/measure-r/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=998%2C324&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"998,324\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure r\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=888%2C288&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82998\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=888%2C288\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Above, a summary of the Isla Vista Community Services District’s revenue sources from the CSD’s Tuesday special meeting report.

White, the university system’s chancellor since 2012, said he believes it in California’s “best interest” to provide “sufficient” funding to its 23 campuses across the state. White said in light of the state’s families should not be “saddled” with more financial burdens in order to get a higher education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to CSU, lack of funding from the state prompted the decision to maintain tuition at the current rate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSU sought a budget increase of $263 million in November to fund its graduation initiative, higher enrollment, employee compensation, healthcare and retirement costs, and infrastructure needs. Governor Jerry Brown’s January budget proposal provided approximately a third of that funding with only $92.1 million allocated, prompting discussions over tuition increases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor White’s statement says “that proposal will not be considered further this year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday’s statement said the chancellor has been working with campus presidents and other university leaders to speak with policymakers about prioritizing CSU and public higher education in the next state budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins said she “pledge[d]” to work with the legislature to lower barriers and costs of higher education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assembly Speaker and former ex officio member of the CSU board of trustees Anthony Rendon said CSU has a “strong case for additional funding” in the legislature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The California State University (CSU) system was created in 1960 and is the largest system of “senior higher education” with a total enrollment of 484,000 students and a faculty of 50,800, according to CSU’s website. Its website claims it is renowned for producing job-ready graduates and innovative research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Half of its students transfer from California Community Colleges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the university’s website, the California State University (CSU) system is retaining, graduating and enrolling students at record levels and currently awards over 110,000 degrees annually with 3.4 million alumni across its system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California (UC) system recently announced it would </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-31/uc-president-wants-guaranteed-admission-to-all-qualified-ccc-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">admit all qualified community college students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who choose to transfer to any of their 9 undergraduate campuses.

multipurpose room to discuss current and future UC Santa Barbara mascots. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 20 students gathered at the Student Resource Building’s multipurpose room to discuss their issues with UCSB’s current mascot, the gaucho, or an Argentinian cowboy. Students expressed concern that UCSB negatively represents Argentinian people by using caricaturesque features like a mask and grimacing face on “Olé,” the mascot that appears at UCSB sports matches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ani Vahalia, second-year biology major, said during the town hall that explaining the university’s current mascot to other people is “really awkward” because it appears to be representing a “racial trope.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vahalia said that, considering a significant part of the student population is Hispanic, the problems with Olé and UCSB’s tradition of throwing tortillas at soccer games are “kind of obvious.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why is that our mascot? Is it any better than… the Redskins?… A lot of our student population are people of color who have dealt with slurs and awkward representation,” Vahalia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hailey Phelan, a fourth-year global studies major and one of the event’s organizers, said that many people have recommended replacing the gaucho with a raccoon, but said the word “raccoon” itself can contain a slur which could also become problematic in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"http://www.ucsbgauchos.com/fan_zone/Locos/nickname\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">university’s athletics website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the university settled on the gaucho as its nickname in 1936 after the female student population voted to change the mascot from the roadrunner because of the 1927 film “The Gaucho.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1980s, “Gaucho Joe” became an iconic figure in cheering on the team at basketball games, and in the 1990s basketball fans became famous for throwing tortillas on the court during games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the athletics website, the tortillas “often stopped </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">play and resulted in technical foul calls against the Gauchos.” In 1997, UCSB’s basketball coach was ejected from a game against the University of the Pacific after failing to control the tortilla-throwing crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student showed support for the current mascot and said he does not see the gaucho as an offensive figure, but rather a symbol of values from a distinct set of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cristian Zapata, a third-year biopsychology major, said that as someone of Argentinian heritage, he does not believe the gaucho is “racist.” Zapata said gauchos are a group of people “represent[ing] freedom and virility” and should be seen as a unique subculture — a group of people who chose not to adapt to modern lifestyles and live in the rural countryside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said that the name Olé is fitting for UCSB because the commonly-used phrase is a part of the prominent soccer culture in both Argentina and the university. Zapata said that gauchos eat a form of bread similar to the tortilla, making UCSB’s sports tradition very fitting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leanne Friedrich, a graduate student studying materials in the engineering department, said regardless of whether the mascot is verifiably “racist,” students’ interpretation of the mascot as such is “completely distracting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phelan suggested the possibility of keeping the gaucho as a mascot but rebranding its imagery to be historically accurate by dressing the mascot in appropriate clothing, perhaps portraying them on horseback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the main difficulties in changing UCSB’s mascot rest on the financial impact a rebranding could have on the university, specifically on its intercollegiate athletics departments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Phelan, the athletics department has said the university’s mascot needs to be intimidating to other sports teams, explaining Olé’s aggressive appearance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Samantha Stopol, a fourth-year economics major, said she believes the gaucho is a folk hero in South America and a proud figure but said she believes Olé should be redesigned because the mask he wears makes him look like a criminal and provides a negative image. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phelan also said many of the university’s online domains such as GauchoSpace would also need to be renamed and relicensed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the athletic and financial repercussions that a mascot change could have, Phelan noted that alumni feel an attachment to the Gaucho name, which should be considered when proposing a change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, Dean of Student ife, also spoke about student’s perception of the mascot and suggested students tie values they respect to the mascot, regardless of whether it is changed in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event’s organizers Phelan, Mario Infante, a fourth-year computer science major, and James Ferraro, a first-year history major, said they held Friday evening’s town hall in order to facilitate the discussion around the current mascot but were not advocating for a specific change.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ferraro is a first-year history major, not a history of public policy major. </em></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-82400\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Measure R, a new ballot measure proposed by the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD), would fund the fledgling government’s operations by imposing an eight percent tax on electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services. The ballot measure will be on Isla Vistans’ June 5, 2018, primary election ballot.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD was created on Nov. 9, 2016, after the passage of Measure E with an overwhelming 87 percent of the vote, but the new government was deprived of financial stability when Measure F failed to garner the necessary 66.67 percent of the vote, falling short by about six percent.</p>\n<p>Measure R is essentially a second attempt to pass a user utility tax (UUT), the same goal Measure F sought to accomplish in 2016. The ballot language for the measure has changed since the UUT’s first appearance at the polls, though only slightly.</p>\n<p>While on the 2016 ballot, Measure F included the contingency that the UUT would go into effect with the creation of a then-nebulous CSD. Measure R now lists the particular services the tax would fund.</p>\n<p>According to the ballot language registered with the county’s clerk-recorder, the UUT would explicitly fund any of the following services: improvements to parking, public safety, lighting and sidewalks.</p>\n<p>The tax could also be used to provide tenant mediation services, create a municipal advisory council and operate facilities like the Community Room the CSD currently meets at for its twice-monthly board meetings and the burgeoning Community Center.</p>\n<p>In order to place Measure R on the June primary ballot, the CSD Board of Directors first voted on the language citizens would see on their voting slips and then submitted the proposed question to the County of Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors, which later approved the phrasing at a board meeting.</p>\n<p>Since its creation, the CSD has found its organizational framework, hired legal counsel, expanded the Community Service Organization’s escort services, piloted a tenant mediation program with the Santa Barbara Legal Aid Foundation and hired an interim General Manager, all while operating mainly on a $200,000 donation from UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus </em>on Wednesday, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand said the key difference between the 2016 vote and this year’s is that the CSD has found its footing, proving it can do a lot with a little.</p>\n<p>Support for Measure R is mounting within student activist networks and some government circles. UC Santa Barbara’s Campus Democrats began campaigning for the measure last Monday, while the “Yes on Measure R” campaign has been active since mid-March.</p>\n<p>While the I.V. Recreation and Parks District has not made an official statement supporting the measure, Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann issued a statement on Wednesday “strongly in support” of Measure R. Hartmann has personally contributed $6,000 toward the campaign and will actively fundraise and canvass for its passage, she said.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said the measure’s passage would allow for the CSD to thrive and provide effective services to its unique demographic.</p>\n<p>“Due to its great density, diversity, poverty level, and demographics dominated by a young student population … Isla Vista has an even greater need for services and infrastructure than other unincorporated areas in the County,” Hartmann said in her statement.</p>\n<p>While proponents of the tax have sought to spread their message through door-to-door canvassing and tabling, opponents have voiced their displeasure toward the tax<sub>,</sub> primarily through flyers.</p>\n<p>Chuck Eckert, treasurer of anti-UUT group Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes, told the <em>Nexus</em> on Wednesday that the group has been distributing flyers advocating for a “no” vote on the measure.</p>\n<p>The flyers claim that I.V. residents’ taxes are far too high and calls on them to voice their dissent. The exact cost of the UUT for individual residents is still undetermined, according to CSD Secretary and Director Spencer Brandt. The CSD plans to present a revenue estimate at their next board meeting, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Eckert said he is against the measure’s passage because he believes the I.V. government does not need additional funding “to do what they have already done.” He also said services like tenant mediation duplicate already available services like the Community Housing Office and other resources offered by UCSB and the County of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The fire is currently 86 percent contained.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire surpassed the Cedar Fire that burned in San Diego County in October 2003. The Cedar Fire burned 273,246 acres, caused 15 deaths and destroyed 2,820 structures.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire is approximately 16 miles from UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The fire line from Ventura to Santa Barbara is “contained and secure” and fire officials do not expect the fire to progress further since wind speeds have slowed, according to a Cal Fire press release on Sunday.</p>\n<p>All mandatory and voluntary evacuations have been lifted in Santa Barbara County, with the exception of a voluntary evacuation warning on Highway 33 between Rose Valley north to Hartman Ranch.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire has caused the death of one firefighter and one civilian and has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged another 280.</p>\n<p>The blaze began on Dec. 4 and its cause is still under investigation, according to Cal Fire’s incident tracker.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents experienced <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/i-v-residents-out-of-power-for-three-hours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blackouts</a> the night the fire began and responded by flooding the streets of I.V., <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/watch-fireworks-and-couch-burnings-from-the-i-v-power-outage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">setting off fireworks and burning couches</a>.</p>\n<p>Air quality in Santa Barbara and Goleta improved to “good” after weeks of the “unhealthy” air quality that prompted Chancellor Henry T.

collaboration with the many organizations that currently provide different aspects of the dispute resolution process, including the Isla Vista Tenants Union, UC Santa Barbara’s Community Housing Office and others in the area.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (CSD) has not yet decided the program’s specifics but board members have called its creation a “top priority.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB3\">Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3)</a>, which paved the way for the I.V. CSD’s creation with its passage in 2015, provided the district the power to create a tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand gave a presentation about similar tenant mediation programs during the CSD’s Tuesday meeting and said I.V. residents have reached out for assistance with tenant-landlord mediation in the past.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents contacted the Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program for help 64 times in the 2014 to 2015 fiscal year. This is the highest usage rate of by an unincorporated area of the county and nearly double the rate of the community with the second highest usage, according to the presentation.</p>\n<p>Tenants reached out to the mediation program mostly for security deposit refunds, lease terminations, habitability and repair issues and rent increase disputes.</p>\n<p>IVTU provides education and advocacy for tenants and some case work for rental housing issues and the UCSB Community Housing Office provides some dispute resolution and mediation.</p>\n<p>The Legal Aid Foundation of Santa Barbara County also provides information about tenants’ rights and responsibilities, but there is yet to be a service that unites all areas of tenant-landlord issues for all residents.</p>\n<p>Bertrand compared mediation programs in the cities of Palo Alto and Santa Barbara to I.V., which he said has a need for a similar program considering the size of the population and its requests for help from tenant organizations.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Tuesday’s discussion was the board of directors’ first time discussing tenant-landlord mediation programs and said he hopes to discuss the program’s creation with other I.V. stakeholders as the board moves forward.</p>\n<p>If the CSD chooses, it can make its mediation program mandatory through an ordinance, though a majority of board members have said they would first like to create a successful voluntary program before mandating mediation for disputes.</p>\n<p>He said some tenant mediation programs passed by local governments have included provisions for mandatory mediation programs but believes public input is necessary before the CSD makes any program mandatory.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to learning more about the community’s desire for a tenant mediation program and ordinance … The purpose of last night’s presentation was to show examples of what other communities have done to bolster tenant protections,” Bertrand said in an email.</p>\n<p>Some board members have come out in favor of a mandatory tenant mediation program but also say the program must acquire funding and become effective before it can ever become mandatory.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board member Bob Geis said the district should fund the program through the user utility tax that the board is working to bring to the voters by next year.</p>\n<p>Board members are still debating the exact percentage of the tax that will go on next year’s ballot. The utility tax fell short of the 66 percent vote it needed last year, with 61.22 percent of the vote, when Measure F asked voters for an 8 percent tax on Nov. 8, 2016.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD board member and secretary, said a mediation program could create a difference in the way that landlords treat tenants.</p>\n<p>“Customer service to their tenants is not something that is prioritized or even needed because our rental housing market is just so — there’s no choice … There’s no places you can go if you don’t like your landlord,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He said a mandatory program similar to the city of Palo Alto’s could make landlords more responsive when it comes to repairs, security deposit issues and resolving other disputes.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor race, Bruce Porter, held an early lead in the voting booths, while news sources were reporting that the country’s new president would be inheriting a politically fractured nation.</p>\n<p>Democrats everywhere felt the sobering start of a new era with President Donald Trump’s election later that night, but Hartmann was supposed to be celebrating a milestone in her public service career — <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\">her appointment as a county supervisor</a>.</p>\n<p>Hartmann and Gina Fischer, a highly-involved staff member in Hartmann’s Isla Vista projects and representative for the Third District office, agree that the night of the election was a somber time. In response, Fischer said some constituents turned to Hartmann and local government to ease their dissatisfaction with national politics.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said the fact that her election coincided with Trump’s placed an additional responsibility on her office to listen to constituents and bring people together rather than divide them.</p>\n<p>Constituents from I.V. and UC Santa Barbara in particular would be expecting focused representation for their communities from Hartmann. When those precincts were counted, Hartmann’s votes took a significant jump.</p>\n<p>In return for their votes, Hartmann has had a busy and effective year working on I.V. infrastructure, public safety and support for the I.V. Community Services District, which has benefitted from donations from Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p>She has worked to get the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) off the ground, giving the newly-formed government start-up funds, leasing them the previous Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr’s office and giving them a space to provide programs in the community room of the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Because a large number of the county’s residents live in unincorporated areas, it is Hartmann’s responsibility to represent those constituents, making I.V.’s self-determination through the CSD even more important.</p>\n<p>“I am always scampering around from Guadalupe to Vandenberg Village to Los Alamos to Solvang to I.V. to here in Santa Barbara. So now I.V. has its own government, and to see that begin to take shape is really exciting,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>Fischer said Hartmann’s office is interested in “culturing conditions for [the] CSD to grow,” giving the new government an opportunity to represent its constituents in a way that might previously have been more difficult through the county.</p>\n<p>“We’re watching something very exciting be born and I’m delighted to be one of the midwives of many for that process,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board Chair Ethan Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday he’s had “nothing but good experiences” working with Hartman and her staff, saying she has always been attentive and willing to help constituents.</p>\n<p>“Without Supervisor Hartmann’s early support, we wouldn’t have been able to begin providing services so quickly,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s office contributed $3,000 from their discretionary funds in the last fiscal year and $2,000 in the current year, he said, which has helped the district in their start-up costs.</p>\n<p>Since its creation, the I.V. CSD has created an internship program in collaboration with UCSB’s Department of Political Science, managed scheduling for the community room and launched an expansion of the Community Service Organization’s escort program.</p>\n<p>The District has also developed a policy manual, hired legal counsel and acquired insurance, fulfilling critical steps in its formation.</p>\n<p>Bertrand expressed praise for Hartmann’s work in I.V. and said that the county’s infrastructure improvements have been especially helpful for her constituents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/\">The county Public Works Department installed a stoplight in August</a> at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte, citing a need to mitigate the amounts of collisions in the area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/\">The county also installed a sidewalk</a> on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road last spring.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Hartmann’s work on public safety issues through the I.V. Safe task force has helped people better understand the issues they are facing in the community through her focus on the data involved in these subjects.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said her office’s number one priority is to keep students safe and said she was pleased that this year’s Halloween weekend saw fewer arrests and medical transports.</p>\n<p>While Hartmann has focused on helping her constituents by attempting to support I.V.’s bid for self-governance through the CSD, a main focus of hers going forward will be helping the Community Center become a source for community programming for her diverse constituency.</p>\n<p>“We got a grant for $460,000 to add to money that the county had already invested in the community center, and then we had to delay opening the community center,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We expect to bring everybody in Isla Vista from different age groups, different ethnicities, different — not everyone will be students — and hope that we can create a stronger sense of belonging to the I.V. community,” she said.</p>\n<p>She said she also hopes to soon build a “pipeline” between UCSB and the county to bring students into the county.</p>\n<p>Despite what she said was a “steep learning curve” to the first year of her term, Hartmann said the work has been fun, and she has built connections with I.V. officials like Bertrand who have said working with her is a “true pleasure.”</p>\n<p>Constituents will continue to look for strong leadership in Hartmann and other local elected officials, as students and I.V. residents have shown that they are resistant to the changes occurring on the national level.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Most recycled water is non-potable, or unsafe for drinking. Non-potable water is used primarily for irrigation of plants not intended for consumption.</p>\n<p>The project will install “purple pipes,” a type of pipe that carries recycled water in an environmentally-conscious way. The project will stretch from Embarcadero Del Norte south to People’s Park, Perfect Park, Little Acorn Park and the nearby areas.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, the newly appointed IVRPD director, made the motion to authorize staff to work on the project at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock, a fourth-year sociology and economics double major, told the <em>Nexus</em> last Thursday that one of his goals as a director would be to install the infrastructure needed to provide recycled water.</p>\n<p>The recycled water project is a step toward fulfilling the promises IVRPD board members made when campaigning for “yes” on Measure O.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/budgets/17-18%20Approved%20Final%20Budget%20Formatted.pdf\">According to its budget</a>, the IVRPD estimates it will receive $256,358 in tax revenue because the measure passed in May.</p>\n<p>The parks district said earlier this year it would use the funds to address a “backlog of deferred maintenance” in its parks as well as bring reclaimed water to I.V.</p>\n<p>“Every single one of us has knocked on the door and said this is a thing we’ve wanted to do,” IVRPD Director Carlos López said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/board-agenda/agenda/2017/BrdAgenda%20October%2012%202017.pdf\">According to IVRPD’s Oct. 12 agenda</a>, the parks district asked the Goleta Water District if it would be interested in entering an agreement to provide stable water rates if the district chose to install purple pipes in the park.</p>\n<p>The water district said in an attachment to last week’s meeting agenda that the rates are determined by studies and that any agreement must comply with the current water rate, though reclaimed water cannot be charged at a higher rate than the cost for providing it.</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said investing in this type of water comes with risks because the rates could change at any moment or the water district could choose to stop offering recycled water.</p>\n<p>He reassured board members that the idea was likely “safe enough, but that there is no guarantee the rates will not change or that water will continue to be offered. Board members agreed and authorized the decision through a unanimous vote.</p>\n<p>At their meeting, the IVRPD also moved forward with a number of park improvement projects, including a new irrigation project for Sueno Park’s orchards and installing power to People’s Park to host bands and festivals.</p>\n<p>According to the board’s agenda, the project to bring irrigation to Sueno Park will cost approximately $5,700<strong>. </strong>Diane Dodds, a UC Santa Barbara alumnus, donated $2,000 to the project’s completion.</p>\n<p>The board also approved the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) to use their parks to host the newly-expanded Community Service Escort program. The service district’s board of directors voted to expand the program to increase safety in I.V. in September.</p>\n<p>The CSD will work with CSOs by setting up tents near highly-frequented areas on weekends so community service officers may provide escorts to anybody who requests service.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD board of directors meets every second Thursday of the month from 6 to 8 p.m. in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Cooperative.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article previously said the IVRPD would install potable water.
