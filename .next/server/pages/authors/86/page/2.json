The two parties began discussions to settle the lawsuit at the end of July. He ultimately filed to dismiss the lawsuit on Oct. 13, and the court accepted the dismissal on Oct. 16, according to the Santa Barbara County online court record database.</p>\n<p>In the lawsuit, Pragin alleges that the CSD’s Formation Committee discussed financial revenue, such as grants and donations, when it was only authorized to discuss the CSD’s financial structure, such as banking.</p>\n<p>A charter is a document listing what a committee may discuss during its meetings.</p>\n<p>Pragin said he set three conditions for dismissing the lawsuit during the negotiation process.</p>\n<p>The first is that the scope of the Formation Committee’s work be defined more clearly in its charter. According to the CSD’s lawyer G. Ross Trindle, the CSD addressed this concern by signing Resolution 17-1 on July 11 with a unanimous vote of the board.</p>\n<p>The resolution outlines the CSD subcommittees’ roles, including the Formation Committee.</p>\n<p>The resolution added the ability to find sources for funding to the committee’s powers.</p>\n<p>“That resolution, in my mind, addressed the … concerns that Mr. Pragin’s complaint attempted to raise,” Trindle said in an email.</p>\n<p>The second condition Pragin requested when dismissing the lawsuit is a statement from the board recognizing that they violated the Formation Committee’s initial charter.</p>\n<p>Trindle said the CSD plans to make a statement on the lawsuit at the next regularly scheduled board meeting on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>Pragin’s last request before dismissing the case was to recuperate the costs he suffered from the litigation.</p>\n<p>He said he spent approximately $1,200 pursuing the lawsuit against the district.</p>\n<p>Pragin dismissed the cases without receiving compensation; he lost eligibility to have his costs reimbursed when he decided to represent himself in the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>According to federal law, if a person representing themselves in court is not a lawyer they are unable to be awarded attorney’s fees if they win their case.</p>\n<p>Pragin told the <em>Nexus</em> he attempted to address the alleged violations at the Formation Committee’s public meeting but said all the committee members agreed he was incorrect in his claims against the district.</p>\n<p>He said he felt the committee did not take his claims seriously.</p>\n<p>“I stopped feeling like a constituent of theirs,” he said.</p>\n<p>Trindle said in an email he thought it was “unfortunate” that Pragin felt his only option was filing a lawsuit but said it is important that the district can now focus on improving I.V. for its residents.</p>\n<p>CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday evening that he and the other board members are committed to the importance of transparency and public participation.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman recused himself from all closed sessions discussing the lawsuit to avoid a possible conflict of interest stemming from his long-term friendship. Pragin also served as Freeman’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-14/three-final-candidates-join-race-for-office-in-isla-vista/\">“campaign philosopher”</a> for the 2016 Santa Barbara County Supervisor race.</p>\n<p>In addition to the lawsuit, Pragin said he has also served the district and its subcommittees with three letters citing violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act, the law that sets the rules for open meetings of government boards and the communications between board members.</p>\n<p>According to Pragin, two of the complaints were answered and corrected and one was answered and disputed.</p>\n<p>Two of the alleged violations were served in April and the other in May.</p>\n<p>One of his letters dated April 20 claimed the CSD illegally created an ad hoc committee by making a committee that discussed “continuing subject matter jurisdiction,” arguing that the contents the committee discussed made it ineligible to be ad hoc.</p>\n<p>Bertrand responded in a letter a month later saying the board rescinded the action that first created the ad hoc committee and passed a new motion that created it once more with a more fitting description of its powers.</p>\n<p>The second letter, also dated April 20, alleged directors George Thurlow and Bob Geis had a side conversation during a regular board meeting of the CSD to plan their next meeting of the Formation Committee.</p>\n<p>Geis, chair of the Formation Committee, disputed the claim in a letter stating the committee did not believe the action warranted a commitment to cease and desist and that such an action would lead to a “burdensome limitation.”</p>\n<p>The letter dated May 9 claimed members of the Formation Committee failed to publicly notice, adjourn or show up to a public meeting.</p>\n<p>Geis responded in a letter a week later stating the committee “unconditionally commits” to ceasing, desisting and refusing to repeat the offense Pragin stated in his letter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

goals. He said he chose to apply because he believes in I.V. self-governance and hopes to bring his experience in advocacy, lobbying, fundraising and “navigating bureaucracies” to the district.</p>\n<p>“I want to be general manager to make sure that the CSD is successful in its first year in establishing itself, establishing its role in the community, making relationships built in the community and having a good reputation as a voice for change and good change in I.V. and I feel like I am well-suited to do that,” he said in a phone interview with the <em>Nexus </em>Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Abboud, a 2014 UC Santa Barbara alumnus, also plans to strengthen the district’s finances and find an independent revenue stream.</p>\n<p>He was a primary organizer for Isla Vista self-governance and directed the Yes on E &amp; F campaign for board elections in the CSD.</p>\n<p>The CSD will pay Abboud $4,000 from its professional development fund and may pay more based on his success in acquiring grants, according to a press release.</p>\n<p>Board member Spencer Brandt said the CSD plans to hire a full-time general manager when the district receives additional funding.</p>\n<p>In February 2016, the Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative estimated the general manager salary would be $162,500. In March, before a tax to fund the CSD failed, First District Supervisor Das Williams estimated the salary for a General Manager position would cost $100,000 annually.</p>\n<p>“The I.V. CSD has acquired a general manager at 6 percent of cost estimated in the 2015 Isla Vista Governance Options Financial Analysis Study,” Brandt said. “We are proving that we can do a lot with a little.”</p>\n<p>At a press conference Wednesday afternoon at People’s Park, Bertrand said the general manager’s role will be to execute the board’s policies, but ultimately it is the board’s duty to create policies, develop procedures and oversee finances.</p>\n<p>Bertrand added that the CSD is drafting a contract for the general manager’s role. The CSD’s lawyer, G. Ross Trindle, said the contract will become public when the details have been negotiated and finalized.</p>\n<p>The CSD hired Abboud through his consulting company which he created Sept. 17, two weeks after the application deadline for the position, according to California state records. He is the only employee of the firm and said he created the company so he could accept the position as general manager.</p>\n<p>According to Trindle, the district’s revenue stream would be unable to support salaries and benefits for a public employee. And, because it can’t sustain a payroll system, the CSD hired its general manager through a firm.</p>\n<p>“Having an Interim General Manager on a contract basis via a consultant allows the District to receive the general manager services it needs to function more efficiently to deliver much-needed services to District residents,” Trindle said in an email.</p>\n<p>In a Tuesday press release, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand praised Abboud’s service to I.V. and called it “an honor” to have him as general manager.</p>\n<p>Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday that there were only two applicants to the position, Abboud Consulting, LLC and Lechowicz &amp; Tseng Municipal Consultants, LLC – an Oakland consulting firm formed in March, according to state records.</p>\n<p>Lechowicz &amp; Tseng requested “significantly more” pay than what Abboud requested, Bertrand said, though that fact did not impact the decision since, ultimately, the group removed themselves from the applicant pool.</p>\n<p>The government consulting firm removed itself from the pool after the beginning of the application review process. Bertrand said the group was more focused on finances and strategic planning than the “general management” of the district.</p>\n<p>Abboud said his firm has no clients but has previously worked in acquiring grants and helped the CSD apply for a $20,000 grant with the James S. Bower Foundation.</p>\n<p>Abboud is currently on the board of directors for the Isla Vista Community Development Corporation, an I.V. nonprofit that coordinates funding for the CSD.</p>\n<p>When asked whether this influenced the decision to hire Abboud, Bertrand said he is not legally allowed to speak on the deliberations for a general manager.</p>\n<p>Bertrand also said the CSD plans to release over 100 pages of documents from the application and review process.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the main focus he has for the CSD is to envision its future and lay down a plan for what is to come.</p>\n<p>At Wednesday’s conference, he said his plan was never to stay in I.V. after completing his undergraduate degree, but instead to “do something more traditional.” However, the creation of the CSD drove him to remain in I.V. in order to make it a better place.</p>\n<p>“That’s been the most proud work of my life that I’ve worked on, and it’s such a joy to now be able to have worked on creating this district and now to be able to work on executing the district’s vision,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p><em>Updated Oct. 12, 12:30 a.m.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

id=\"caption-attachment-78989\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">While the SB fire department typically gets 15 to 20 fire alarms per month, they were alerted to 12 fire alarms in a 10-day period at the beginning of Fall Quarter. / Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Twelve fire alarms went off between Sept. 24 and Oct. 3, according to Mike Eliason, SB Fire spokesperson. On average, the fire department typically responds to 10 to 15 fire alarms per month.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said the fire department responded to 51 calls on campus and in Isla Vista in the same time period, 39 of which were emergencies and 12 of which were alarms.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said the increase in alarms could be attributed to the increase in people using campus facilities, although there is no “long-term discernible pattern” as to why alarms go off as often as they do. According to Eliason, most calls happen on Friday and Saturday night in I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said fire alarms are often triggered in various ways. One fire crew member claimed a spider had even triggered one alarm.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There have been times where literally a spider crawls up inside and sets off a sensor,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fire department responded to two calls provoked by the smell of dust from a construction site on campus Tuesday. During the school year, alarms are often set off by burnt popcorn or rice in communal kitchens.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There are more people using hot plates [and] making microwave popcorn than in the summer,” Eliason said in an email. “Take for instance yesterday’s call with the dust. In the summer, someone might not have been there (as it turned out) to pull the alarm.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The only damage in these situations is “slight embarrassment” for the person who pulled the alarm, Eliason said, but it is best to be cautious.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We do not mind responding to these calls, that is why we are here, to serve the public. We send a lot of resources to calls, because we can always turn them back if they aren’t needed,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said pulling false fire alarms “very rarely occurs” at UCSB. Pulling a false fire alarm in California is a felony and can include a punishment of imprisonment, a fine of no less than $500, no more than $10,000 or both, according to state law.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Annual Fire Prevention Week is Oct. 8 to 14 and the county fire department’s focus this year is preparation, according to Eliason.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Every second counts in a fire, he said, and can “mean the difference between residents of our community escaping safely from a fire or having their lives end in tragedy.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To prevent fires, the county fire department recommends drawing a map of one’s home and marking two exits for each room, as well as a path outside.</p>\n<p>In the event of a fire, the fire department also recommends closing doors while evacuating a building since it can possibly slow down the spread of smoke, heat and fire. Numbers on your home’s apartment should be clearly marked so firefighters may easily locate a fire when it occurs.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79001\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79001\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/","id":2364,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2363,2362,2361],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Calif.

Community Services District (CSD) legal counsel Ross G. Trindle told the board on Sept. 12 that the California Supreme Court’s ruling in the<i> California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland</i> case could be interpreted to allow citizens to bring a tax to the board.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tim Bittle, director of legal affairs for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and representative for representing Upland in the case, said his<b> </b>group filed a petition in Sept. to make sure the court’s decision did not “open the door to abuse” from local governments, considering how “confusing” the court’s opinion is.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As of Tuesday night, the California Supreme Court has not clarified its decision. The deadline to respond to Bittle’s group is Nov. 26.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If the court agrees with Trindle’s assessment, local governments would<b><i> </i></b>be able to bypass the two-thirds requirement for special taxes.<i> </i>For this to happen, citizens must create an ordinance, gather 10 percent of voters’ signatures and bring the proposal to the county for approval.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If the county approves it, governments would either vote on the tax at a board meeting or an election with a smaller majority than normally required.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Legal experts are skeptical whether the court’s current ruling allows governments to leave some voters out of the decision-making process.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The majority of I.V. Community Services District (CSD) board members have rejected the possible use of this legal quirk to pass a tax.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">George Thurlow, a board member, told the <i>Nexus</i> that he cannot take a position on the tax because of his position as both a UCSB employee and an elected official. He added that he has recused himself at every opportunity to discuss the tax.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Directors Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Bob Geis, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan have all said they disapprove of passing the tax through a vote of the board. Brandt called it “a very clear no.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Director Geis said he is in favor of a user utility tax, but it is not an issue for seven people to determine. He said that “if it’s not the will of the voters,” they would be very displeased with such a decision.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would say that we would want to, in any circumstances, bring it to the voters,” Geis said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In a third-party assessment of the case, the League of California Cities said local tax measures proposed by citizens should be open to the same requirements as those proposed by a local government. The group provided their review of the case to the courts in October of last year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The group recommended that cities in similar situations should “consult with their city attorney” due to the “lack of clarity” in the court’s decision.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Legal experts in the county are currently keeping an eye on the issue but have yet to analyze it in detail due to its tentative nature.</p>\n<p>Mike Ghizzoni, legal counsel for the county of Santa Barbara, said he has read the case and is monitoring it but will not provide analysis until the petition has been granted or denied and the case is finalized.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79004\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79004\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/","id":4387,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4386,4385,4384],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Detective Joins IVFP Following  Student Protests, Demands","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gutierrez was assigned to IVFP because of his work as a detective in the Criminal Investigations Division for one year, according to Hoover.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A full-time detective with specialized training in sexual assault investigations joined the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on Tuesday, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>Detective Julio Gutierrez is bilingual and has worked with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) for two of his 12 years in the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), according to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover.

Ross Trindle, general counsel for the CSD, said at the board’s Sept. 12 meeting that the court’s decision in the California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland case could create a pathway to a new tax for Isla Vistans if the board decides to act as the ruling seems to suggest.</p>\n<p>The court decision suggests that the board will have the option to bring the tax to a special election or vote on it directly at a board meeting if 10 percent of voters bring signatures supporting an ordinance proposing a tax to the county.</p>\n<p>If the board chooses to pass the tax directly at a board meeting, voters will be stripped of their power to vote. In November 2016, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">locals shot down the tax</a> when Measure F received less than a two-thirds majority of the vote.</p>\n<p>A special election is a vote that could be called immediately, requiring a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>The ordinance voters would create is subject to the county’s approval and must outline the exact ways in which the tax would be collected and how the funds would be spent.</p>\n<p>Trindle said his interpretation of the court ruling was widely debated by legal scholars and that it is currently unclear whether the board would be able to take this option. He suggested the board focus on the issue in the “user utility tax ballot measure ad-hoc committee” created to work on putting the tax on the ballot.</p>\n<p>“I throw this out there because there is a very large question that is unresolved,” Trindle said. “There are legal scholars, colleagues on one side, that say the issue is very narrow… and there are media accounts and experts on the other side that say, ‘No that’s absolutely thrown into question.’”</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> contacted the offices of Supervisor Joan Hartmann, the District Attorney and the County of Santa Barbara’s legal counsel for comment on the legality of Trindle’s interpretation of the court ruling.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, none have responded to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Trindle said the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, an organization that helped amend the state constitution to require a two-thirds majority to pass a tax, was “very disappointed” with the court’s ruling because it could be interpreted as a way to circumvent the supermajority necessary to pass a tax.</p>\n<p>“They’ve specifically come out and commented that this would allow for ‘collusion’ between governments and special interest groups to effectively back-door taxes through this lower-level of scrutiny process,” Trindle said.</p>\n<p>In an interview last month, board chair Ethan Bertrand told the<em> Nexus</em> there were plans to put the tax on the ballot in June or November of 2018 and said he was confident it would pass.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78801\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78801\" data-attachment-id=\"78801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/new-tax-for-csd-could-bypass-voters/csd-new-tax-by-william-tracy-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CSD NEW TAX BY WILLIAM TRACY-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78801\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>William Tracy / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Trindle’s comments at the end of the Sept. 12 meeting, however, present the board an opportunity to essentially bypass voters and create the tax through a simple majority at a board meeting.</p>\n<p>Voters last attempted to pass a tax in I.V. in November 2016, when it created the CSD through Measure E. Measures E and F were broadly campaigned to be voted on jointly, with E establishing the district and F funding it through a tax on the use of utilities in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Pressure slowly mounts on the CSD as it could be terminated if it fails to pass a tax. The bill that created the I.V. CSD, Assembly Bill 3, says “the district would be dissolved” if a utility user tax is not passed by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>I.V. lawmakers will be weighing the decision to create the tax independent of most voters’ input or to bring the issue to the public. Some board members have spoken out against the move.</p>\n<p>Speaking on the subject, which was not on the meeting’s agenda, Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said at the meeting that voting directly on a tax through the board would give the public a perception that was “sketchy.”</p>\n<p>“If we’re as concerned as we are with transparency and due process, this is a novel approach,” Hedges said before being reminded by Director Jay Freeman that he was not legally allowed to speak on the subject.</p>\n<p>The Ralph M. Brown Act limits board conversations to the subjects on the agenda posted to the public.</p>\n<p>In a text message to a reporter, Freeman said he opposed bringing the tax to a vote of the board and called the possibility of using this new court ruling a “legal hack.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that if we are to raise a tax we should use the process people expect,” Freeman said. “Tax measures should go to the voters.”</p>\n<p>The I.V.

The I.V. community has witnessed several movements in favor of cityhood, but the state ultimately determined these efforts to be politically and financially infeasible.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury determined that a CSD would be the best option to represent the unincorporated community.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 (AB-3) was introduced to the state assembly in 2014 and would effectively create a new government in I.V. capable of addressing the needs of the “transient student population” and its “predominantly renter-oriented” community.</p>\n<p>The bill also assigns the CSD powers to provide services related to infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security and roads. Governor Jerry Brown signed AB-3 into law on Oct. 7, 2015, paving the way for Measure E to be on the ballot in Nov. 2016.</p>\n<p>Measure E was the ballot measure to formally create the Isla Vista CSD and was coupled on the ballot with Measure F, a utility user tax meant to fund the district through an 8 percent tax on gas, water, electricity, sewage and garbage disposal for users in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>CSD Financial Strains</strong></p>\n<p>While most of the country focused on welcoming and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-09/over-1000-uc-santa-barbara-students-protest-in-isla-vista-after-trump-elected-president/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protesting</a> a new president on Nov. 9, 2016, I.V. residents also saw the birth of a new government by voting a resounding 87.52 percent “yes” on Measure E.</p>\n<p>The measure created the Isla Vista CSD with voters electing Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan as directors to lead the newly formed government.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman described the district as an “experiment” in providing small-scale government that has the “visceral” ability for students to become involved because of its relationship with UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Measure F, however, received 61.22 percent of the total vote in favor, failing to reach the two-third (66 percent) vote necessary to impose the tax. This effectively left the CSD fundless and with little ability to finance the services it wished to provide.</p>\n<p>The failure to pass this tax is worrisome for the future of the district, as AB-3 stipulates that “the district would be dissolved” if a utility user tax is not passed by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>CSD board chair Ethan Bertrand, however, remains confident in its future.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> Tuesday, Bertrand said there are plans to put the tax on the ballot once more in June or November of next year. He also said the district has received approximately $6,500 in funding from private donations, grants and contributions from Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p><strong>Establishing Governance</strong></p>\n<p>The CSD held its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first meeting in March</a> and has been meeting every two weeks since then.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the district tries to make its meetings “as interactive as possible” because it works with all aspects of the community, including students, families and businesses.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of the beauty of a small government that we have the ability to kind of work directly with [the public],” he said.</p>\n<p>I.V. now has two entities directly governing it: the Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD), a small body established in 1972 to regulate parks and other outdoor spaces, and the CSD, a body with broader governing powers.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the administrative framework took a long time to build but said he feels the CSD is now “getting [its] wings” as it begins to provide services.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals of the CSD</strong></p>\n<p>According to Bertrand, public safety is “the top priority,” as the CSD is working with UCSB to acquire this year’s $200,000 in annual funding for the next seven years. The university <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-06/ucsb-pledges-1-4-million-to-isla-vista-self-governance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pledged</a> this funding during the district’s creation for “mutually agreed-upon projects, programs and services.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said he is in interested in “community-oriented policing services” rather than placing sworn officers on the streets. He said he believes this will solidify the relationship between residents and law enforcement and will contribute to a decline in the amount of sexual assault in I.V., which has<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/sexual-assault-reports-up-in-i-v/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> increased in recent years</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to that sum, the district is applying for a $20,000 grant with the James S. Bower Foundation, a local philanthropy, and acquired $3,000 from the Fund for Santa Barbara for “community programming.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, the district plans to use the funds to schedule community meetings at the Community Conference Room in I.V., currently used for CSD meetings, and loan it to organizations interested in gathering there.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the room can only be used for noncommercial purposes but said the district will not focus on the content of the meetings that happen there. Managing the room’s scheduling would be the first service the CSD provides since its creation.</p>\n<p>The CSD created an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/new-csd-interns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internship program</a> in conjunction with UCSB’s political science department in Spring Quarter, employing five interns to-date, but has not yet provided large-scale services to I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>The district’s ability to provide services has been bogged down significantly by its lack of funding, as well as its lack of structure, as it has spent several months drafting policies and developing procedures to follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Hopes</strong></p>\n<p>As the CSD continues to develop and find new funding sources for the services it intends to provide, its directors express optimism toward the newborn government’s future.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the CSD was created to make I.V. a safer place and to give the community the “long-deserved voice” within local government.</p>\n<p>“This is a huge step for participatory government in I.V.,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD meets every second and fourth Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Conference Room on 970 Embarcadero Del Mar behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>“If you have any interest at all in how society operates, in how all of those services that you rely on everyday [are provided] … even if we’re not the ones providing to you, we are a model by which you can learn how government functions,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, August 24, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78732\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78732\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/","id":4388,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4387,4386,4385],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hit and Run Leaves UCSB Student with Broken Leg","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2017-06-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170628_125823_04_00.jpg?resize=352%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170628_125823_04_00.jpg?resize=352%2C240&ssl=1","description":"California Highway Patrol (CHP) responded Wednesday afternoon to a call of a hit and run with major injuries on Pardall and Embarcadero Del Mar.

UCSB’s non-traditional graduating seniors have lived through the most testing experiences, trotting quietly but triumphantly to the commencement stage this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB defines a non-traditional student as someone who is either married, a parent, an undergraduate over 24 or a graduate student over 29.</p>\n<p>For most people, having a child at 17 can mean an obstacle course too difficult to overcome.</p>\n<p>As only 40 percent of teen mothers finish high school and fewer than 2 percent finish college by age 30, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the odds seem insurmountable for young parents.

Yang on commencement weekend next week.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78387\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78387\" data-attachment-id=\"78387\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/despite-facing-unlikely-odds-non-traditional-grads-persevere/image1-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?fit=750%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,729\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?fit=250%2C243&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?fit=750%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78387\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?resize=750%2C729\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"729\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?resize=250%2C243&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78387\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Graduating senior Hannah Cloe (right) is pictured here at the Goleta Pier with fiancé Alex Zhukov and her three-year-old son, Hayden. <em>Courtesy of Hannah Cloe</em></p></div>\n<p>Cloe, a fourth-year English major, transferred to UCSB after completing her associate’s degree in neuroscience at Saddleback College. Despite beginning higher education in a S.T.E.M. field, Cloe said she realized it was not what she wanted to work in for a living.</p>\n<p>She has since been focusing on novel writing and plans to complete a manuscript after completing her senior thesis with English professor Chris Newfield. Her most recent work is about a hiker traveling the Appalachian Mountains.</p>\n<p>Cloe said she has a passion for “writing about the human experience” and dreams of completing an MFA in creative writing at Columbia University.</p>\n<p>Despite Cloe’s academic achievements, she once felt her life was over when she became pregnant at the age of 17. She said people she knew had told her that her life was over and it “certainly felt that way.”</p>\n<p>She said being a young mother has been difficult because of the stigma that people have over young parents.</p>\n<p>“I’ve once had a man say to me, ‘You shouldn’t be out here; you’re a bad example for my daughter,’” she said.</p>\n<p>But Cloe was not deterred.</p>\n<p>She enrolled as an English major at UCSB in 2016, taking over 21 units a quarter to complete her B.A. in one year. She wakes up at 6:30 a.m. every morning to prepare her three-year-old son, Hayden, for daycare and attending school full time.</p>\n<p>“And these people know nothing about my life; I’ve worked hard to go against what the odds were against me, and I’m proud to say I’ve almost done that,” she said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will say goodbye to many more students like Cloe who have overcome great odds and gone on to achieve incredible things.</p>\n<p>Kou Collins, 24, will also be walking this year to receive his bachelor’s degree in communication.</p>\n<p>He transferred from Santa Monica College and the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he admits having suffered depression. He said school in Boulder was difficult for him, and he struggled to deal with the new environments and people.</p>\n<p>Collins served as on-campus senator for the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate last year and has been involved with campus organizations since he transferred to UCSB in 2015. He has worked with Blunite and the Residence Hall Association since his first year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78385\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78385\" data-attachment-id=\"78385\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/despite-facing-unlikely-odds-non-traditional-grads-persevere/kou-collins/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kou-Collins.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kou Collins\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kou-Collins.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kou-Collins.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78385\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kou-Collins.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kou-Collins.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kou-Collins.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kou-Collins.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kou-Collins.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kou-Collins.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78385\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kou Collins, center, is a graduating senior and former <em>o</em>n-campus senator.

id=\"caption-attachment-78246\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Over 40 people were in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting, with several people voicing their concerns about the way law enforcement deals with cases.</p>\n<p>The town hall began with a description of the CSD and its powers. Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the bill that established the I.V. CSD, allows the district to provide eight specific services, including the ability to “contract” with the county and the UC Regents for “additional police protection services.”</p>\n<p>The CSD’s board is looking to exercise that power to improve public safety, as the amount of reported sexual assaults reached 48 this previous year.</p>\n<p>Members of the public took issue with the way law enforcement distributes information about crimes. During public comment, many said they were worried some crimes were not being reported in UC Police Department (UCPD) timely warnings or in the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) press releases.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board member Daniel Torres began the public comment with concerns about the way law enforcement chooses to distribute information.</p>\n<p>Torres alluded to a crime reported by SBSO in April, when two male subjects allegedly assaulted a 28-year-old man after making comments about his sexual orientation. The event occurred on Sunday of UC Santa Barbara’s pride week, and while SBSO investigated the incident as a hate crime, it did not release a statement immediately.</p>\n<p>Torres said he wished to see more transparency from local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“When you are a part of these communities and people in your community are physically getting assaulted because of their identity, that’s something people need to know about ASAP,” Torres said.</p>\n<p>I.V. resident Andrew Pragin expressed his own concern over why he did not receive a timely warning email from UCPD about a stabbing this weekend, which UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson addressed by saying the department does not send timely warnings for every incident in I.V.</p>\n<p>Olson said not all incidents are handled by UCPD because its main jurisdiction is the UC Santa Barbara campus and it is not responsible for patrolling all of the I.V. area. UCPD has a crime log on its website of all the incidents the department responds to, he said.</p>\n<p>“I think some of the misunderstanding is that the UCPD or the campus has this overarching obligation to send out timely warning to the I.V. community, and that’s not always the case,” Olson said.</p>\n<p>In reference to the stabbing, Olson said since there were arrests made and there was no more “ongoing risk” to the public, an additional alert is not recommended.</p>\n<p>“They would frown on us just sending out the alerts under those circumstances,” Olson said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78261\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78261\" data-attachment-id=\"78261\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/img_0835/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0835\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78261\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>While Olson said additional alerts in these cases are excessive, members of the public express a desire to know more about the process that their cases go through after they are reported to the police.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Batsheva Stoll echoed other speakers’ words on law enforcement transparency.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she and her friends suspected they were being stalked one night in I.V. and reported the incident to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), but she said they did not receive follow-up information about what the authorities were doing to investigate the incident.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she would have liked to know what steps IVFP was taking to investigate the incident and said she believes the public would benefit from understanding the steps law enforcement takes when responding to the public’s concerns.</p>\n<p>“It would be helpful if there was some sort of response system where the person was aware of how it was being dealt with for peace of mind,” Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Among the proposed solutions to the public’s interest in the investigative process was the formation of a civilian review board to internally analyze the work local law enforcement is doing.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann brought into question the way crime is being analyzed, questioning how the law enforcement groups that patrol I.V. are using their data.</p>\n<p>Olson said UCPD creates internal reports and discusses strategies to address crime trends at monthly meetings.</p>\n<p>“In the past we’ve done some bait bike enforcement … We have GPS tracking devices. We certainly see that bike theft is a big issue on campus,” Olson said. “So we do have a number of issues that pop up and we track the data and we look at times and we do deploy officers accordingly.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said while law enforcement agencies are collecting data, the way they currently analyze it leaves room for improvement.

A court date has been set for Sept. 15 of this year. <em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The parents of UC Santa Barbara students James Hong and David Wang — the shooter’s roommates — and their friend, George Chen, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in March 2015 against the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and Capri Apartments, arguing that their deaths could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>While the Sheriff’s Department has been dropped from the lawsuit, Hi Desert Mobile Home Park L.P., the company that owns Capri Apartments, and Asset Campus Housing (ACH), a third-party student housing property management company, are still on the lawsuit and will face trial on Sept. 15.</p>\n<p>The defendants submitted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, but it was rejected this year on Feb. 10.</p>\n<p>Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, the two L.A.-based law firms representing the victims’ parents, claimed negligence and wrongful death against the two companies, which they believe should have properly vetted Elliot Rodger before assigning him to be Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>According to court documents obtained by the Nexus, the parents’ original complaint against the two companies alleged Capri Apartments was warned Rodger was a “violent and dangerous threat to his roommates.”</p>\n<p>Allegedly, the apartment company “had actual and constructive knowledge of his bizarre behavior,” yet still did not conduct a “reasonable investigation” before assigning him as Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>“Plaintiffs are informed and believe that [the two companies], through their on-site management personnel, were aware that law enforcement officers had come to Apt. #7 due to a dispute between Rodger and his roommates,” according to the original 2015 complaint.</p>\n<p>The complaint says as a result of the two companies’ “negligence,” Hong, Wang and Chen were “rendered completely vulnerable” to Rodger and “subjected to his violent acts, which caused their deaths.”</p>\n<p>The families are suing for any psychological, emotional or physical pain caused by the deaths of the three victims and are seeking compensation as “the Court deems just and proper.”</p>\n<p>“[The parents of Chen, Hong and Wang] have incurred funeral and burial expenses and suffered extreme and severe distress, pain, anguish and other economic and non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Hong and Wang were assigned to Apt. #7 at Capri Apartments of Seville Road in September 2013 despite several complaints from Rodger’s old roommates about his mental well-being.</p>\n<p>In late 2011, Rodger was assigned two Hispanic male roommates who he said were “rowdy, inferior, pig-faced thugs,” according to his manifesto. Within days of meeting them, he insulted them and told them he was “superior,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>In September of 2011, Rodger was assigned a new roommate who, a few months later, “began to fear for his personal safety,” according to the complaint the parents’ lawyers filed.</p>\n<p>According to the roommate’s complaint to the apartment complex, “Living with Eliot [sic] is like living with a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, and the only way to solve this problem is by removing it. We are at the point where I fear for my safety.”</p>\n<p>The parents’ lawyers claim in a Feb. 10, 2017, court document that the three victims “simply would not have been killed” if the companies had complied with “basic industry standards and at a reasonable level of care.”</p>\n<p>A representative from Capri Apartments said they were uncomfortable commenting on the case but could say “the management company has changed since 2014.”</p>\n<p>Patrick McNicholas, partner of McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, said “the apartment was completely lacking in training its onsite managers in issues of safety, on issues of matching roommates, in issues making sure that the roommates were safe.”</p>\n<p>“The parents are very hopeful their children will not have died in vain,” he said.</p>\n<p>McNicholas also said the parents hope companies with similar business models will take student safety seriously and implement proper policies and procedures to prevent similar events.</p>\n<p>“They’re moving forward with their lives, but they are beyond devastated,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, May 25, 2017, edition of

fiscal year with a $1.4 million deficit, 49 vacant positions and over $6 million spent in overtime expenses.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County officials met this Tuesday to discuss a quarterly report of the county budget. Of the 68 departments, 65 are positive or at budget.</p>\n<p>The county executive office (CEO) and auditor-controller presented a report of the third quarter of the fiscal year at Tuesday’s board of supervisors meeting, revealing that the Sheriff’s Office is projected to reach a deficit of $1.4 million by the end of the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Despite what might seem to be a daunting figure, the county is projected to end the fiscal year with a net increase of $750,000 in their general fund.</p>\n<p>SBSO’s deficit is an example of some of the fiscal challenges the county is facing this year. The county is expected to reach an approximate $35 million deficit if it continues to operate at this level of expenditure and has been re-balancing its budget for the next fiscal year to prevent funding issues.</p>\n<p>Following budget workshops with the county Board of Supervisors in April, the CEO is expected to release its proposed budget for the next fiscal year next Thursday. The Board of Supervisors will then hold its budget hearings on June 12, during which the public is welcome to comment on the final budget. If necessary, the hearings will continue on June 14 and 16.</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate any potential budget issues, county officials have proposed 5 percent budget cuts across all departments.</p>\n<p>SBSO is facing a possible reduction of nine full-time positions in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), though Undersheriff Bernard Melekian has spoken to the board in favor of keeping the positions during last month’s budget workshop meetings.</p>\n<p>According to documents outlining the proposed cuts’ fiscal impact, reductions to the IVFP alone would bring approximately $1.9 million to the county’s general fund. These reductions would include removing three sergeants, two special duty deputies and four deputies, as well as reducing overtime pay.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover, Isla Vista is the only station in the county that is not operating “at minimum staffing,” meaning there will likely be cuts in this area to balance the department’s finances.</p>\n<p>“As a result, we proposed a significant reduction in our staffing levels at the IVFP. We are in discussions with the CEO’s Office and University representatives, and at this point nothing has been decided as of yet,” Hoover said in an email.</p>\n<p>IVFP is not the only section of SBSO that would see cuts. The proposed cuts for SBSO in the next fiscal year total approximately $7.6 million.</p>\n<p>While these cuts were proposed at the budget workshops in April, none of the reductions have been finalized. They will go through public hearings before they are adopted.</p>\n<p>Each county department’s presentation during last month’s budget workshops included a section for departments to request a restoration or expansion of programs slated to be cut.</p>\n<p>In Melekian’s presentation, he said IVFP is a “critical” part of SBSO’s budget priorities but acknowledged that the department is facing issues when it comes to staffing, updating technology and funding.</p>\n<p>Melekian said the department’s equipment is outdated. The department is working on updating their computerized dispatch system as well as their jail management system — which will be operational in November — but he said the records management system remains out of date.</p>\n<p>According to Melekian, SBSO also needs new portable radios and car systems. The department does not proactively replace equipment but rather rushes to gather funding when old equipment fails to function.</p>\n<p>In addition to outdated technology, SBSO currently has 49 total vacancies in its stations, causing employees to work overtime. As a result, SBSO has had massive overtime expenses totaling $6.4 million for this fiscal year, offset partially by $5.4 million in salaries and benefits savings, according to a board letter from Tuesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>According to the letter from the board of supervisors, “Further exacerbating the vacancy issue, an additional 17 patrol deputies and 12 custody deputies were on worker’s compensation leave, who not only continue to draw salary, but also create vacancies that are often covered with overtime.”</p>\n<p>The board anticipates that if the department ends the year with negative net financial impact, it will need to use the general fund to balance its deficit.</p>\n<p>“This assumption has already been factored into the projected year-end net positive variance of $750 thousand in the general fund,” according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The county will make their final decisions regarding the budget in June.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77957\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77957\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/amid-budget-woes-sb-sheriffs-office-faces-potential-staff-cuts/","id":4406,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4405,4404,4403],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVRPD Accepts $13,000 Donation from UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Special-Tax-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Special-Tax-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District accepted $13,000 from UC Santa Barbara this Thursday as part of an agreement to use the funds for park improvements and maintenance.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) accepted $13,000 from UC Santa Barbara this Thursday as part of an agreement to use the funds for park improvements and maintenance.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD voted 4-0, with Director Charles Lopez absent, in favor of a resolution to accept the funds on Thursday.
