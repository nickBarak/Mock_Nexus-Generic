Tuition and fees for fall will also remain unchanged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang also said that any student who wishes to continue learning entirely remotely will be given the option to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the email stated that the school would be updating procedures as new safety protocols are released and is “thinking creatively” about face-to-face interaction, currently “all courses with an enrollment of more than 50 students will require remote instruction,” Yang stated in the email.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, classes with less than 50 students have no guarantee of in-person instruction, which will be limited to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small classes, seminars and some arts and performance courses and labs. Decisions about final course formats will be announced in July, Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that the plans for fall quarter instruction are not final, and that the university is working to “develop more face-to-face course offerings.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is also currently planning for all undergraduate residence halls to be limited to double occupancy — with the possibility of limiting rooms to single occupants — reducing the number of housing spaces available to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All students who will be living in campus residences during the 2020-21 school year will be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test and the school will be implementing additional safety policies, including limiting social interactions for the first two weeks, enforcing a no-visitor policy and asking students not to travel away from campus during the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student housing will not be impacted by the new social distancing practices and most graduate seminars will be conducted remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the hybrid class arrangement, tuition and student fees will not be reduced “r</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">egardless of the method of instruction,” following policies set by the University of California Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President, Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university plans to provide both remote and in-person campus life activities as well as co-curricular programming. These activities will be contingent on new safety practices,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including requiring masks to be worn at all times, performing daily health checks before entering campus, and following social distancing guidelines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email also detailed plans to “bring student-athletes back to campus in preparation for fall competition and the academic year … in alignment with the NCAA’s resocialization action plan for college sports.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang informed students of coronavirus-related research being piloted by UCSB faculty, including “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research surveillance testing study</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> using a CRISPR-based detection system that is designed to detect COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals,” currently in the development stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The campus is also putting in place a structure that will enable the testing of campus community members who show symptoms of COVID-19 with traditional qPCR testing,” the email continued, also stating that UCSB will be “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working closely with local public health officials, and will be supporting Public Health’s efforts to conduct contact tracing of campus community members who test positive for COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is also planning to ramp up in-person research projects and “ultimately to get all on-campus research projects underway again at effective levels, while still reducing the number of people working on campus during the pandemic,” Yang wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff not involved in approved on-campus research and currently working from home will continue to work remotely from home during the summer. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

The new resolution will require the Internal Vice President to read a land recognition before every senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Esme Quintero-Cubillan, who was the first author on both resolutions, said her conversations with Mia Lopez, UCSB’s American Indian Student Association (AISA) tribal liaison, inspired her to write a resolution that was a “call to action” as well as a recognition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the public forum, students expressed the importance of representation for Indigenous students, who make up only 1% of the school’s population. Jeike Meijer, UCSB’s 2018-2019 External Vice President for Local Affairs and an Indigenous student, called on senators to do more for Indigenous communities in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A couple of minutes at the beginning of a senate meeting is so small, if you think about it, and as student leaders your platforms said that you aim to represent minorities and more minority groups. And this seems literally like the most tiny way that you can do that,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate passed a second resolution on Friday condemning the United States’ “inadequate response” to the conditions of the Navajo Nation amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Navajo Nation is currently experiencing an </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-06-03/la-na-navajo-nation-coronavirus-police\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infection rate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is higher than New York City. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quintero-Cubillan said the resolution also focuses on how the government “left [behind] the Navajo Nation” and “how they failed to provide for them” amidst a pandemic. The resolution details how the Navajo Nation has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and ensures the A.S. Senate will “continue to support the Navajo Nation through advocacy, awareness, and however stipulated by indigenous advocates.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were promised $8 million in aid, yet were only supplied body bags. And I really tried to hit home the idea that America genuinely does not care about Indigenous lives or Indigenous voices,” Quintero-Cubillan continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Quintero-Cubillan and Meijer emphasized the importance of holding the University of California (UC) accountable for harming indigenous communities, including the UC’s role in </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-05/thirty-meter-telescope-has-received-68m-from-uc-in-past-six-years/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funding the Thirty Meter Telescope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Hawaii which is planned to be built on sacred mountain of Mauna Kea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“America is occupied land.

The group, created in the fall of 2015, offers a variety of different gaming platforms for UCSB students from the amateur to competitive level. Gaucho Gaming has 942 members on its Discord server, which the group uses to promote and organize events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At school, we also have in-person events, so that definitely brings people together and we just all have a common interest,” Annie Huang, a second-year statistics and linguistics double major and the co-president of Gaucho Gaming, said. “So now, we have only online communication and activities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While clubs have faced difficulties staying together as a result of having their members strewn across the country and isolated at home, Gaucho Gaming is uniquely positioned to make the leap from in-person social events to online-only communication. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since gaming is, obviously, an online thing, it’s been a way to keep in touch with friends, and keeps me connected ” Huang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a joke, that we’re helping save the world by staying inside and gaming,” Huang added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, the club hosts “re</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gular meetings, fun socials, competitive events, and a huge LAN event every quarter,” a local area network that interconnects computers within physical spaces like room or arena, according to its website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Discord server allows members to make friends and find gaming buddies, as well as “more serious stuff” like opportunities for jobs within the gaming field, Huang said, which has also continued during spring quarter. This Saturday, Gaucho Gaming and UCSB Esports will host a panel in the Discord called “Career in Esports,” with industry professionals from Team Liquid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the club has worked to expand its professional network with the help of Francisco Rodriguez, a fourth-year global studies and economics major and the club’s esports outreach officer, who organizes panels and helps gamers understand career paths within the gaming industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the group had a “rocky start” with participation at the start of the online quarter, according to Huang, the cancellation of in-person socializing events forced them to get creative. And with computer-savvy students at the helm, Huang said she has been pleased with recent event participation, despite the challenges they’ve faced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 16, Gaucho Gaming hosted its first-ever Game-A-Thon, sponsored by the gaming gear company Logitech G, where players participated in popular video games League of Legends and Valorant for prizes including Logitech G computer mice, gift cards and game credits, according to their Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Game-A-Thon, which was meant to serve as a replacement for the group’s popular LAN event, saw about 200 participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho Gaming has also hosted other events this quarter, like weekly game play, giveaways, and watch parties, according to their Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For weekly play, we let our members know what servers we will be on, and what time, and then sort of host spaces for UCSB students to play,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The club is also reaching out to neighboring schools like UC Los Angeles and Cal Poly to host interconnected events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Doing these things online might give us the opportunity to meet up in person,” Huang said. “That’s definitely something to consider.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group also organizes teams for specific video games; tryouts for UCSB’s League of Legends A and B competition teams recently took place. The event invited all UCSB students to try out, including incoming freshmen and transfers, according to the group’s social media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huang emphasized how video games and the collaboration that Gaucho Gaming provides gives students the opportunity to connect and socialize during what can be a lonely isolation. Although video games sometimes get a negative reputation as an isolating activity, she explained, they can also be a force for good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being indoors more often has brought our online community together.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

The state approved the attestation on May 20, allowing an “exciting next step for our entire community,” Van Do-Reynoso, director of the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, said in the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Santa Barbara County is implementing a program to help businesses expand into “public right-of-way outdoor areas” in the county’s unincorporated regions to help advance social distancing protocols, the press release read. A second phase of the project is in development to help businesses expand onto private property, like parking lots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the evening of May 21 in Isla Vista, the Study Hall Bar and Grill was open for business in </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-22/study-hall-bar-open-thursday-night-in-violation-of-county-and-state-health-order/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">direct violation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the state and county stay-at-home orders — and the phase two guidelines — after it was seen serving at least 10 people without masks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Gov.

financial aid at the federal, state and university levels.” </span><em>Courtesy of Regents Livestream</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Special Committee, which was created in 2018 to produce recommendations on basic needs for UC students, heard from UC Basic Needs Committee Co-Chairs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim Galarneau and Ruben Canedo, who presented about the coronavirus pandemic’s economic and social toll on the UC and its students before going on to review recommendations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can now visibly see how income levels, ethnicity, family structure, citizenship status and access to healthcare affect student’s access to education and their mental health,” a UC San Diego student observer said during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And those disparities have definitely been visible when it comes to basic needs resources,” the student observer continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yvette Gullatt, vice provost for Diversity and Engagement and chief outreach officer for the University of California, said the special committee is concerned with both “articulat[ing] our concerns while also moving forward” and has delayed discussion about its recommendations for the UC Regents September meeting, when the committee would be evaluating how pertinent their recommendations have proven to be. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One goal of the new recommendations is to “advocate for greater investment in financial aid at the federal, state and university levels.” Paired with the timing of the coronavirus pandemic, additional financial aid could serve to reduce the financial burden many UC students are currently experiencing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC has currently been allocated $260 million through the federal C.A.R.E.S. act, $130 million of which was allocated to campuses for the distribution of emergency grants for students, according to Director of Student Financial Support Shawn Brick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Student Regent Hayley Wheddle, the head of the Special Committee, spearheaded the basic needs report over her year-long term; Tuesday’s meeting was her last as a student regent. She commended the UC on “proactively looking to fill the gaps” in financial aid, as the committee aims to push federal funding going forward, according to the committee’s draft recommendations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the meeting, presenters and speakers emphasized the need to utilize CalFresh, which can now be used to purchase online groceries, and the possibility of waiving the 20-hour per-week work requirements that are usually necessary to qualify for the food assistance program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their drafted recommendations emphasized the importance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maximizing overall enrollment in CalFresh through “running large-scale onsite CalFresh enrollment clinics,” as well as “training county departments of social services workers to support UC students with CalFresh application and enrollment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the committee hopes to assist students who are not eligible for CalFresh with various on-campus programs and aims to close the 22% gap in food insecurity between first-generation and non-first-generation students, according to the report.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campuses have been made responsible for UC students who are now, due to moving back to their hometowns, closer to a different UC campus than the one that they are enrolled in. According to the committee Co-Chair Tim Galarneau,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> UC students can receive certain services on any given campus such as meal swipes, bagged grocery pickup, temporary housing and emergency grants regardless of which campus they’re enrolled at.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But because of the coronavirus pandemic, Galarneau said, many campuses are inherently under-equipped for “daily uncertainties and major changes to resources, policies, processes, and decision making” as a result of limited staffing and uncertainty surrounding future funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With basic needs providers on college campuses designated as first responders to the coronavirus pandemic, the Special Committee on Basic Needs hopes to address the challenges the UC is facing with help from local campuses and their basic needs providers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our basic needs movement is a nascent one, coinciding with natural disasters and a pandemic, coinciding when food security and a sense of community have been needed the most,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gullatt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is changing as the needs of students change.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

But beyond the Associated Students (A.S.) Legal Code, the role requires “a great deal of listening” and a willingness for personal connection, according to Nguyen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), which is required to wait for students to reach out on their own accord before offering help, suffers from a lack of visibility imbued in the position, an element of his office that he has struggled to promote throughout the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“S.A.G. is very different from the other A.S. offices. It’s a little more removed from A.S. as an entity,” Nguyen said. “It’s really all for the students, and there’s nothing more rewarding than a student walking out of your office, and them knowing it isn’t the end of the world, and knowing what’s about to happen to them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen, an off-campus senator in the 2018-2019 school year and the sole contender for the position of S.A.G. when he ran in 2019, was criticized for his lack of relevant experience for the position. He had “zero experience” within the OSA while <a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/\">running for the position</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen acknowledged his lack of experience for the role, calling it something he “worked really, really hard to overcome.” He said he worked to educate himself on the ins and outs of the office through relationships with mentors from A.S. and the Isla Vista community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also acknowledged his own personal growth and the empathy that was required of him to properly carry out the duties of the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was scared, running for this position. I was so scared I was going to mess it up. But then, as I went through the job, I realized that the most important part of it was being really empathetic, and really present,” Nguyen explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike other A.S. positions, the work of the S.A.G. is inherently less transparent because it deals with confidential case files. While Nguyen couldn’t discuss specific cases, he said he definitely noticed “a trend in plagiarism cases” throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Usually, if students know they’re guilty, they’ll just bite the bullet, take the punishment,” Nguyen said. But for “students who truly thought they hadn’t plagiarized,” Nguyen and his team were able to take the issue to the faculty member and work out a solution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While casework like this is an important part of the job, Nguyen credited Grecia Martinez, his predecessor, as helpful to some of his office’s other successes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grecia was amazing,” he said. “She sat down with me, explained so many of her projects, and a lot of these we worked on during my term.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That included the digitization of case intake forms so future S.A.G.’s can access the database and look up how a particular case was handled in the past for reference, Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also took Martinez’s advice and decided to drop one of his main campaigning platforms, a school-wide poll to see what services students needed as a whole, which was first suggested by Jack Tannenbaum, the 2017-2018 S.A.G. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I talked to Grecia about it, she thought, and I agreed, that the office, since it’s still so new, really needed to focus on outreach first, and not this student-body poll,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the poll didn’t work out for the OSA, Nguyen has hopes that other facets of A.S. will continue to work on a similar project to measure students’ needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That type of poll, to see what the student body needs, could be really helpful to any senators, to any office,” he said, adding that A.S. President Alison Sir’s office is working on a project like this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of the interview, Nguyen said he hadn’t heard from his successor, the 2019-2020 S.A.G.-elect Melissa Perez, but suggested that going forward, she should look towards continuing promoting the visibility of the S.A.G. office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a tool a lot of students need. So it would be cool to see her doing stuff like that, to promote the office,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen agreed that in some ways, his term in office had failed to bring the necessary visibility to the community outside of A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, I worked on bringing visibility within A.S. because the office is so new that even people in A.S. didn’t really know about it. I did that with the hopes that those people would spread it to their circles, and we would expand the office that way,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I recognize that for people in none of those circles, there is still a lack of visibility. So I hope Melissa can really focus on that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Nguyen did credit his time and work in the office for successfully building a “very strong, very tight-knit team.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone received all the training, everyone was at every briefing. Everyone, including myself, felt the weight of the job. We knew that a student’s future could be on the line if we weren’t doing our jobs properly,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen also noted that all of his team members who aren’t graduating plan on staying with the office, provided Perez rehires them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he entered the office, Nguyen said only one person from the previous year remained, so he “hired everyone new,” and “really wanted to hire people who were going to stay and love the job,” he said </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with the efforts of Nguyen’s team, working together during the coronavirus pandemic has been difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really just aren’t seeing the case number[s] that we were at school,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, court proceedings for academic misconduct cases have been changing due to the pandemic, according to Nguyen, who added that “everyone is trying to proceed business as usual, but doing so remotely, with things like altered deadlines.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite the challenges he faced during his term, Nguyen said he is “eternally grateful” for his time as S.A.G. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has changed me in ways I didn’t know were possible,” he said. “It was the most rewarding work I’ve ever done in my life. But it was also the hardest work.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on what he would change about the role, Nguyen looked back to the importance of compassion and empathy that he has learned over the past year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really wish that there would be more of an emphasis on empathy for this role. I know that’s something you couldn’t really put in legal code — it probably isn’t very legal — but just really, for the next person who does this job to know, it demands the most caring individual,” he said. “That’s so important to this job.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said the position of Student Advocate General was created in 2015.

IVYP’s normal services. <em>Courtesy of IVYP</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) usually provides year-round, full-day childcare — for children up to five years of age — and after-school care at Isla Vista Elementary and El Camino Elementary. But the coronavirus pandemic has forced the group to convert its services into an online platform, according to Lori Goodman, the program’s director. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, IVYP has pivoted to online materials, including activities and games that children and their parents can participate in together in lieu of IVYP’s normal services, Goodman said. But she added that bridging the digital divide has been a struggle for many families who use the online programs.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Not only do our families not have the kinds of computers they need and the Wi-Fi strength they need, they don’t have the computer literacy, and the same goes for some of our staff,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While facing challenges from the online-only format, IVYP is continuing to utilize online tools to support its families. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivyp.org/covid-19-resources.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online materials</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as “recreational activities, self-care, mindfulness and academic support” for elementary school-aged children are meant to help families who are struggling to adapt to at-home schooling for kids and remote work for parents, Goodman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the website offers articles in English and Spanish on how to talk to children who are struggling with social distancing and provides information on financial support resources for unemployed or furloughed workers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVYP is also implementing an online one-on-one tutoring program through Zoom for students whose parents might not have the skill sets to help them with homework, according to Goodman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to schooling resources, food insecurity has been “one of the largest issues” among families involved with IVYP, Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To support parents who are struggling to put food on the table, IVYP is delivering bagged, prepackaged food to families in I.V. By the third week of April, the program had delivered food to 200 families, and by the fourth week, over 300 families had been helped, according to Goodman.

Recent plans to host community events and other programs with the I.V. Community Services District (I.V.

We are here working full time on their behalf.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Przekop asked students to reach out to UCSB online student resources, counselors and attending students before the May 1 college decision deadline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The right fit is still the single most important factor in selecting a college, so do your research.  Use social media wisely,” she said. “Talk with current students, follow instagram and twitter feeds but at the same time understand that some posts represent the “extremes” so don’t make decisions based on a single post that you read.  Be a smart consumer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But webinars and online events “don’t really give me the same experience as visiting the campus in person,” Campbell noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even for students that have already toured prospective schools, such as California High School senior Amy Hoefs, the coronavirus still leaves more unanswered questions about which school is the right fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Despite having visited before, it’s different once you get accepted and actually need to consider if you can see yourself living there for the next four years … and seeing if UCSB or any other school feels comfortable to me,” Hoefs said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coronavirus has definitely made it harder to choose a school.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ian O’Connor, a Half Moon Bay High student, said he is leaning toward choosing the school due to its coastal atmosphere. Connor resides in Half Moon Bay, a small coastal town in Northern California, and hopes that the similarity in atmosphere between his hometown and Santa Barbara will make the choice a good fit.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing as UCSB is a pretty, coastal school, I’m probably going to go there because it isn’t going to be too much of a culture shock,” O’Connor said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But others, like Campbell, are resorting to other unusual methods to help them pick what colleges they will attend come fall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I posted two videos [on Tik Tok], one for UCSB and one for UCSD. Whichever one gets more views and likes, in theory, that’s the one I’ll pick. It’s mostly a joke,” Campbell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But honestly, it’s the best method of picking that I’ve come up with so far. I have no idea where I’m going to college.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.
