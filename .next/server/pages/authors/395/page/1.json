Specifically, having </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">affection, fondness or sympathy for someone.” Based on this definition, the concept of this word “attachment” appears to be pretty simple. However, attachment is anything but simple. Attachment holds complexity, and above all, attachment holds power. It is what evokes our jealousy and insecurity. It is what complicates our sought-after “friends with benefits” relationships. It is what makes goodbyes feel like losses rather than opportunities for gain. Though attachment is a natural response to emotions and interpersonal relationships, it can often lead to negative feelings of fear and unease. Maybe it’s possible that attachment is simply unavoidable and embedded in our biology. But what if it is possible to gain control over this complicated and compelling force that is attachment?</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77060\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77060\" data-attachment-id=\"77060\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/attachment-in-an-unattached-love/20170412_133732-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1838&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1838\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"20170412_133732-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?fit=250%2C224&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?fit=888%2C797&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77060\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=888%2C797\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=250%2C224&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=768%2C689&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C919&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170412_133732-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77060\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Daily Nexus / Anna Wade</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though we seem to notice it the most in romantic relationships, attachment is something that dates all the way back to our infancy. Our attachment with our parents, specifically our mothers, is what guides our attachment styles in future relationships. There is no doubt that it acts as a natural, guiding force in our lives, allowing us to form bonds and maintain partnerships. Given the relaxed and casual dating culture we have moved toward in the last decade, many people gravitate toward the idea of a “no strings attached” or “hookup buddy” arrangement. It appears easy and fun, possessing the benefits of a relationship yet withholding the complications. However, as showcased in every romantic comedy since 2010, being friends with benefits just doesn’t always work out as smoothly as you think it will. Reasoning this from a scientific perspective is easy. When we cuddle, kiss or have sex, oxytocin is released into our bodies, building those emotions and attachments with or without our cognitive consent. That part of attachment truly is out of our control, and there’s nothing we can do to stop it no matter how hard we try. Rather, our control lies in our response to these emotions and attachment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mistake many people make when entering an “unattached” relationship comes from the misconception that they will be impervious to feelings. We often think of ourselves as invincible, possessing the ability to dictate how we feel and when we feel it. Whether we believe they are simply due to hormones or maybe something deeper like fate, we should know by now that this is never true. For some reason, society seems to view emotion as weakness, demanding that we learn to expunge or ignore them. Rather than attempting to acknowledge and understand them, we’re taught that it’s easier to just try casting them away. This idea of running from or hiding what we feel is based on nothing more than fear.  Learning to love unattached means rejecting that fear.  Learning to love unattached means recognizing, accepting and actually embracing the very emotions that attach us.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>When we acknowledge and respect our feelings, we are giving ourselves validation and love. We give our minds and hearts a break when we remain honest and true rather than trying to force the reality we wish existed.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, we have to remember that each person in our lives has in fact, their own life. Whether it’s our mother, father, brother, friend or a person we’re wholeheartedly in love with, each of us is on our own individual journey. Remembering this makes it a lot easier to take away the personal aspects of attachment that make us feel jealous, insecure or doubtful. Second, we have to learn to accept the way we feel without the expectation that our wants and desires will be met. This doesn’t mean caring about the other person more than we care for ourselves; if anything it means the exact opposite. When we acknowledge and respect our feelings, we are giving ourselves validation and love. We give our minds and hearts a break when we remain honest and true rather than trying to force the reality we wish existed. Once we reach this level of truth and openness, the attachment that seems to control us can become more of a bond to be thankful for. Rather than feeling resentful or hurt at the fact that things are not as we wish they were, we can begin to see the reasons as to why they are not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loving unattached means we respect ourselves and our emotions as well as those of the ones we find ourselves attached to. It means we recognize and acknowledge where we are in life and where they are in theirs. It means always wanting the best for both ourselves and them, even if that means going down different paths. For some, maintaining unattached love requires maintaining boundaries, some of which may need to be physical. And though sex and affection can make unattached love seem more difficult, I believe always remaining honest and true can only lead to positive outcomes. Though we will never be able to un-attach ourselves from emotions, we can un-attach ourselves from insecurity and jealousy. We can un-attach ourselves from disappointment and regret. Most importantly, we can un-attach ourselves from the fear that detaches us from love.  </span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos wants you to respect your feelings and set yourself free from insecurity.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77059\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/attachment-in-an-unattached-love/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77059\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/attachment-in-an-unattached-love/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/attachment-in-an-unattached-love/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/attachment-in-an-unattached-love/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/attachment-in-an-unattached-love/","id":6292,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6291,6290,6289],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sex, Love and Politics","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2017-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/political-date-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/political-date-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos finds fault with the idea that opposites attract in time when our politics are so polarized.

It was my first time going back since the election, so I was hesitant yet curious to hear how some of them felt about our country’s current state. One night over drinks, one of my good girlfriends and I were venting about our disappointment, shock and repulsion over the election results. After relieving our political frustration, we switched topics to her new boyfriend that she is absolutely smitten over. I was feeling so much joy for her as she endlessly listed his positive qualities and kind gestures when she suddenly mentioned that he was a very active supporter of Trump.</p>\n<p>I sat there, puzzled, as I tried to process this information. After everything we had just discussed, how is it possible that she could be so into someone who views life in such a different light? How could she be so invested in a relationship with someone who could have such different beliefs and values? Of course, I believe that coexistence and amiability is possible amongst those of differing political viewpoints, but love? Sex? Marriage? I mean, let’s be honest: This election was not typical. It was full of extremes, and a lot of extremes that affect women, specifically. For most people, this election wasn’t just a matter of being fiscally conservative or wanting lower taxes. Casting a vote for Donald Trump meant a lot more than that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe that coexistence and amiability is possible amongst those of differing political viewpoints, but love? Sex? Marriage?</p></blockquote>\n<p>We are living in a time of intense opposition and frustration. Ultimately, I truly do believe that all of this will lead to positive change, but right now people have to speak out. They have to be honest about what they feel and believe. Regardless of which end of the spectrum you fall on, the issues that are currently on the table are far too big to be brushed under the rug. Trying to start a relationship with someone who you can’t discuss these intense topics with isn’t going to lead to any sort of steady foundation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>People often say that opposites attract. But really, how accurate is that? Sure, we like people that are different. Sometimes it’s nice and necessary to have others balance us out and open our eyes to differing thoughts and views. But when it comes to our core values, they can’t be too far off. Having such fundamental differences is extremely difficult to get past and will most likely result in someone changing or caving in order to make the relationship work. Having a real relationship with someone means that you plan on growing with them. It means that you plan on becoming better as individuals together. I don’t see how that can be possible between two people who have completely different ideas about what constitutes growth and improvement.</p>\n<p>One of the most prominent topics being debated at the moment is that of a woman’s right to have control over her body and health care. Call me crazy, but it seems pretty absurd to be sleeping with someone who holds the opposite view of you on an issue as heavy as this. In my opinion, regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, the person that you are having sex with must share the same opinion. It doesn’t matter if it’s a casual hookup or a serious, long-term relationship.</p>\n<p>All in all, having sex can lead to consequences, one of them being unwanted pregnancy. Even when you’re careful and responsible, accidents can happen. If it does, it’s pertinent that both parties be at least somewhat on the same page. While I personally believe that the ultimate choice is that of the females, knowing where your partner stands on the issue can save a lot grief and pain.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In my opinion, regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, the person that you are having sex with must share the same opinion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are woman who is pro-life, and could never bring yourself to make the decision to terminate a pregnancy, then the guy that you’re sleeping with should share the same mindset. If you are a woman who believes that she has the option to do what she pleases with her body, then you probably shouldn’t be sleeping with someone who voted against you having that choice. How can you be comfortable sharing your body with someone who doesn’t believe in the rights that you have to it? It’s a dynamic that is far too complicated and serious to risk.</p>\n<p>While it is true that people can change one another and open our minds to new ways of thought and belief, trying to force change upon the person you desire isn’t going to result in happiness for either of you. Having a relationship that thrives, challenges and inspires you requires that your fundamental values and beliefs be in alignment. Being able to connect on not only a physical and emotional level, but also on one of intellect will, without a doubt, result in the strongest and most rewarding of bonds. So don’t let yourself settle. Don’t allow yourself to be with someone who makes you feel inferior. We are facing tumultuous times that will be made much easier with the support and affirmation of those we hold closest.</p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos hopes you and yours are on the same page politically. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75194\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75194\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/","id":6286,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6285,6284,6283],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When the Clock Strikes Twelve","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-12-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-31-at-4.38.27-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-31-at-4.38.27-PM.png?resize=825%2C515&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos hopes you don't forget your own value in pursuit of a New Years kiss.

It is a time when sentiment and emotion fill the air. Whether you’re a Scrooge who thinks the holiday season is just one big marketing scheme or a Christmas fanatic who puts their tree up in October, I think it’s safe to say this time of year causes a lot of us to reminisce and reflect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, being single during a time of so much love and connection can lead to feelings of loneliness or fear. It’s pretty much impossible to escape the constant romance and adoration filling every street corner, movie and song. On top of that, it’s cuddle weather 24/7. Getting through December can be rough for many, but nothing comes close to the stress of facing the dreaded New Year’s Kiss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not sure who came up with idea of a New Year’s Kiss, but it’s never been one of my favorite holiday traditions. Don’t get me wrong; I think the concept of it is great. It’s meant to be nothing more than a positive and light-hearted way to kick off a fresh start. In fact, New Year’s Eve is probably my favorite night of the entire year. I just hate the pressure that comes with wondering if you’ll be getting that kiss at midnight. Unless you’re in a committed relationship and spending the evening with that person, you don’t really know what your night is going to hold.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>Unless you’re in a committed relationship and spending the evening with that person, you don’t really know what your night is going to hold.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For some people, that’s part of the fun; not knowing with whom or how you’re going to jump into the next 365 days. I’ve definitely had years in which I went into the night with that mentality and I came out the next day feeling like my year started off on a pretty good note.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the clock ticks closer to 12, it can be pretty comical to watch others search the room aimlessly for a potential comrade. If you haven’t locked one down by 11:50 p.m., you might be in some trouble. As the bar begins to shout “10, 9, 8, 7…” humans of all kinds come together to share that special and sometimes awkward midnight moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren’t one of the lucky ones who found their Midnight McDreamy, you can settle for kissing one of your friends, or perhaps finding a fellow last-minute loner. Considering the fact that I’ve never been in a relationship on New Year’s Eve, these have always been my go-to tactics, and they seem to have worked out decently. Plus, any time I felt that twinge of disappointment, I would tell myself: There’s always next year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this year, I feel a little differently about getting that kiss at midnight. This year, I don’t really have any desire to enter into 2017 with some meaningless, drunk kiss. As cliché as it sounds, the New Year can truly mean a new chapter. For some of us, it can be the motivation we need to make real and difficult changes in our lives. It can be what inspires us to work toward being the best versions of ourselves. Maybe some years, you’re really meant to celebrate your fresh start with just you, and not a stranger in a bar.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you aren’t one of the lucky ones who found their Midnight McDreamy, you can settle for kissing one of your friends, or perhaps finding a fellow last-minute loner.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While strangers in bars can be fun, they can’t come close to giving you the joy you can give yourself. They also can’t replace the void that’s been left by the person you wish you were kissing at midnight. If you’re one of those people who aren’t just dealing with being single on New Year’s, but also with being heartbroken, it can be a double dose of hurt. It’s pretty much impossible not to wonder who they’ll be kissing when the clock strikes 12, and you know you’ll be wishing it were you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, circumstance and timing just don’t allow for miracles to happen, even during the holidays. While this reality can be frustrating and difficult to face, it doesn’t mean you should settle. If you know in your heart how you feel, and who you feel it for, not one person in that bar is going to fill that void. Not one person in that bar is going live up to your expectations. Not one person in that bar is going to give you the kiss you actually want.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, some years we actually do get that movie-moment kiss and fantasize about what the next 365 days may hold. Other years we end the night by tucking ourselves in bed, reminiscing on the 365 days that just passed. This year, I know that no matter what 2017 may bring, I have myself to face it with. Being secure and confident in yourself is one of the most difficult yet important lessons we are forced to learn as humans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving love and acceptance toward ourselves means we know who we are and what we stand for, regardless of mistakes or faults we may posses. It means you don’t need anyone other than yourself to feel validated and valued.  </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not getting that kiss at midnight doesn’t matter because you started your year off with someone who can never be replaced: you. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74641\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74641\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/","id":6284,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6283,6282,6281],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"First Night or Take a Hike?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/THAHUMP.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/THAHUMP.jpg?resize=487%2C599&ssl=1","description":"Whether it's a one night stand or a fairytale college romance, Allie Lebos wants you to put respect above all. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In today’s world, sleeping with someone on the first night isn’t exactly taboo. While there are still stigmas and judgments surrounding it, casually sleeping with someone right after meeting them is viewed by many as nothing more than harmless fun. For the most part, our generation has chosen to embrace and celebrate our sexuality rather than feel ashamed of it. However, some people still choose to maintain old-fashioned and modest views when it comes to sex.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a both guy- and girlfriends who believe that sex is great but simply aren’t willing to give it up on the first night. For them, sex contains many more strings than not, and comfortability is a huge factor. In reality, sex does require a certain level of security and comfort, and some people just naturally possess more of that than others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, while it may not seem like a big deal for many of us, casual sex can definitely have some not-so-casual consequences. From STIs to unwanted pregnancies, there is definitely an element of risk when it comes to sex. Considering these very real possibilities, it makes a lot of sense as to why some people hesitate before jumping into bed with someone who is practically a stranger. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, the way I feel about sex on the first night can be summed up with: to each their own. Some people are comfortable enough to partake in the thrill every weekend, some are a bit choosier and others refuse to take the bait. In my opinion, as long as you’re responsible and standing by your convictions, there’s no wrong answer.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>I even have a friend who was mid-makeout with some guy in a bathroom at a party, and when she said, “I’m not going to have sex with you in this bathroom,” he literally stopped, said “okay” and walked out the door.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, I think a lot of people, especially girls, feel a certain amount of pressure to conform to the hookup culture that we have here in I.V. Everyone here is surrounded by incredibly attractive and charming people. Everyone here is surrounded by options. Everyone here is surrounded by competition. Because of this, I think a lot of girls feel the need to give into a game that they really don’t want to play. And the truth is, no one should be making decisions about their body or sexuality based off of the fear that they will be tossed aside for someone else.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until recently I hadn’t realized how often this happens. It’s hard for me to believe that anyone could so blatantly disregard someone that they’ve just met, simply because they find out that they won’t be getting into their pants just hours after learning each other’s names. The fact that people even have the audacity to do such a thing is pretty shocking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know girls who have spent whole evening with guys, where they danced, kissed and had a great time, only to be completely dropped the second that they let it be known that sex wasn’t an option. I even have a friend who was mid-makeout with some guy in a bathroom at a party, and when she said, “I’m not going to have sex with you in this bathroom,” he literally stopped, said “okay” and walked out the door. She didn’t even give a complete rejection; she simply specified that she wouldn’t do it IN THE DAMN BATHROOM. At first, I thought it was an ego problem. I assumed that these guys were just arrogant, misguided, spoiled idiots with some sort of disturbing god complex. In reality, I think it’s actually the exact opposite.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a girl tells you that she’s not comfortable having sex the first night you’ve met, and you choose to respond in such a disgusting and disrespectful way, all that shows is how insecure you really are. It doesn’t make you look cool, desired or confident; it makes you look like a coward. Running at the slightest sign of rejection or effort literally shows how little self-esteem you must possess, and it’s somewhat laughable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are hundreds of girls in this town who will gladly sleep with guys on the first night, and if that’s what you’re looking for, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, reacting in such an immature and embarrassingly chauvinistic way is not an appropriate response when you run into someone who happens to have different intentions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has differing views and opinions when it comes to sex. However, one thing that everyone should agree upon is that no matter how you choose to go about it, respect is always involved, no matter what the circumstances. On top of that, I guarantee that making a girl (or guy in some cases) feel comfortable and respected will get you a whole lot farther in the bedroom than spinelessly attempting to manipulate or pressure your way into someone’s pants. Sex is supposed to be sexy, and coercion is not sexy. So if that’s your go-to tactic for maintaining your sex life, chance is you aren’t either.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos wants you to have your sex with a healthy helping of respect. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

My parents’ marriage (and divorce) involved cheating, and lots of it. I was first made aware of my mom’s adultery when I was 12. Finding out this negative and damaging information without a doubt assisted in shaping my views on cheating. I had no sympathy or understanding toward anyone who cheated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I became older and began to enter into my own intimate relationships, I carried with me an intense fear of being betrayed. Sure enough, the first guy I ever went out with cheated within the first couple of weeks of us dating. I couldn’t possibly understand how someone could so easily disrespect and violate another person like this. The answer seemed so simple to me: if you don’t want to be committed to one person, then don’t be in a relationship. To me, there was no excuse for it.

I’ve seen many others do it, go through it and I myself have even played a role in it. Up until recently I still had a pretty similar black-and-white perspective on it. Now, I think the issue might be a little more complex than I had originally thought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get me wrong; I still think cheating is horrible and potentially one of the most psychologically damaging things that can happen to a person. It can lower a person’s self-esteem beyond belief, forcing them to question their own self-worth and value. I’m still a huge proponent of not entering any sort of monogamous or committed relationship until one is sure they are willing to put forth the effort to make it work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I am now more understanding when it comes to making a judgment on someone’s infidelity. I no longer feel the need to say “once and a cheater, always a cheater” after hearing about someone’s indiscretions. I don’t think it’s necessarily right to label every person who falters with a giant, red “C.” I’ve realized life is more complicated than that. Relationships are more complicated than that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was younger, I thought for sure love was the only thing you need to make a relationship work. I thought out of all of the factors required, love was by far the most important. Now, I actually think it’s one of the least. Loving people is easy. Falling in love is easy. Relationships, on the other hand, are hard. They require a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice. Above all else, relationships are a choice. You don’t really choose to love someone; you just kind of do it, sometimes even when you don’t want to. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re in a relationship, you have to choose to respect that person. You have to choose to go home to them at night. You have to choose to forgo other options, options you might even think are better options. You have to choose them. Not everyone is in the position to make that choice. Some people just really can’t make that commitment, no matter how much they care about you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re one of these people who simply can’t commit, be honest about it. Accept that this is who you are, and don’t lead anyone to believe you’re different. Until you feel like you’re at a place in your life at which you are able to give someone the respect and loyalty they deserve, don’t try it. It only ends with dishonesty and disappointment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, people with commitment issues are not the only ones with the ability to cheat and betray. One of the most influencing factors in cheating is without a doubt alcohol. No matter who the person is, or however loyal they may be, alcohol changes things. It puts you in an altered state of mind in which your thoughts and decisions are no longer coherent or clear. I truly believe anyone can have a slip-up while under the influence of alcohol. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you’re one of these people who simply can’t commit, be honest about it. Accept that this is who you are, and don’t lead anyone to believe you’re different.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Anyone can say they’ll do their best to control themselves while intoxicated, but is that really enough? Does that really prove they have a true commitment to you? In my opinion, no. The real effort comes in the form of them choosing to not get so belligerent they put themselves in a situation that might jeopardize the relationship. The real effort comes in the form of maturity, when they choose to limit themselves out of respect for you.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, relationships are all about making choices. If your partner is truly serious about choosing you, they’ll choose to not black out when they’re not with you. They’ll choose to walk away from the bartender who’s flirting with them. They’ll choose not to answer that late-night phone call from their ex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheating is a matter of choice as well, but it’s not just about choosing not to cheat. It’s about choosing to draw boundaries and not cross them. It’s about choosing to be honest with your partner and yourself, no matter how difficult it may be. And most importantly, it’s about choosing to be OK with losing your other options because you’ve found a gain who’s worth the loss.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos wants you to be honest with yourself about what kind of love life is right for you. </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73654\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73654\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/","id":6342,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6341,6340,6339],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Casual Dating Becomes Not So Casual","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/casual-dating-art-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/casual-dating-art-1-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos shares her thoughts on the ups and down of casual relationships.

We without a doubt have more liberated, realistic, and open views on sexuality and love than the generations preceding us. This, like pretty much anything else, has its positives and negatives. For one, it helps to keep us more motivated to be independent and secure on our own. Two, it’s opened the floodgates for important conversation about sex and other topics that need to be discussed. And three, it allows for us to truly explore ourselves on a deeper level, before deciding to make a real commitment. Playing the field and discovering what you really desire out of life is great, but it’s not always as easy as it sounds.</p>\n<p>No matter how hard we try to “keep it casual” we’re still human beings with human emotions. Spending intimate time with someone WILL lead to some sort of intimate feeling. Disclosing information about yourself to others, and having others do the same to you, is an experience that WILL emotionally bond you. And no matter how hard we try to fight it, sex WILL make things more complicated.</p>\n<p>While our generation may be less naïve about certain aspects of relationships, we’re arrogantly ignorant when it comes to accepting the reality of our emotions. We constantly play with fire, blindly thinking that if the flame catches, we won’t be the one who gets burned. I mean, is there anything wrong with fuck buddies, FWB’s, or one-night-stands? In my opinion, no, not as long as you can handle what comes with the territory. Unfortunately, many of us can’t, but try to pretend like we can.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>In fact, anyone who actually thinks that they are above the simple human emotion of attachment is in for a rude awakening.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, doing the casual thing is not by any means impossible. Lots of people can do it, and they can love it, and they can be really good at it. But, everyone has his or her limitations. Everyone has the capacity to feel and to fall. In my opinion, accepting this reality is actually the first step to successfully being able to date casually. It’s important to know that you’re not invincible when going into any sort of sexual or romantic relationship.</p>\n<p>For some reason, our generation seems to have a tough time swallowing this pill. We equate having emotions with being co-dependent and weak. We would rather be called heartless than called clingy. We like sex, but pretend that we don’t like the person we have sex with.</p>\n<p>These are all bullshit ideologies that our generation unsuccessfully tries to follow. While we tend to think that these assist in some sort of self-preservation, they are frankly just unrealistic, selfish, and immature. I don’t know who we think we’re fooling. In fact, anyone who actually thinks that they are above the simple human emotion of attachment is in for a rude awakening. If you don’t believe me, keep reading, because I was just like you not too long ago.</p>\n<p>My journey of sex and relationships took off with a rocky start. I went through various phases of being extremely naïve, to being extremely ignorant about my own feelings. I went from thinking I was supposed to have sex with one person my whole life, to quickly trying to discount sex as being nothing more than a physical act.</p>\n<p>After acquiring a bit more life and sexual experience, I thought that I had a pretty solid perspective on the whole thing. I thought that sex could mean more than just sex, but only if I was going to let it. I thought, that I could have complete control over my feelings, and whom they were for. So, this summer, I had a goal. My goal was to have as much fun as possible, with no strings attached during my last summer as a college student.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I became overwhelmed and spread too thin. Things changed, feelings were hurt, and like always, I learned something new.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A guy that I had hoped for a second chance with was going to be gone until September, so it was the perfect opportunity for me to be carefree and uninhibited. Then, after a summer full of frivolous fun, maybe I would have my chance at something more real.</p>\n<p>About two weeks into July, I met a new someone. Someone who was supposed to be moving far away in a couple of months. Someone who wasn’t in any position to be starting any sort of relationship. It was perfect. We got to know each other, had a lot of fun, and before I even realized what was happening, this person became my best friend. I had never been treated with such respect, care, or intensity. Things began to move fast and suddenly I was completely invested. As the weeks continued, feelings evolved, plans changed, things became more serious, and then it was September.</p>\n<p>I ended up getting what I had hoped for. A second chance with someone that I wasn’t sure would give me one. The only problem was that my “casual summer fling” wasn’t so casual anymore. At first I thought I could handle it. I thought I could juggle all of the emotions and confusion that I was experiencing. I thought that I could do the casual thing, with two people who I already had invested feelings in, until I absolutely needed to make a decision.</p>\n<p>As I enjoyed the attention and confidence of having two guys wanting to be around, I felt invincible. I thought that for sure, I wasn’t going to be in any position to get hurt. I actually thought that I was in a great position to be in. I had options. Two guys who I really liked, two guys who I enjoyed spending time with.</p>\n<p>The disappointing reality of my attempt at casual dating hit me after a couple of weeks of trying to juggle my various emotions. It couldn’t be done. I became overwhelmed and spread too thin. Things changed, feelings were hurt, and like always, I learned something new. I learned that casual dating is possible, but only if you actually keep things casual.</p>\n<p>I learned that no matter how much you tell yourself that you won’t fall, sometimes you do. I learned that toying with serious feelings and promises leads to hurt. And I learned that no matter how hard you try to control things, they just don’t always fall into place the way you think they will.</p>\n<p>While this experience was not what I thought it would be, it gave me the tools that I needed to figure how I can do casual dating the right way for me. Everyone is different; everyone has different expectations and different needs. As for me, I now know what my limitations are. I now know that I can in fact do the casual thing, but only with one person at a time. I now know that when casually dating, I can allow myself to fall a little bit, knowing that I very well might get hurt in the end. And I now know how I want to be treated and how I want to treat others, even when dating casually.</p>\n<p>So, if you think casual dating might be right for you, try it. Just remember: you’re not an emotionless robot that is impervious to feelings (no matter how hard you try), always be honest with yourself about what it is that you truly want, regardless of how you feel it will make you look to others, and most importantly, remember that casual dating is above all else, supposed to be fun. So go out there, and enjoy it.</p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos encourages you to have fun without forgetting that feelings are real. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/","id":6308,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6307,6306,6305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Drunken Emotions, a Sobering Reality and Getting Screwed","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dailyhump.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dailyhump.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos warns against holding past experiences against new people. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This weekend, I learned a few unexpected and completely mortifying life lessons. It all stemmed from the fact that I decided to drown my unwanted emotions in tequila. I know that drinking to cope with emotion is unhealthy, but I also know we all make mistakes. Well, unfortunately for me, the mistakes I made this weekend will probably haunt me for a while. Not just because of the humiliation that I feel, but also because of the disappointing things I learned about myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, I’ve always thought of myself as being pretty well-rounded. Since I was about five years old, I can remember being told that I’m an old soul, that I’m incredibly mature and that I have a bright future ahead of me. I moved out of my dad’s house when I was 18, and then moved across the country when I was 20. I make good grades, I have an internship that I love and I’m surrounded by an amazing group of family and friends who support me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’ve never been hesitant to follow my dreams, and success has always seemed attainable to me. However, my biggest struggle that has plagued me since I turned 16 is my ability to maintain any sort of intimate relationship. I had always thought it was just because I’d been dealt a really shitty hand and that my taste in men was awful. After this weekend, I have come to the disappointing conclusion that a lot of the problem actually lies within myself.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I was surrounded by romance and cuteness, listening to stories of first kisses and first times. I watched adorable “promposals” and saw countless candid photos of teens in love on my Instagram. At the time, I wasn’t really envious. I actually thought they were all idiots. Maybe my parents’ dysfunctional marriage made me bitter, or maybe I was repressing my jealousy at the lack of affection in my life. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of why, I didn’t feel like I was missing out on much. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the back of my mind, I knew these dramatic and naïve relationships wouldn’t last long after graduation. Then, right before the start of my senior year, I experienced my first real, intimate relationship. It was not cute, it was not romantic, and it was nothing like my friends’. It was damaging, abusive and emotionally traumatic. It was my first and only real encounter with any sort of romantic or sexual feeling. And, after it abruptly ended, it was the only thing I knew. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two years that followed this relationship were a complete and utter mess. With this newfound heartbreak and my parents’ ongoing divorce, I felt completely out of control. I turned to partying and casual sex, thinking it would make me look less pathetic or weak. If anything, it did the exact opposite. Every relationship that followed was a rollercoaster, going from being extremely great to utterly sorrowful and back around again. I don’t even think I liked the guys that I was spending my time with, but I needed to feel some sort of validation from them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even after starting college, the relationships were all distorted and tumultuous. Eventually, being sad felt more comfortable than being happy. In my head, each guy was the same, and I knew that soon enough I would be screwed over and left to feel unworthy. I was dealing with conflicting emotions of frustration, shame and embarrassment. I couldn’t believe that I had let these guys affect me in such a negative way, even to the extent of doubting my own self-worth. Then I got my acceptance letter to UCSB, and I knew I would get a clean slate.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been about nine months since I transferred here. I love it even more than I ever thought I would. However, I naively and blindly assumed that moving far away from the people in my past would mean that the baggage I carry would stay behind as well. A few weeks ago, I met a guy that was unbelievably sweet and goofy. Not really the type of person you’d expect to meet at a frat party. At first, I thought he was totally safe and not someone I would really be that interested in. Then, after getting to know him better, the unsettling realization that I might actually like him set in.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Treat every new person in your life with a clean slate, regardless of who hurt you in the past, try not to let your reaction be an overreaction and stay the hell away from Jose Cuervo.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Long story short, I panicked. I was already so on edge about my own feelings that I sabotaged the entire thing over a minuscule action. I got drunk, made a complete ass of myself, and the only person I can blame is me. I was completely disrespectful and crazy to someone who had given me no reason to act in such a way. Someone who had been nothing but sweet to me. Someone whose company I was really beginning to enjoy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here I am again, feeling sorry for myself. Only this time, it’s way worse. Because this time, I have to face the fact that I screwed myself. I screwed myself out of something that had potential to actually be good. I screwed myself out of making a real connection with someone. I screwed myself before even giving him the chance to screw up. If anything good is going to come out of this humiliation and regret, then I guess it’s the fact that I’ll never turn to alcohol for advice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll never project old relationships onto new ones. I’ll never blame someone for my unhappiness before look at my own actions. And I’ll never again let insecurities from my past drive the decisions that I make in the present. Learning things the hard way is … well … hard. There’s nothing fun about it. But, if this is what I needed in order to grow up, accept responsibility and move forward, then so be it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you don’t want to end up like me, listening to Mumford and Sons’ “Little Lion Man” on repeat and feeling like a total idiot, then take my advice. Treat every new person in your life with a clean slate, regardless of who hurt you in the past, try not to let your reaction be an overreaction and stay the hell away from Jose Cuervo.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos your rough past won’t keep you from a bright future. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/","id":6303,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6302,6301,6300],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Having ‘Condom’ Sense","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4-condom270112-de.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4-condom270112-de.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos brings attention to the decision of whether or not to use a condom during sex.

I mean, who isn’t slightly disturbed yet intrigued after first hearing about “the birds and the bees?”</p>\n<p>As I flipped through the beauty ads and fashion tips, I came across a section titled, “5 Lies He’ll Say To Get in Your Pants.” At the time this seemed like immensely valuable information, so I decided to read it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first “lie” was extremely obvious; giving the old “he’ll only say I love you to sleep with you!” rant. I had heard that one from my grandmother since I was about five, so I felt pretty equipped to handle that. However, the second one caught me by major surprise. It talked about how a guy might tell me, “I don’t want to use a condom because then I can’t feel anything.” Being that the majority of my sexual knowledge came from sex-ed, I was totally shell-shocked.</p>\n<p>I mean, after learning of all of the horrors that can come with an unwanted pregnancy or STD, what kind of idiot would say they don’t want to use a condom just because it doesn’t feel as good? Isn’t that why Trojan makes “Ultra Thin?” In my baffled state I reasoned that I would never be interested in a guy that would be that selfish or idiotic. About three years later, when I became sexually active, I was forced to face the hard truth about boys and condoms.</p>\n<p>Nearly every guy that I’ve encountered in the bedroom has attempted to sleep with me without using a condom. Some of them were long-term relationships, others … not so much. My first experience was obviously blinding and scary like it is for most young men and women. The guy was a little older than me, and much more experienced. Therefore, I put all of my trust into him, thinking he knew what was best.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nearly every guy that I’ve encountered in the bedroom has attempted to sleep with me without using a condom.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was never one of those girls that thought that I would want to wait until marriage for sex; I’ve always been somewhat of a realist. But I definitely thought I would always be extremely responsible and NEVER risk getting an STD or pregnant.</p>\n<p>Then, the first time I had sex, I allowed the guy to convince me that a condom wasn’t necessary. He told me, “You can’t get pregnant the first time you have sex,” a lie I stupidly believed. Luckily, I didn’t get pregnant and I didn’t catch an STD. However, I did lose a sense of confidence and independence that was very important when making any big decisions. The fact that I had given in so easily, without really thinking twice, made me question how secure I was in myself. They say that before you can truly care about anyone else, you have to be able to care for you. If I had truly been secure in myself, I would have stuck to my standards and made him wear a condom, regardless of his excuses.</p>\n<p>Since then I have gained enough experience to come to the realization that many guys will try to get by without using condoms. At first, I thought that my taste in men had just taken a completely wrong turn; but after talking to a handful of girlfriends, I realized that it’s much more common than not. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the guy who tries to sleep with you minus a condom is a disgusting, selfish asshole; it just means that he might not think he has as much to lose.</p>\n<p>When an unwanted pregnancy occurs, the woman is the one who truly faces the most adversaries. Her body is the one being forced to undergo some sort of drastic measure, whether it is to have an abortion or carry a baby to term. She is the one who has to make the difficult and life-altering decision.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When an unwanted pregnancy occurs, the woman is the one who truly faces the most adversaries.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While a man endures various struggles that may come with getting a girl pregnant, they’re not nearly as severe. In regards to STDs, it still surprises me that guys often seem to feel invincible to them. I mean HIV, herpes and chlamydia don’t discriminate based on gender. However, women do actually have a few more things to worry about when it comes to STDs. HPV (human papillomavirus) has several strains that can cause cervical cancer in women. The results can be deadly, especially since symptoms rarely show.</p>\n<p>The terrifying part is that the majority of sexually active men carry HPV, yet don’t realize it considering it doesn’t affect them. If a carrier of HPV has unprotected sex with someone, the consequences can be severe. In addition, curable STDs such as chlamydia can cause infertility in women when left untreated. These are a couple of reasons why men may be more relaxed when it comes to the necessity of a condom</p>\n<p>While they can sometimes be inconvenient, annoying and tedious, there really is no good enough reason for a man to state that he doesn’t want to use a condom. Unless both you and your partner have been tested and have access to other forms of birth control, no one has any business claiming that a condom is not necessary. If you’re a woman who is not comfortable having sex without a condom, stick to your standards and do not budge. It’s you’re body, and you’re the one who may have the most to lose. While guys may think it’s just not that big of deal in the moment, it definitely will be in the long run.</p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos asks you to condone the condom.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/","id":6305,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6304,6303,6302],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How Girls Can Ease Their Morning After","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos shares some tips on how to make a potentially awkward morning a little more comfortable.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As a woman, waking up the “morning after” can sometimes be a lot more stressful than romantic. Unless you’re in a serious or long-term relationship, you most likely haven’t reached that level of comfortability where waking up with makeup smeared and teeth unbrushed are normal and pleasant. Those awkward moments experienced during the morning after, where you can feel insecure, unprepared and just downright annoyed, can all be diminished by carrying these four small items in your purse.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Condom(s):</em> This is probably the most important item to have in your bag if you think that you might be going home with someone. Common misconception and stereotype says that the guy should always have the condom. This ideology is unbelievably outdated and can have dangerous consequences. Once you’ve started hooking up and reach a certain point, it becomes pretty hard to stop. Therefore, if you’re making out with someone and you’ve both decided that you want to have sex, yet neither of you have a condom, you might make the impulsive decision to have intercourse without protection.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Common misconception and stereotype says that the guy should always have the condom.

To ensure that you take all steps necessary to prevent that uncomfortable dissonance experienced in the morning, it’s best to just always buy and carry your own condoms.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Mints:</em> One of my least favorite things about waking up next to someone in the morning is the fact that I have to be near someone before I’ve had the chance to brush my teeth. If you wake up in a new partner’s home, it can be super annoying to have to quietly get up, find the bathroom and locate their toothpaste, only to have to use your finger to brush your teeth (because carrying a toothbrush would be somewhat excessive). If you’re lucky, they might be a mouthwash kind of person, and you can just steal a swig of Listerine.</p>\n<p>However, just to be safe, I find it easiest to always carry either gum or mints. Anything really will do, whether it’s Altoids or Extra, just make sure you have something. You can quietly reach into your purse, pop one in and relinquish the taste of morning. Word of caution: sometimes mints are a better choice over gum, simply because mints dissolve while gum doesn’t. Therefore, if your partner wakes up and tries to spontaneously kiss you, it can be slightly awkward if you’re chomping on some Orbit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70645\" style=\"width: 467px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70645\" data-attachment-id=\"70645\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/morning-after-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?fit=1360%2C1927&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1360,1927\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"morning after art\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?fit=176%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?fit=723%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70645 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=457%2C647\" alt=\"Art by Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus \" width=\"457\" height=\"647\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?w=1360&amp;ssl=1 1360w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=176%2C250&amp;ssl=1 176w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=768%2C1088&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=723%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70645\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Art by Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>A comb:</em> If you have long, thick hair like me, you know that more often than not, it is possible to wake up with a rat’s nest on top of your head. Sex definitely doesn’t help. After a night of … fornication, a girl’s hair is not bound to look the same as it did the night before. The curls have unraveled and the hairspray has gone awry. It can get tangled, knotted and just be downright frustrating to deal with in the morning, especially when you’re not in your own home with your own things.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">After a night of … fornication, a girl’s hair is not bound to look the same as it did the night before.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">OK, I know a comb is not nearly as effective as a brush; however, carrying an actual brush around in a small bag is neither always ideal nor possible.

Mascara, eyeliner, blush, etc., are all great but way too excessive and annoying to carry around. The truth is, very few people look picture perfect in the mornings. Yet, simply having some cover-up or foundation to put under your eyes, or cover last night’s smeared makeup, can take away some of those insecurities you might experience when seeing a new partner not-so-fresh faced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is, all of the above listed items, besides a condom (ALWAYS CARRY ONE), are superficial amenities that aren’t by any means necessary, but can alleviate some of the uncomfortable annoyances that come with spending the night out. While the person you wake up to should never expect you to look like Sleeping Beauty awaking from her slumber, these easy tips can make your morning after experience much more enjoyable and relaxed.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos hopes these tips make it so you never have to stress the next morning again.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/","id":6304,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6303,6302,6301],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Cuddling Turns to Smothering","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cuddle-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cuddle-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos talks boundaries when it comes to that thing we do when the weather is bad.

If you’re just sleeping with someone, no strings attached, should you cuddle after sex? Doesn’t cuddling imply some sort of emotional attachment? While it would seem that the act of getting naked and having sex would be much more intimidating than simply spooning, this isn’t always the case.  Obviously, the best way to avoid this uncertainty is to ensure that you and your partner are both on the same page in regards to what you’re wanting out of your relationship. While unwanted snuggling can be awkward, it’s not nearly as bad as being scurried out after just giving yourself to someone intimately. Once your intentions have been established, it’s important to make sure that your cuddling doesn’t cross boundaries that can turn it into smothering.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>Honestly, who can truly get a good night’s sleep with someone else literally breathing down your neck? Do you not overheat from having another person’s body attach onto your own?</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I enjoy the occasional cuddling. It can feel comforting and reassuring, especially when a romantic connection is involved. However, when it comes to sleeping, I prefer to maintain my own space. My all-time favorite sleeping position is by far on my side. I feel like it gives me the opportunity to be the most flexible, as well as being the optimal positioning for temperature control (one leg out of the covers, one leg in, etc.). However, I’ve come to the realization that this position seems to appear as an invitation for spooning when laying in bed with someone else, especially post-sex. Originally, I figured the body language associated with this position was, “Ok, I’ve rolled over away from you now, don’t touch me.” Unfortunately, I have been proven wrong. Honestly, who can truly get a good night’s sleep with someone else literally breathing down your neck? Do you not overheat from having another person’s body attach onto your own? Especially in Isla Vista, where air conditioning is basically non-existent, how does anyone deal with the sweltering conditions that come with having someone lay basically all of their body weight on top of you? It’s a phenomenon that I can’t seem to figure out, along with handholding. I think holding hands when cuddling is sweet and romantic, but when you’re trying to pass out, it’s not exactly ideal. It’s rather restricting and uncomfortable. Having your fingers intertwined with anyone else’s while unconscious doesn’t seem pleasant, nor safe, especially if you roll around a lot like me. I completely understand wanting to show affection after hooking up, and I firmly believe that it helps to create and sustain a bond, but at the same time, a restful slumber is not something to be compromised.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Of course the feeling of waking up next to a loved one is beautiful and sensual, but no one looks good at 7 a.m.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Cuddling can also take a wrong turn the morning after; when you’ve just woken up groggy, unprepared and unattractive. Of course the feeling of waking up next to a loved one is beautiful and sensual, but no one looks good at 7 a.m.  You have yet to freshen up your hair and face. You have yet to brush your teeth. And chances are, you probably really have to pee. It can be unbelievably unpleasant to be woken up with an embrace, especially when it’s unexpected. Mornings are meant to be peaceful, easy and slow, not awkward and stressful. Waking up to being grabbed and kissed is sometimes startling and quite honestly, annoying. I prefer to have a little bit of time to collect myself and come together before being overwhelmed with tenderness and care. After I’ve gargled some Listerine and fully come to, I think some morning-time endearment is great. But until then, I need some space to start my day off right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of what your relationship status is, some people find post-sex cuddling to be a necessity, while others can do without it. I personally think finding a healthy balance is the best route to go. Boundaries are necessary in every aspect of a relationship, even when it comes to something as small as cuddling. Finding that comfortable middle can help ensure that you still feel desired and loved, without feeling suffocated. </span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos advocates for a healthy amount of cuddling, done at the right time. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69833\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69833\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/","id":6301,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6300,6299,6298],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sex Over Spring Break… The Safe Way","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spring-break-sex.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spring-break-sex.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos encourages you to think before you hop into bed over spring break.

This is every college student’s dream. This is Spring Break. It is the one week out of the year when losing your dignity and class is socially acceptable, and somewhat expected. Whether you stay in I.V. (where it’s basically Spring Break every week) or make your way to Mexico or Panama City Beach for some traditional Spring Break festivities, you’re guaranteed some crazy stories and fun memories. However, with great fun comes great responsibility. When combining heavy drinking and large quantities of attractive, but belligerent college students, it’s important to be alert and aware so that your Spring Break experience doesn’t turn sour. Wouldn’t you rather come home with a nice tan rather than a not-so-nice rash?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hooking up on Spring Break can be exciting and sexy for many reasons. The most obvious being that you will most likely never see the person ever again. The aroma of boxed wine, cigarette smoke and lack of commitment has a certain appeal to it. While these spontaneous affairs can be exhilarating and fun, it’s important to keep your wits about you. I learned this the hard way. Last year during Spring Break, I went on a trip to Panama City Beach, Florida (aka Spring Break capital of the world) with a group of my friends from Texas. I knew it would be an insane trip, and I couldn’t wait. The first couple of days were a blast. I was the perfect amount of drunk to enjoy the utter chaos that is PCB, yet still coherent and functioning. On our third day there, I drank way too much at the beach. I don’t remember how or when I got back to my hotel, but I woke up on a lawn chair on our hotel balcony. After waking up completely disoriented, and still hammered, my friends and I continued to drink in order to get ready for the bars. Pretty much everything that happens after that is extremely blurry. I apparently decided to take a shower after already having my hair and makeup done, and when I got out of the shower, there was a group of German students in my hotel room. I know, completely random. Turns out these guys were our hotel neighbors, and my friends had invited them over to pregame with us. In my intoxicated state, I struck up somewhat of a conversation with one of the guys that I thought was attractive (I say somewhat because he didn’t really speak English, and I could barely form sentences). After a very short amount of time, I ended up bed with him, and I have very little recollection of what happened. The only thing I remember is making him put on a new condom every three minutes because I was so scared that we weren’t using one. If I couldn’t even be aware enough of the fact that we were using protection, there is absolutely no reason why I should have been having sex. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After sobering up and realizing what I had done, I felt horrible. I had never had a sexual experience like that, and I was completely disappointed in my actions and judgment. I knew it was completely irresponsible and dangerous to get that drunk, but I did it anyway. Had I been more aware of my actions, I never would have slept with someone who was basically a stranger while completely belligerent. I knew I had no one to blame except myself. Even though I was much too drunk to be making the choice to have sex, he was as well, and we both willingly engaged in the act. It was a poor decision fueled by a lack of rational thought. After finding out that we did for sure use protection, I felt much better about the situation, but still disappointed. I began to realize that something much worse could have happened. Every year, horrible assault and rape stories emerge on the news from Spring Break. Just this past year, at the same location that I was at, a girl was raped by a group of guys on a public beach in front of a ton of students. The horrible crime was even filmed by cowardly, idiotic kids. The girl was completely unconscious as she was assaulted and violated. While the rape was 100 percent the fault of the rapists, the fact that other students didn’t intervene in the situation due to their partying and alcohol consumption is absolutely asinine. As sad as it is, our society has perpetuated this idea that rape is “normal” or “acceptable.” Rather than helping, people aimlessly watched and ignored a cruel act committed against a clearly vulnerable person in need. It is truly sad that we live in a society that promotes teaching women “how to not be raped or assaulted,” rather than teaching others to simply “not rape or assault.” However, until that changes, it is important to not make yourself even more vulnerable to those unthinkable acts, whether you’re male or female.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being uncontrollably intoxicated is neither safe nor fun for many reasons. For one, you may make a regrettable and scary decision such as I did, or, you may lose valuable intuition and defenses that can help protect you when facing a threatening situation. Secondly, sex is so much better when you feel comfortable, secure and certain. Trust me. Spring Break is supposed to be one of the best weeks of the year, so know your limits, party hard and make the most of it. Oh, and as tempting as beaded necklaces can be, don’t flash your boobs for Snapchat. Those pictures will haunt you. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68735\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68735\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/","id":6299,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6298,6297,6296],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/395"}},"__N_SSG":true}
