This year’s finalists featured augmented reality video-conferencing business Caugnate, chemotherapy diagnostics company Chemoguard, marketing analytics startup Insiight, hotel door key app Sesamo, cricket flour-producing business Slightly Nutty and the NVC winners, Milo.</p>\n<p>For the “tech-driven” award category, startups Chemoguard and Cognate split second place and Milo won first place, while Slightly Nutty and Sesamo split second place and Insiight won first place in the “market-pull” category. Milo also won the $10,000 grand prize and $2,500 People’s Choice Award, while Chemogaurd won the $5,000 Elings Prize.</p>\n<p>NVC sponsor, venture capitalist and alumnus Jason Spievak, whose software company Invoca hires mostly Gaucho graduates, said the NVC Finals present a vital opportunity for investors to discover promising young potential startups.</p>\n<p>“There’s lots of great stuff coming out of UCSB, and the depth and scope of the engineering talent here compared to when I was in school has become very impressive,” Spievak said. “From a material science perspective, it’s now the number one school in the world.”</p>\n<p>According to Spievak, the NVC develops industry and job production for the benefit of the local and global community.</p>\n<p>“Locally, it creates jobs and it keeps people in Santa Barbara, which is a win,” Spievak said. “Globally there are those occasional technologies like Integrated Fluidics that truly have the potential to save a lot of lives and change the world, and those are innovations that are happening right here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Milo member and computer science graduate student Daniel Imberman said his startup is already in talks with an incubator featuring a technology host angel, and that all his group members are interested in moving the business forward.</p>\n<p>“The high point was the second we got that first working trial,” Imberman said. “Up until then I was just kind of not sure what we were doing was going to amount to anything, but once I saw that data chart it was like, ‘Oh my god. We actually have something.’”</p>\n<p>According to Imberman, participating in the NVC has allowed him to gain knowledge and experience that transcends traditional business and technology curriculum.</p>\n<p>“I’ve learned more and worked more in the past three months than I have I the past two years,” Imberman said. “I’ve had daily 8 a.m. to midnight days. If I wasn’t in school, I was working on this all the time. Honestly even if we hadn’t won a dime I would’ve walked out with so much more business knowledge and just ready to attack the world based on this one competition.”</p>\n<p>Fourth year biochemistry major and Chemogaurd member Letitia Mueller, the only female finalist to win an award in the tech-driven category, said if her startup receives seed capital, it could “open up a whole new world of how to do chemotherapy.”</p>\n<p>“If we have a way to make chemo more effective, we could have people survive through chemo with higher dosages,” Mueller said. “If they can tolerate them or avoid the drugs they can’t tolerate, then that makes chemo more efficient and improves quality of life and reduces costs.”</p>\n<p>Mueller is one of three females to have made it to the NVC finals, along with graduate student in the Bren School of Environmental Science Megan Miranda of Slightly Nutty, who tied for the second place award in the market-pull category, and psychology graduate student Katie Koehler of Insiight, who won first place in market-pull.</p>\n<p>According to Mueller, the lack of female representation in the competition reflects an overall male-dominant trend in the tech industry that she hopes to see eliminated in years to come.</p>\n<p>“People sometimes don’t understand the gravity of the situation when you are one of the few women in your field.” Mueller said. “That being said, it’s really important for women to realize that there are so many avenues you can go down that haven’t been travelled by females. Why is the NVC 90 percent male dominated? It shouldn’t have to be that way.”</p>\n<p><em>[<strong>Correction:</strong> A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Letitia Mueller was the only female to win the New Venture Competition Finals. In actuality, finalists Megan Miranda of Slightly Nutty and Katie Koehler of Insiight won awards in the “market-pull” category. </em></p>\n<p><em>Also, a previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Jason Spievak as referencing to a company called Asta Fluidics instead of the correct </em><em>Integrated Fluidics.

climb all fourteen 8,000 meter mountain peaks without the use of supplementary oxygen, spoke at Campbell Hall Tuesday night about her 8,611 meter trek up K2, the second highest mountain in the world.</p>\n<p>A skiing, ice climbing and mountaineering enthusiast from the age of 13, Kaltenbrunner used her money working as an oncology nurse to fund her climbing expeditions until climbing the Nanga Parbat in 2003 and finally deciding to mountain climb professionally. As the last leg of Arts &amp; Lecture’s “National Geographic Live” series, Kaltenbrunner’s lecture was accompanied by photography and video to supplement her narrative recounting of trekking up her last 8,000 meter mountain peak: K2.</p>\n<p>Prior to reaching K2’s summit in 2011, Kaltenbrunner had attempted to climb the mountain’s peak six previous times.</p>\n<p>“Six times I had to turn back just before reaching the highest point. Despite those six returns, K2 still resided in my heart,” Kaltenbrunner said.</p>\n<p>For her seventh attempt up the world’s second largest mountain, Kaltenbrunner decided she would bypass the conventional route up the south side of the mountain from Pakistan via the Cesen Route, and would instead go up the North Pillar from China.</p>\n<p>“I had decided for the very unconventional way,” Kaltenbrunner said. “I chose a very difficult route on K2— the North Pillar, a very, very beautiful plane up to the highest point. This is a very challenging way up.”</p>\n<p>During her lecture, Kaltenbrunner detailed the process by which her team — comprised of herself and four men — travelled to the base of K2 from China by crossing the hazardous Shanksgam River on camelback, then proceeded to spend 80 days setting up base, acclimating their bodies to the extremely high altitudes and climbing up the icy, windy, subzero mountainside.</p>\n<p>“[At times] it was far too cold. We couldn’t feel our fingers anymore … It was so difficult for us to stay whole nights in the tiny tent. It was hard to go out,” Kaltenbrunner said. “But when I did go out it was just amazing. We had such beautiful nights, very clear nights full of stars. As you can imagine, up there, there is no light pollution. Many times I could see, from the light of the stars, the shadow from my own body. It’s amazing up there.”</p>\n<p>Kaltenbrunner said what she had felt after reaching K2’s peak and fulfilling one of her life-long dreams was indescribable.</p>\n<p>“In order to successfully reach your goals, and it doesn’t matter which goals they are, you have to be enthusiastic,” Kaltenbrunner said. “Prepare yourself mentally for unforeseeable situations. Maintain calm and serenity in situations that seem to be hopeless … Never give up. Hope that everything will work out in the end. And most importantly, respect nature and follow your own path.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Cody Sturges said the most striking thing about Kaltenbrunner’s lecture were the images of her on the summit and the accounts of her 80-day climbing expedition.</p>\n<p>“The sheer distance she put toward that goal and then finally accomplishing it, it’s really something special,” Stuges said. “The most important thing is to never give up. She kept pushing; she made it.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara native and Ventura resident Joe Norris, Kaltenbrunner’s ability to fight through adversity and approach situations with meticulous preparation are principles that can be applied to everyday goals.</p>\n<p>“Getting a degree or passing a test, setting your goals, being passionate about it — that’s what you can draw from every day experiences,” Norris said. “Just climbing the mountain of life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/record-breaking-mountaineer-speaks-at-campbell/","id":2758,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[2757,2756,2755],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lucidity Festival","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-12.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-12.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"This year’s Lucidity arts and music festival was nothing short of magic.

From offering live instrumental music and electronic bass music to unbelievably beautiful art installations and stunning dance and theater performances to healing and growing workshops and more, this past weekend’s three-day arts and music festival did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>Held in Santa Barbara’s own backyard within the Santa Ynez mountains, Lucidity invited attendees to bask in a whirlwind of the sickest of fine art, the dopest of musical talent and the most stimulating of multi-sensory experiences. With a commitment to sustainability, environmental responsibility, community reciprocity and personal growth, Lucidity offered participants an opportunity to creatively and artistically co-create the open-source, transformational arts and music festival of their dreams.</p>\n<p>The first night of the festival, Berkeley-based electronic producer Thriftworks headlined the main stage with explosive, beat-crafting modern bass and eclectic synth samples along to a Technicolor laser lightshow unparalleled by many other concert lightshows on the West Coast. Concurrently, the world instrument/beat duo Dirtwire mesmerized audiences with sultry, traditional world music and roots tunes, sporting a myriad of instruments like the kalimba, the sitar and other obscure, mostly Middle Eastern instruments.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>According to Lucidity Co-Founder and Marketing Director Jonah Haas, along with showcasing musical stages, themed camping villages, sustainable and organic local food stands, a curated art gallery and workshops, Lucidity this year was all about community and education.</p>\n<p>“Lucidity is a place for students of the Great Mystery, students of life,” Haas said. “Lucidity is a place where magic is real, where authentic community connection is easy, and where you might learn some things that are not taught in traditional schools. There’s a ton of really inspiring educational content this year.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, a particularly notable facet of the festival had everything to do with the music. Headliner and glitch hop DJ the Polish Ambassador, a musician who also happens to be spearheading a nationwide sustainability education program called “Pushing Through The Pavement Tour,” has been traveling the nation introducing communities to permaculture design processes. The workshops include introductions to rainwater harvesting, natural building, regenerative techniques, permaculture gardening, composting, ecological principles and more.</p>\n<p>Permaculture Action Course community organizer Ryan Rising, who worked at the Permaculture Action Hub at the festival last weekend, said Lucidity offered festival-goers the opportunity to learn about everything related to permaculture — including regenerative ecology, social change, community organizing and more — for free.</p>\n<p>According to Rising, Lucidity Permaculture Action Hub staff would start teaching workshops in the morning for the first couple hours of the festival with children’s education and youth permaculture education, and then would move on to DIY skill-shares, as well as “more hands-on stuff” such as making botanical medicine, lessons on how to make kombuchas, fermented sodas and even environmentally-friendly soaps and deodorants.</p>\n<p>“Today we’re going to have an introduction to permaculture, a soils and compost workshop, followed by rain-water harvesting techniques,” Rising said, prepping for a long day of teaching while under a multi-colored cloth awning at the festival. “There’s a rewilding workshop, and a social permaculture panel discussion later on. At night we end everything off with a mycelial mixer, a networking party for permaculture folks.”</p>\n<p>Lucidity’s penchant toward substantive, forward-thinking sustainability is no secret, as big-time publications have begun to turn their eyes and ears toward the festival’s progressive efforts.</p>\n<p>“The feedback has been really amazing,” Rising said. “We got into the <em>Huffington Post</em> for the permaculture action course.”</p>\n<p>These efforts coincide with Lucidity’s recent decision to reduce attendees after Santa Barbara County asked the organization to reduce their overall capacity numbers due to concerns about the festival’s ecological impact, including the Santa Ynez Valley’s drought cycle as well as the impact of parking by cars on top of oak tree roots.</p>\n<p>“The biggest challenge has been reducing our car camping option. Last year we had 1100 cars up onsite. This year, it’s looking like we will have less than 500,” Haas said. “Making this sort of reduction when people have come to expect certain things is difficult. But we look forward to there being more space onsite and less crowding.”</p>\n<p>It is this very dedication to “Leaving It Better” that makes Lucidity a gratifyingly unique experience, leaving festival-goers with a sense of social responsibility along with memories many may not remember, with people they’ll never forget.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that horrified me the one time I went to Coachella was how everyone just threw their trash all over the grounds. I have the image of tractors piling up mountains of single-use plastic bottles when they turned the lights on at night,” Haas said. “Lucidity endeavors to be as sustainable and environmentally responsible as possible. We have a variety of initiatives that reduce our footprint and extend a deeper respect for the land.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYn4-_KR3MY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_62476\" style=\"width: 407px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1613991783\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62548\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62476\" data-attachment-id=\"62476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/lucidity-festival/lucidity_emily-rogers-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?fit=397%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"397,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428709661\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"1400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lucidity_Emily Rogers-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?fit=397%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62476\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?resize=397%2C600\" alt=\"Emily Rogers/Daily Nexus\" width=\"397\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?w=397&amp;ssl=1 397w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62476\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Emily Rogers</em>/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The progressive electronic music artist is known for his dreamy and celestial sound, his phenomenal, climactic drumming and an unforgettably iconic electroluminescent mask. While Slow Magic prefers to keep his identity under wraps, it’s no secret that this forward-thinking DJ, reminiscent of artists like Odesza, Flume, Giraffage and XXYYXX, is one of the most artful and crafty underground electronic music producers to look out for this year. The <em>Daily Nexus</em> was lucky enough to catch the ever-elusive Colorado-native without his mask on and — after approaching with caution — caught a one-on-one interview with the man with “no name.”</p>\n<p><strong>Carissa Quiambao:</strong> Are you Slow Magic?</p>\n<p><strong>Slow Magic:</strong> Yeah!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>CQ:</strong> Is your name ******?</p>\n<p><em>(Prior to the interview</em>,<em> the </em>Daily Nexus <em>obtained Slow Magic’s real name but cannot disclose it to protect the interviewee’s anonymity.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>SM:</strong> No … but don’t tell anyone.</p>\n<p><strong>CQ:</strong> Aha, okay.

Do you always strive to play shows at venues that are small and intimate?</p>\n<p><strong>SM:</strong> I kind of just play wherever I can, but this place definitely has an awesome vibe and I’m always happy to play in places that look cool like this. I hear there’s an after party somewhere else, but I think I’m just gonna stick around here since I’m staying at this hotel tonight.</p>\n<p><strong>CQ:</strong> Good call, this place is indeed awesome. But okay, I have to ask — why the mask? How did you come to start wearing it?</p>\n<p><strong>SM:</strong> I want my shows to be more about the music and art than about the person playing it. So I had someone custom-make the mask for me. His name is Jonas and he’s super talented.</p>\n<p><strong>CQ:</strong> Does it ever get difficult to perform with the mask on?</p>\n<p><strong>SM:</strong> Yeah, it definitely gets warm and stuffy in there. But it’s worth it.</p>\n<p><strong>CQ:</strong> Agreed! So, who are your musical inspirations?</p>\n<p><strong>SM:</strong> That’s a tough one! I like a lot of different kinds of music, but I think I’d have to say Sigur Rós is one of my big inspirations, and I really like Kings of Convenience.</p>\n<p><strong>CQ:</strong> Nice. And your favorite food? Favorite TV show?</p>\n<p><strong>SM:</strong> I like Japanese food. My favorite TV show right now is … “Parks and Rec” because the show just ended. The last season was awesome.</p>\n<p><strong>CQ:</strong> Alright, last question — what’s one thing you would like to tell all your fans right now?</p>\n<p><strong>SM:</strong> I’d like to tell all my fans … I love them! That’s it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61676\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/interview-with-progressive-edm-artist-slow-magic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61676\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/interview-with-progressive-edm-artist-slow-magic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/interview-with-progressive-edm-artist-slow-magic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/interview-with-progressive-edm-artist-slow-magic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/interview-with-progressive-edm-artist-slow-magic/","id":6977,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[6976,6975,6974],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Creature Carnival ft.

This Saturday at the Shrine Auditorium &amp; Expo Hall in L.A., world fusion and electronic music group Beats Antique will be headlining the last leg of their Creature Carnival Tour, said to include “breathtaking performances, improvisational serendipity, audience participation, and tons more surprises to come,” according to the Creature Carnival Tour website.</p>\n<p>Hosted by the Do LaB, known for putting on annual arts and musical festival Lightning in a Bottle, along with L.A.-based concert producer Goldenvoice, the Creature Carnival’s promises of a dynamic, participatory, multi-sensory presentation will likely not disappoint.</p>\n<p>Accompanying electro tribal fusion trio Beats Antique will be psytrance master Simon Posford of Shpongle, Portland-based ambient trip-hop producer Emancipator and the bass-y, dance-y beats and rhymes of Oakland-based producer and emcee Lafa Taylor. Each distinct, genre-bending act has been said to take attendees deeper into a musical journey culminating with the Carnival’s star, Beats Antique.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Comprised of frontman, producer and multi-instrument connoisseur David Satori, belly-dancing beauty Zoe Jakes and drummer Tommy Cappel, Beats Antique is infamous for delivering an otherworldly experience bringing together the futuristic beats of modern electronic music with the artistic and spiritual stylings of ancient music from the Eastern hemisphere and beyond. Frequenting festivals across the country such as Coachella, Lightning in a Bottle and Lollapalooza, dancetronica trio Beats Antique personally selected likeminded artists to perform along with them during the Creature Carnival tour.</p>\n<p>Shpongle’s strange, surreal and dreamy and ephemeral soundscapes are truly a trip, whether you’re on one or not. Known to be a pioneer in the psybient electronic music festival scene, Shpongle’s music has seen a growing fan base among not only American arts and music festival-goers but also in Europe, Israel and pockets of Asia. With musical influences spanning the globe, Shpongle’s mix of live instrumentation (i.e., flute arrangements) with electronic sonic textures makes for a perfect accompaniment to the multi-sensory stylings of Beats Antique.</p>\n<p>The Portland-based electronic producer hailing from New York, Douglas Appling, a.k.a Emancipator, has been famous among experimental electronic music fans for his soulful integrations of raw hip-hop and melodious symphonic layers for several years now. Frequently accompanied by live violin playing from Ilya Goldberg, Emancipator’s music is a mix of dope beats and ethereal melodies guaranteed to move your heart and your feet.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, Lafa Taylor is an up-and-coming hip-hop rapper, singer and producer based in Oakland with a penchant for heavy bass and gritty beats coupled with experimental electronic tunes and inspiring, activating lyrics. With his performance style featuring melodic choruses, intricate rhymes, beat-boxing and live-looping, Lafa Taylor’s performance is likely to be a dope addition to the Carnival’s night of musical wonder and mystique.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To buy tickets, go to <i>creaturecarnival.net.</i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/_SA_kvN3pVkframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_SA_kvN3pVk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58060\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58060\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/","id":7074,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[7073,7072,7071],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yang the Giant to Perform at UCSB","category":"Nexustentialism","subcategory":"Nexustentialism","publish_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  Out-of-towners crowdin’ your lawns?

According to Hertz, a friend’s invitation and the promise of “free stuff” brought him to the carnival.</p>\n<p>“It’s a fun environment,” Hertz said. “People are out here interacting where otherwise they’d be in their rooms, studying.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56821\" style=\"width: 369px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"358697386\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56823\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56821\" data-attachment-id=\"56821\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/pardall-carnival-brings-food-fun-games-and-community-gathering/christine-skari-pardall-carnival-banner/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?fit=1600%2C1010&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1010\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5200\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412905207\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christine Skari Pardall Carnival Banner\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?fit=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?fit=888%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56821\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner-1024x646.jpg?resize=359%2C226\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"359\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?resize=1024%2C646&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?resize=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56821\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Third-year microbiology and Japanese major Jonathan Tai helped tabled the Alpha Phi Omega booth during the carnival, and said that the carnival was a very positive atmosphere.</p>\n<p>“From my viewpoint the energy at the carnival was great.

President Ali Guthy and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young. The event culminated in a surprise appearance and performance by UCSB alumni and rock musicians Jack Johnson and Animal Liberation Orchestra.</p>\n<p>As the first person to speak at the event, Guthy said “Come Together” was organized in order to honor the memories of six members of “our UCSB family,” — George Chen, Katherine Cooper, James Hong, Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, David Wang and Veronika Weiss — by remembering them while moving forward with efforts to improve the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“As a new academic year has begun and we being to focus on the hopes, goals and dreams that lie ahead, we remember them,” Guthy said. “As we take those moments out of our busy day to cherish what it means to be a Gaucho and part of an extraordinary, caring family, we remember them.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, who said he still has “difficulty wrapping [his] head around making sense out of the senseless acts of violence,” of May 23, “Come Together” was formed in order to encourage students to define and determine the character and quality of the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“You students individually and collectively have the ability to make Isla Vista and UCSB the kind of community that is not only extraordinarily beautiful and fun but also safe and healthy,” Young said. “I urge you to seize this moment and begin the important but hard difficult work of reclaiming and rebuilding our community. We got this.”</p>\n<p>After Young and Guthy spoke, Johnson and ALO musically collaborated, giving students a free performance for over an hour and a half. Throughout playing songs such as “Good People,” “Better Together” and “Banana Pancakes,” Johnson and ALO members commented on their time spent in Santa Barbara and reminisced on the fond memories they associate with their former life in I.V.</p>\n<p><em>A photo essay related to this article can be found <a

href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbOPP/posts/588512774581425\">The Open People’s Party</a></strong> rescinded Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs-elect Beatrice Contreras’ party membership and requested her resignation last Friday in light of sexual assault allegations directed at her on April 23.</p>\n<p>Despite OPP’s decision, Contreras is under no obligation to step down from her position and has said she does not plan to do so. However, a petition circulating now would force a recall election if signed by ten percent of the students who voted in last month’s election for the EVPLA position — a total of 514 signatures — in accordance with Associated Students <a title=\"A.S. Election Code\" href=\"http://www.as.ucsb.edu/elections/_downloads/elections-code-2014.pdf\"><strong>Election Code</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>OPP’s statement and the petition came in response to a <a title=\"Long's blog post\" href=\"http://coalitionforsurvivorsucsb.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/dear-ucsb-community/\"><strong>blog post</strong></a> by second-year global studies major Crystal Long concerning an alleged incident of sexual assault perpetrated against her by Contreras. Contreras, who was in the midst of her campaign when Long’s blog post went public, responded in a <strong><a title=\"Google cache of Contreras' blog post\" href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pzKp3bSzrREJ:justiceintruth.wordpress.com/2014/05/02/the-truth/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">blog post</a></strong> of her own, but removed it only hours after posting.</p>\n<p>According to Contreras, a third-year sociology and Asian-American studies major, OPP’s decision to proceed with the statement without consulting her or having all party executives present invalidates their request and undermines the party’s democratic process.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote\">“Requesting the resignation of an elected official as a party is frankly ridiculous and sets a dangerous precedent,”</span> Contreras said in an email. “Party leadership said they would not take any immediate action without consulting me, and not all party executives were present when the decision was made.”</p>\n<p>However, second-year political science major and OPP Party Chair Derek Wakefield said although not everyone chose to speak, a sufficient number of party members came to a consensus to make the party’s actions legitimate.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people, not the execs essentially, had opinions and voiced them, and there were discussions and arguments on either side,” Wakefield said. “Eventually it came to the point where one person said they wanted to vote.”</p>\n<p>Wakefield said this consensus was reached because party members recognized the importance of supporting sexual assault victims.</p>\n<p>“When it’s said that way it makes it very clear that we are advocates for survivors of sexual assault,” Wakefield said. “We are staunch opponents and attempters to revise and end rape culture.”</p>\n<p>However, Long said OPP’s decision was merely a political move to protect their party reputation rather than a stance against sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I think the bigger concern with them, to be completely honest, is just to save face,” Long said. “They let go of Beatrice, so they stopped supporting her. So in the end, who do they support? It’s really just themselves.”</p>\n<p>Contreras agreed with Long’s criticism of OPP’s motives and said the statement was not issued out of respect for victims of sexual assault but to preserve the party’s standing.</p>\n<p>“They were concerned about attempts to remove me from office because it could damage me and the party’s reputation,” Contreras said in an email. “The party seems concerned with its image far more than anything else.”</p>\n<p>Contreras also said OPP’s decision was not legitimate due to the pressure that those in the majority placed on other members, and that she is being singled out only because of the public nature of the allegations made against her.</p>\n<p>“I know individual party members who don’t agree with what happened and felt coerced into voting a certain way,” Contreras said in an email. “Crystal is right that I am not the only member to be accused of sexual assault, but I am the only person being removed because of it. … I am being attacked because people are afraid to support me.”</p>\n<p><em>Peter Mounteer contributed to this article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55367\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55367\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/","id":3013,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[3012,3011,3010],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gender Discrepancy Among UCSB Employees","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":" A public report of UC employee pay data from 2012 reveals that the top 14 highest paid UCSB employees are all male, and that of the top 30 highest paid employees, only two are female.

That has been changing over the past several decades as institutions have made concerted efforts to recruit and retain female faculty.”</p>\n<p>Despite these programs, Petzold, who has been a professor in the field of mechanical engineering and computer science at UCSB for the past 17 years and is one of the top five highest paid females on campus, said even though there is no “overt bias” at the university, there exists some “hidden biases in culture” generally.</p>\n<p>“Sheryl Sandburg — she’s famous for working for the tech giant Google and now Facebook. She’s the one who says ‘Lean in,’” Petzold said. “’Lean in. Be aggressive.’ But studies say that if you’re too aggressive, you’re seen as being a ‘bitch’. So there’s this fine line you have to negotiate and … there are some subtle biases.”</p>\n<p>Petzold also said the undergraduate population of women in computer science at UCSB is 10 percent, which is typical around country. According to her, the issue is not that women are not getting accepted into these majors, but rather that females are “not even applying.”</p>\n<p>“The problem precedes the university,” Petzold said. “It occurs earlier than that. Over the course of my career, I’ve talked to various groups of women and have seen that the earliest the outreach, the better.”</p>\n<p>According to feminist studies chair and professor Eileen Boris — who specializes in labor studies and women, work, and welfare — more women are in low wage jobs than men, and women dominate the fastest growing, lowest paid jobs in the country, which includes cafeteria and clerical workers. While that is not to say men do not occupy low wage jobs, nationally there are statistically more men who are in higher paid occupations, Boris said.</p>\n<p>“A recent study just done by economist Claudia Goldin that was published this month in the American Economics Review says that the pay gap between men and women widens in the highest paid positions, like medicine and business,” Boris said. “So there’s something else happening. It isn’t just that women are in the lower paying occupations … It’s also that the structure of work is not flexible, in terms of location and in terms of hours.”</p>\n<p>Boris said the university has to bring a critical lens not only to women’s ability to become professionals in fields such as the sciences, but also in the work conditions that form these environments.</p>\n<p>“It isn’t just having women become mechanical engineers, but also looking at what is the condition of work in labs,” Boris said. “Women do pretty well in the post-doc stage, but after that there comes a gender gap because the tenure clock and the baby clock hit each other.”</p>\n<p>While professors like Boris and economists like Goldin say the solution to bridging the gender pay gap is to change work structures nationwide, men’s rights proponents such as second-year political science major Jason Garshfield said this mentality does not take into account the “male side.”</p>\n<p>“If we give scholarships to women to enter STEM fields, we should give scholarships to men to enter the humanities. If we institute maternity leave, we should also institute paternity leave,” Garshfield said. “I also believe we should get rid of the Feminist Studies program, and replace it with a program that gives a fair hearing to the perspectives of both genders.”</p>\n<p>But according to Petzold’s account of her early career in mechanical engineering and computer science, she found it particularly difficult to compete in an “aggressive” and predominantly-male environment in which “men demand more” in comparison to women.</p>\n<p>“I can say that early in my career, it was hard,” Petzhold said. “I think women grow up are being taught not to be as aggressive, to be more polite and to be helpful. All those things are innately good traits, but are not dominant traits early in careers of science and engineering … which is why it’s important we encourage women to be in these positions.”</p>\n<p>At UCSB, 33 percent of faculty are women, and of those, 86 percent are tenured, according to Yang. Among the staff, 57 percent of professional and support staff are women and 44 percent of managers and senior professionals are women.</p>\n<p>“We are continuously striving to ensure that our Academic Personnel and Human Resources processes and practices are without any gender bias,” Yang said. “Gender equity in pay is absolutely a priority that we must practice every day.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, May 2, 2014 edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55117\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/gender-discrepancy-among-ucsb-employees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55117\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/gender-discrepancy-among-ucsb-employees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/gender-discrepancy-among-ucsb-employees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/gender-discrepancy-among-ucsb-employees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/gender-discrepancy-among-ucsb-employees/","id":3469,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[3468,3467,3466],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"T-Fresh Wins First Ever Battle Of DJs Competition","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DJ-photo-3rd-Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DJ-photo-3rd-Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last night the four final winners of Associated Students Program Board’s first ever Battle of the DJs Competition faced off to reveal fourth-year communication major Tyler Fish a.k.a.

T-Fresh as the winner of a spot on the main stage at Extravaganza 2014.</p>\n<p>After eight student DJs competed in Tuesday’s eight-bracket single-elimination round, local student DJs PsychoJohn, Dropwise, T-Fresh and Beta wave received the highest scores and were slated to move on to the final round. However, a last minute disqualification of DJ duo PsychoJohn bumped DJ Angarola up to last night’s final competition at the Hub.</p>\n<p>The first round of last night’s performances featured Angarola against Beta wave and T-Fresh against Dropwise. Judged based on mixing ability, song selection, originality and energy response, DJs Angarola and T-Fresh competed in the final head-to-head round with T-Fresh emerging victorious.</p>\n<p>According to Fish, last night’s victory fulfilled his longtime wish to play at an event featuring big-time headliner acts such as rappers Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar.</p>\n<p>“I’m speechless,” Fish said. “It’s been a dream since I was a freshman to be able to play an event like Extravaganza. Now with this coming true on my senior year, it’s just an incredible feeling.”</p>\n<p>Fish said last night’s Battle of the DJs served as a stepping stone allowing him to bring his talent from Isla Vista backyards to the big stage.</p>\n<p>“The set meant so much to me. I felt like it was the best set of my life,” Fish said. “There was so much energy and I was so into it because I wanted it so bad. Words can’t explain. I’m going to start my set now.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year biochemistry major Brian Kasimov, a.k.a. Dropwise, despite all the competing DJs’ differences in style, technique and personality, Battle of the DJs allowed peers with a “common goal” to come together and share their music with the student body.</p>\n<p>“It feels really good ‘cause all three other people who played tonight are my really good friends, so no matter what a great person is going win,” Kasimov said. “We’re all here to support each other … I like that it’s a healthy competitive spirit.”</p>\n<p>Third-year microbiology major and event-attendee Brett Russell criticized the judge’s choices, claiming Angarola generally had a greater “variety of beat,” even as he played a “solid six minutes of straight Disclosure with pop songs mixed on top.”</p>\n<p>“Angarola made me gig in ways I haven’t experimented with before, and with T-fresh, I really felt the need to sarcastically dance by simply standing in place and pumping my arms up and down,” Russell said. “Although T-fresh’s Space Jam mix was by far the best song I heard of the whole night … in general, during his set, I felt like I was in 2010.”</p>\n<p>However, according to A.S. Program Board publicity coordinator and third-year communication and film &amp; media studies major Karen Masumoto, T-Fresh rightfully won first place by bringing “great energy” to the event, showcasing his widely-liked, well-versed talent. Masumoto said the event went swimmingly and has prompted Program Board to continue doing an annual Battle of the DJs from now on.</p>\n<p>“T-Fresh was awesome! He really got the crowd going,” Masumoto said. “It’s cool to see everyone in the music scene come together to support each other.”</p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-54120-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-3rd-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1491%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54121\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (3rd) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-4th-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1504%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54122\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (4th) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-1st-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1501%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54123\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (1st) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-2nd-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1501%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54124\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (2nd) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p>Photos by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Local student DJs were judged by a checklist system based on mixing ability, song selection, originality, energy and audience response. The four DJs with the highest scores — Beta wave, PsychoJohn, T-Fresh and Dropwise — will move on to the next round at tonight’s final competition at the Hub.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Program Board publicity coordinator Karen Masumoto, third-year communication and film &amp; media studies major, Battle of the DJs is a new incarnation of the annual Program Board event Battle of the Bands, which also aims to spotlight local student talent.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to do something new,” Masumoto said. “We always have transitions during Extravaganza when there’s no music playing, so we thought that during that time we could really use DJs. And we kind of wanted to spotlight all the DJs in Isla Vista since there’s so many house parties that have talented DJs.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major and Speak Volumes editor-in-chief Dylan Chase — who is one member of DJ duo PsychoJohn — said the event allowed electronic music artists across “a whole gradient” to display their different brands of talent, utilizing different techniques ranging from controllers to vinyl to CDs to live mixing.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to show that DJing is a craft and that there are varying levels,” Chase said. “We try to incorporate different stuff into our routine. We do live performance and play vinyl records.”</p>\n<p>Describing their music as a “dreamy and ephemeral kind of house vibe” that ranges from “soul and funk music,” Chase and his DJ partner — third-year film &amp; media studies major Alex Ho — have already played shows at I.V. Theatre, Indochine and SoHo in addition to last night’s performance at the Hub. According to Chase, he and Ho “like to play that funky shit.”</p>\n<p>Tyler Fish, a fourth-year communication major who goes by the DJ name T-Fresh, described his music as “bouncy and highly energetic” and he said the roots of his DJ career go back to his freshman year during Deltopia, which he described as “pretty fucking legendary.”</p>\n<p>“I was a drummer all my life and I was in numerous bands … then I realized that bands aren’t playing backyards on DP — it’s DJs,” Fish said. “So I picked up my first pair of turn tables, sold my drum set and got some speakers.”</p>\n<p>Chemistry graduate student Matthew Snedaker, a.k.a. DJanet Napolitano, said his influences are rooted in hip hop and that his DJ name is derived from his views on the UC President.</p>\n<p>“I really like Janet Napolitano as a person. I think it’s really important to have a woman in this position,” Snedacker said, “But you have to also consider that she’s a politician and she’s making an absurd amount of money when she should be a public servant, and that bothers me a lot.”</p>\n<p>Third-year film &amp; media studies and sociology double major Ashkan Karimloo — whose DJ name is Kuro—said Battle of the DJs has allowed upcoming talent in the newly emerging electronic music scene to distinguish and legitimize their craft.</p>\n<p>“With DJs, there’s usually this kind of stigma that they just stand there and press play,” Karimloo said. “This is cool because it shows what people can actually do, and it’s good to just to get word out that there’s this different variety of talent and music being played.”</p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-54077-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Front-page-DJ-photo_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=2090%2C1362\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54082\",\"title\":\"Front page DJ photo_Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/bottom-right-DJ-Photo_Angela-Kempf-Luu.jpg?fit=4163%2C2439\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54081\",\"title\":\"bottom right DJ Photo_Angela Kempf-Luu\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Bottom-left-DJ-photo_Angela-Kempf-Luu.jpg?fit=700%2C652\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54080\",\"title\":\"Bottom left DJ photo_Angela Kempf-Luu\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Upper-right-DJ-photo_Angela-Kempf-Luu.jpg?fit=902%2C900\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54079\",\"title\":\"Upper right DJ photo_Angela Kempf-Luu\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Upper-left-DJ-photo_Kenneth.jpg?fit=700%2C652\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54078\",\"title\":\"Upper left DJ photo_Kenneth\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p>Photos by Kenneth Song &amp;

The meeting was organized by administrators in the Division of Student Affairs and Associated Students officials, and 35 students — including representatives such as the Interfraternity Council President and A.S. president — will participate. The meeting will be closed off to other students.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, students marched from the Student Resource Building to the Faculty Lounge, demanding a public forum with the newly appointed UC president, who was the Secretary of Homeland Security before becoming the new leader of the UC system.</p>\n<p>Napolitano’s appointment, which came in July, has largely received backlash from many students since she is the first UC president to lack a background in education, previously acting as the governor as well as attorney general of Arizona. She has also drawn much criticism from the undocumented immigrant student community since she spearheaded the controversial Secure Communities program during her time as Secretary of Homeland Security. The deportation program seeks out undocumented immigrants using fingerprints by provided the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to the site for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and deported around two million undocumented immigrants — including non-criminal persons — during Napolitano’s term.</p>\n<p>At yesterday’s protest, student held up a giant banner highlighting the “No” in “Napolitano,” students from UCSB’s I.D.E.A.S. — or Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success — as well as other campus organizations, marched past UC Police Department officers and CSOs until finally arriving to the Faculty Lounge, where they were met by Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead. After criticizing Napolitano on her implementation of record-breaking deportation programs as former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, students asked Yang and Armistead if there could be a public forum allowing more students to speak than the few “student leaders” selected by administrators.</p>\n<p>I.D.E.A.S. member and second-year student Abigail Salazar said many undocumented students on campus have been directly affected by Napolitano’s deportation programs, herself included.</p>\n<p>“With all due respect, this is a person who has invaded my home, who has destroyed my family and I wasn’t even invited [to the meeting],” Salazar said. “I want to direct a lot of feelings that I have towards her. I have that right.”</p>\n<p>Salazar also said administration’s decision to hold a private meeting instead of a public forum with Napolitano further insulted the undocumented student community.</p>\n<p>“I command you, Chancellor Yang, to hold a public forum,” Salazar said. “We’re not going anywhere … we will not stand by this any longer. Do you understand us? With all respect, do you understand us?”</p>\n<p>In response to student demands, Armistead said Napolitano would leave right after tomorrow morning’s private meeting and that there was thus “not enough time for a public forum.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure that everybody who was picked is happy to have an open forum,” Armistead said. “They actually want to have a dialogue, and the concern is — that this happens within the public forum, then nothing can happen and you can’t have a conversation.”</p>\n<p>Attendees of tomorrow’s meeting include A.S. executive officials, leaders of campus organizations such as Human Rights Board, I.D.E.A.S. and S.C.O.R.E., or Student Commission on Racial Equality, as well as members of Greek life. However, some of the students invited are not currently the head of any campus group, according to Mario Vasquez, a member of Human Rights Board.</p>\n<p>Chicano Studies professor Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, who joined students in protesting today, said he has taught many students who have dealt with deportation on a personal level. He said student demonstrations should push Napolitano to support the undocumented student community and advocate for immigration policy reform.</p>\n<p>“She could apologize for what she did, and she could put pressure on the Obama administration to stop what it’s doing,” Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval said. “It’s nearly deported two million people, which is more people combined than any other in U.S. history.”</p>\n<p>Napolitano has also expressed support for the DREAM Act and undocumented students, and she recently devoted $5 million in UC funding to financial aid and special counseling for undocumented UC students, according to a UC Office of the President press release.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Norma Orozco expressed opposition to the appointment of Napolitano both because of her experience in the Department of Homeland Security and her lack of professional academic experience.</p>\n<p>“This is the president of our university. This is the person that is supposed to make the most critical decisions for universities, such as where our funding goes and where our funding comes from,” Orozco said. “She was in charge of increasing the budgets for our military … that’s not what a university’s about.”</p>\n<p>According to Armbruster-Sandoval, Napolitano should respond to student protest and demand for a public forum if she wants to save face as the rightful president of the UC.</p>\n<p>“So the idea is to say, ‘Hey we’re not happy with this, listen to us,’” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “Apologize, do something, show some contrition, show that you’re a human being, that you have some heart, basically, because you’ve broken our hearts.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"500598246\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"53199\"><img data-attachment-id=\"53201\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/protesters-express-outrage-over-napolitanos-exclusive-meeting-with-ucsb-student-leaders/napolitano-protest-johnclow_11-21-2013-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1385052985\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"19\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Napolitano Protest JohnClow_11.21.2013-04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-53201\" alt=\"Napolitano Protest JohnClow_11.21.2013-04\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by John Clow / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Kennedy, a second-year political science major, who served as an On-campus Senator until his resignation in January, is an independent candidate.</p>\n<p>Foronda said she aims to use her student body government experience to engage and empower students if elected.</p>\n<p>“I have been involved with Associated Students since my first year,” Foronda said. “I am here today not only to run as AS president, but to represent you as a student body and the student voices that have otherwise been silenced.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he would continue to make real changes on campus as A.S. President in addition to the reforms he has already implemented as RHA President.</p>\n<p>“I love UCSB. Since the first day I stepped on this campus I fell in love with this campus,” Abboud said. “I have implemented real changes on this campus … [like] take out boxes in the dining commons. The Office of the President will allow me to implement even more direct change to this campus”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said substantive reform is necessary to make the association more fiscally efficiently and criticized A.S.’s excessive spending of student’s money on honoraria — particularly on salaries for Executive candidates.</p>\n<p>“I’m running because I’m passionate about making this campus a better place for all students,” Kennedy said. “There needs to be several structural reforms in A.S. Currently, tens of thousands of dollars aren’t going back to the students, and are being pocketed by A.S. executives.”</p>\n<p>Foronda focused on the rising cost of tuition as the chief monetary concern for students, and said it is crucial to encourage students to participate in rallies, lobby legislators and generally voice concerns about the issue.</p>\n<p>“Tuition has risen over 300 percent in the last 10 years,” Foronda said. “Student voices have not been heard … I will be there, and I have been there … representing student voices.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, his goal is to continue keeping students constantly involved in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We can’t get caught up in the jargon,” Abboud said. “As RHA president, and as A.S. senator … I’ve done a really good job connecting with students. A.S. was created for and by the students and we have the right to keep A.S. … related to the students.”</p>\n<p>Addressing the subject of student apathy, Kennedy said the fault lies not with the general student population, but with their student government representatives who have failed to successfully engage them.</p>\n<p>“Disconnect is a huge problem between A.S. and the student body,” Kennedy said. “Students have not been engaged at all whatsoever in A.S. …where is the outreach? Where is the engagement? … I hope that in the future as I have done to continue the work in engaging students … making sure students are aware that they have agency, that they have power.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1172887416\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50825\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50819\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/calpirg-protests-obamas-potential-student-loan-interest-rate-hike/debate_filephoto/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPod touch\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1365682595\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"3.3\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Debate_FilePhoto\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50819\" alt=\"Debate_FilePhoto\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>DAILY NEXUS FILE PHOTO</h6>\n<h6>On Wednesday night, A.S.

Students can then use these lists to find contact information for books they need.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Sophia Armen said the student-run textbook marketplace is a kickoff for what the A.S. Office of the President hopes will eventually become an institutionalized series of regular student-run buy-back events at the beginning of each quarter.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a process, but still, it’s something we’re going to start now,” Armen said. “Buying books is expensive, and we have no control over return for books. There’s pressure with costs everywhere, so this way students can make profits instead of having to go through a middleman or to the university.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board are also engineering a student-run textbook website structured similarly to the textbook advertising hosted on many Facebook group pages.</p>\n<p>“We’re tying to make a mechanism that is like Facebook, but student-run,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>UCen Bookstore employee and third-year biopsychology major Debbie Gee said the marketplace threatens to redirect students and revenue away from the campus’s main textbook retailer.</p>\n<p>“It might detract from the amount of traffic in the UCen,” Gee said. “When people buy textbooks they also buy other things, like pens, pencils and notebooks. So if they buy from somewhere else, sales in general could potentially go down, too.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the book buy-back will allow students to bypass bookstores and exchange reading material in a much more efficient manner.</p>\n<p>“The problem is, when we consistently go to the university or small companies, books can get expensive because you don’t have other options,” Armen said. “This came out of student organization. We’re creating innovative ideas when the university is putting a burden on our backs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Elizabeth Dang said the traditional process of buying and reselling schoolbooks is time-consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>“When I sought out the buying back process, I would find that buyback prices would be for only 20 percent of the book, which is practically nothing,” Dang said. “And textbook costs are ridiculous — especially since we only use it nine weeks, and in most of my classes we only read two chapters out of like 500 pages.”</p>\n<p>While the bookstore does offer the option to rent books for a cheaper price, Gee said a successful student-run textbook marketplace could end up being a worthy competitor to the university.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure how the prices at this thing will compare to bookstore prices, but lots of students are struggling with finances, and this could detract from sales if it ends up being cheap, efficient and well-run,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>According to Armen, Associated Students Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board hope the textbook marketplace fuels widespread questioning and analysis regarding the causes of high textbook prices and promotes further student organization to address shared financial issues.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we’re here: inspiring students, making [them a] part of the solution on campus and showing the impact of having things student-run,” Armen said. “We are a community sharing resources.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of January 9th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49734\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49734\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/","id":3103,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[3102,3101,3100],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/158"}},"__N_SSG":true}
