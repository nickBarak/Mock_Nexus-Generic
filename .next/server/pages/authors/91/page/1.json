class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students work at a table inside the McNair scholars room. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>President Donald Trump’s education budget released on May 23 calls for a $9.2 billion rollback in spending for several educational programs. Among them, the McNair Scholars Program may face the steepest cut.</p>\n<p>The McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement is a federal scholarship offered to first-generation, low-income students or those who belong to underrepresented minorities in the United States. By pushing these students toward doctoral degrees, the program hopes to diversify faculty in universities across the country.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara began the McNair program in 2007, and it has since guided over 50 students to masters and Ph.D. programs. Though UCSB houses a smaller department than other universities, current and former McNair scholars say their education would have been impossible without it.</p>\n<p>Jamelia Harris, a first-year doctoral student at UC Los Angeles, graduated from UCSB last year with the university’s highest honors — the Thomas More Storke Award. She began her first year at UCSB as a biochemistry major, but she said the McNair program guided her to understand the impact of research as a social scientist.</p>\n<p>“Ph.D.s are nonexistent in my network of family members and friends,” Harris said. Growing up in a predominantly black, low-resource community in Lancaster, Calif., she said she was always “tracked” into higher level courses.</p>\n<p>Her experiences, and those of her family, led her to pursue research in segregated education within the same community. She now focuses on black female’s vulnerability to policing and discrimination in schooling.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78222\" style=\"width: 688px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"670327053\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78283\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78222\" data-attachment-id=\"78222\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/mcnair-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?fit=1356%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1356,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McNair 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?fit=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78222 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3-678x1024.jpg?resize=678%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"678\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?resize=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1160&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?w=1356&amp;ssl=1 1356w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78222\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volumes of research from McNair scholars are arranged on a bookshelf. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have not met a student of color across all six schools [I was admitted to] who was admitted directly from undergrad without the support of McNair,” she said. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that speaks volumes to the level of support that McNair offers for many of us who are first-generation college students.”</span></p>\n<p>Though McNair has guided several students from their second undergraduate year to a Ph.D., the White House believes its progress is inefficient. In an off-camera briefing on May 22, the Office of Management and Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, said the McNair program had not accomplished its objectives.</p>\n<p>“The last time the Department of Education looked at this, it was 6 percent effective — 6 percent,” Mulvaney said.  “I can’t do that anymore.  We can’t do that anymore.  We cannot defend programs like that — 6 percent just doesn’t cut it.”</p>\n<p>Beth Schneider, UCSB McNair program chair, said Mulvaney’s statement lacks context. When she read the proposal, she said, “I was shocked — but not surprised.”</p>\n<p>Approximately 1 percent of undergraduates graduating in 2005 earned their doctorate by 2015, according to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In comparison, Schneider said, a 6 percent doctorate rate for McNair scholars is a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Still, the U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.) report says “McNair is a high cost per-participant program that serves relatively few students.” There is limited evidence of effectiveness for both of these programs,” the<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget18/summary/18summary.pdf\"> report</a> reads.</p>\n<p>Schneider acknowledged that this is true — the McNair program serves a niche group of students at a high cost — but explained that it is essential to prompt students toward a graduate education if they are to return to UCSB as a diverse group of educators.</p>\n<p>Syrian Truong, a transfer student who plans to apply to graduate school next year, began the McNair program after moving to Santa Barbara from Fresno. Truong is gay, a first-generation student and a multiracial Asian-Latino American. For people who don’t experience educational barriers as a part of their daily life, he said, the value of structural support is difficult to explain.</p>\n<p>“There’s a certain amount of condescension as you start moving higher and higher up … you look around and you start seeing less and less of people that look like you,” he said. “For me, that was never a problem before, but it starts to get grating.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78223\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1357638069\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78283\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78223\" data-attachment-id=\"78223\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/mcnair-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1357&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1357\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McNair 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=888%2C589&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78223 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1-1024x679.jpg?resize=888%2C589\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78223\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos of McNair scholars and faculty advisors line the walls of the McNair program trailer next the Veteran Resource Center at UCSB. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The concept of graduate school appealed to Truong as a first-year at UCSB, but he said it would have been “a much harder road” without the McNair program. He now does research in theoretical physics, specifically through condensed matter theory and statistical mechanics, and is looking toward a Ph.D.</p>\n<p>“If that support was given to other students …  maybe it doesn’t bring the next Einstein,” he said. “But it could bring a lot of good change, inventions and a lot of progress in the world.”</p>\n<p>The D.O.E. currently allows McNair scholars 10 years to complete their Ph.D. Each university records and submits its own data, but according to McNair supporters, the D.O.E. has not consolidated this data properly. As a result, the D.O.E. report used possibly outdated information spanning from 1989 to 2000.</p>\n<p>Schneider said the D.O.E.<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/highered/mcnair/mcnair.pdf\"> study</a> does not match trends at UCSB, where each cohort since 2007 has either surpassed the 6 percent doctorate rate or is well on its way to meeting this percentage.</p>\n<p>Last year, Harris and several other students spoke to UC President Janet Napolitano to push for a more proportionate number of faculty to match the amount of black Californians.</p>\n<p>“If we have the president of an entire University of California admittedly saying that these programs are necessary for the improving the retention and recruitments of faculty of colors,  I personally don’t see why our actions aren’t embodying those sentiments,” she said.</p>\n<p>After the federal budget was proposed last week, Napolitano spoke out against the proposed cuts. Though she focused on rollbacks to the National Science Foundation and energy science programs, she said the proposed cuts could affect more than 133,000 UC students.</p>\n<p>“As president of the nation’s largest public research university, I urge Congress to immediately begin work on a revised budget proposal that makes meaningful investments to help our students, protect our patients and keep America’s research enterprise preeminent,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/","id":2380,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2379,2378,2377],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Parker J.

He loved “Star Wars” and was just starting to get into “Star Trek,” beginning with the T.V. show. “He wasn’t a big fan of the movies,” Rand said, describing Parker as a “purist” when it came to pop culture.</p>\n<p>“He was an old rocker at heart; he was a huge Beatles fan,” Rand said. The White Album was likely Parker’s favorite, and his dad said Parker once went out of his way to find the album for his younger sister.

He was always looking out for others,” Rand said. “The caring person that he was, he always championed people that were left to the side and the people who fell behind.”</p>\n<p>A group of nearly 20 people from Adventure Programs held a memorial for Parker Monday at Campus Point, gathering next to a rental office where Williams worked and spent much of his time on campus.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77034\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1081213815\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77182\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77034\" data-attachment-id=\"77034\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/dustin-harris-daily-nexus-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77034\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A group of students from Adventure Programs gather around a fire at Campus Point to remember Parker J. Williams on Monday, April 17. <em>Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Huddled close to each other around a small fire, the circle took in the sound of crashing waves, wrote messages to Parker and chose to either toss in the notes or share their memories aloud.</p>\n<p>Several members of the group worked closely with Parker after he completed his Leadership Training Course last year and remembered him as diligent, careful person who had an “eagerness to do well for others.”</p>\n<p>“The world was better with him in it,” one friend said, adding that Parker had “a magical presence that made you feel comfortable.” Another recounted her shifts working the rental office with Parker, saying he made her a better employee and a better person.</p>\n<p>Rand shared with the Nexus a speech Parker presented at his Eagle Court of Honor ceremony. It is printed it here in its entirety:</p>\n<p><em>“Scouting for me was never about the Eagle. I’ve always been more enamored by the journey…Nothing can take from me the majesty of watching a sunset from the top of Big Bear Mountain, the calm of napping near a gentle creek in Whitsett forest, the rush of adrenaline from fighting white water in the Kern River Valley…Whenever I need a reprieve from life’s sad noise or dull hum, all I need to do is remember the beauty and vivacity of nature, and suddenly, I have the motivation to push on so that I may explore more of these unique paradises…what has made my time here (Scouting) truly enjoyable has been the time spent with friends.</em></p>\n<p><em>I’ll never remember the hundreds of conversations that were had, but I will remember the smiling and laughing, simply being content. An indicator of this is that no matter where we go camping, the heart of the trip always seems to be at night when we all gather around a campfire, a lamp lit table, or all cram inside one tent to play cards while laughing away the troubles we left at home. It is an innumerable amount of amazing memories…and each one I will look fondly upon for the rest of my life.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"738092682\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77182\"><img data-attachment-id=\"77201\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/announcement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?fit=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1152\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Announcement\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77201 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

She formed a tight circle of friends while she was at UCSB, infecting acquaintances with her positivity and open mindedness.</p>\n<p>“She was always smiling,” Rod Gomez, a fourth-year environmental science major who met Lim when they were second-year students, said.</p>\n<p>While juggling a full course load in the engineering department, Lim managed a job at Curvature, paid her own bills and was always open to adventure. At Curvature, coworkers were impressed by her work ethic, and Lim had plans to continue working in Santa Barbara after graduating in June.</p>\n<p>Lim loved melodic dubstep beats and electronic dance music, especially the producer Seven Lions. She tried her hand at DJing for fun, friends said, and she was an avid supporter of her friend’s musical pursuits.</p>\n<p>Raghav Thirumulu, Lim’s housemate and close friend, said she had an impressive talent for video games, beating her friends at games she had just picked up. She also entertained an obsession with several television shows, including “Westworld,” “Black Mirror” and “The Walking Dead.”</p>\n<p>“She just gave off this energy that made your day so much easier,” Ming Guo, who also lived with Lim, said.</p>\n<p>Evelyn Choi met Lim during her first year, and soon considered her a best friend and a sister. The first night they met in Anacapa Residence Hall, the two fell asleep while talking and studying in the lounge. A custodial worker woke them up several hours later, and “From then on, I knew she was going to be someone really important in my life,” Choi said.</p>\n<p>Over four years, Choi became accustomed to Lim’s quirks — including her keen interest in World War II. Lim had posters of “Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific” throughout her room, and she considered the era one of the rawest moments in human emotion.</p>\n<p>Lim was also given a few goofy nicknames: “Chrispitos,” named after crispy taquitos, and “Christinith,” referencing the movie “The Other Guys.”</p>\n<p>Landon Peik, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major, met Lim for the first time at Hard Summer music festival. He remembers Choi leaning on Lim’s shoulder for the duration of a set by Porter Robinson, enjoying her friends’ company with their favorite music.</p>\n<p>College was a transformational time for Lim, her friends said, and she was always happy to go on hiking trips, to music festivals and spend time with people. She made her friends feel comfortable, while always challenging them with new ideas.</p>\n<p>Armando Muñoz, one of Lim’s housemates, described her as “one of the guys.”</p>\n<p>“You could talk to her about anything, at any time,” he said. “She was always down to listen and give advice. She could take it and dish it better than most guys.”</p>\n<p>Lim was extremely humble about her intelligence through years of hard work, friends said, and she never complained, even on her first 13-mile hike through the Sequoia Woods.</p>\n<p>Chris Tuch, a UCSB alumnus, met Lim as a resident assistant in Anacapa Residence Hall. The two were close, often staying up for hours watching Netflix shows, talking and playing Nintendo 64 games.<br>\n“She was a homie,” he said.</p>\n<p>The group of friends this week received an outpouring of support from neighbors, friends and students who crossed paths with Lim. Thirumulu created a donation page Monday in her honor which quickly exceeded the target goal of $5,000, raising over $8,139 in two days.</p>\n<p>Friends will hold a memorial in Lim’s honor this weekend, playing her favorite music to celebrate her life. Anyone who is interested in attending can contact Thirumulu at<em> rrthirumulu@gmail.com</em>. Lim’s family will also arrange a funeral ceremony later this month.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75595\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75595\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/","id":2433,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2432,2431,2430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Muslim Students Push Back Against Immigration Ban","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Muslim-Ban-by-Megan-Mineiro-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Muslim-Ban-by-Megan-Mineiro-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"An executive order barring travel from six countries prompted over 200 people to protest at UC Santa Barbara Monday, echoing voices that spoke out nationally against the new presidency.

90 days. </span></p>\n<p>As reports of detainees began to surface at airports throughout the country, Naia Al-Anbar, a Muslim woman and third-year anthropology student, began organizing a protest

Arabia.</p>\n<p>“I was just furious,” Al-Anbar said when she was reading the executive order. “When you push someone to the very edge … you want to be a part of a group that is just as outraged as you are.”</p>\n<p>Working with Queers Against Fascism, the Muslim Student Association and the Student Activist Network, she put together the protest in two days.</p>\n<p>Rallying the crowd at the

Associated Students and UCSB administration released a statement Monday saying they would prioritize assistance for any students affected by federal agencies, and the UC released a similar <a

for alcohol violations, according to SBSO, and then noticed what appeared to be an active narcotics deal on a balcony, with one subject allegedly snorting a white powder off his hand and another suspected to be holding a bag of drugs.</span></p>\n<p>Suspects began resisting when deputies and officers attempted to detain them. The suspects also assaulted the police officers, SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover said, and one officer sustained minor injuries that did not require medical attention.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One officer discharged a taser on a suspect before placing him in handcuffs and ankle restraints. An SBSO press release described some of the suspects as “extremely combative.”</span></p>\n<p>A total of three suspects were arrested after the incident. One was arrested for possession of cocaine, felony resisting arrest and assault on a peace officer. Another was arrested for assault on a peace officer, resisting arrest and possession of narcotics for sales.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last was arrested for resisting or delaying a peace officer while the first two suspects were being arrested. Due to an ongoing investigation, police have not released names of the suspects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who attended the party were leaning over a side barrier to observe the scene when police were arresting the suspects. Many were intoxicated and police told them to leave the house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A press release said people threw glass bottles in the area near law enforcement personnel and yelled obscenities.

Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The bluff was a communal backyard for the nine units on 6653 Del Playa Drive, known as The Oasis housing.</p>\n<p>After emergency personnel <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-22/balcony-collapses-on-6653-del-playa-drive/\" target=\"_blank\">responded to the sudden collapse</a> Sunday, a Santa Barbara County building inspector determined that Units 1, 4, 5 and 9 would be evacuated to preserve the residents’ safety.</p>\n<p>Though the foundation of the building was unharmed, the four ocean-facing units were evacuated in preparation for emergency demolition — the first of many steps to scale back the Del Playa property before future cliff erosion.</p>\n<p>James Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals, purchased the building from Ed St. George in 1992. It was built in the early ‘70s and is among 38 buildings leased by the rental group.</p>\n<p>“None of my other properties are in any danger at all,” Gelb told the <em>Nexus</em>. “This was a total fluke.”</p>\n<p>The bluff collapsed on the day of a heavy storm, and though there was no damage to the actual residence, Del Playa Rentals returned the evacuated residents’ security deposits, last month’s rent and partial January rent.</p>\n<p>Residents were initially given until Friday to find new housing, but Gelb told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday that the county Building &amp; Safety Department red-tagged the units for Thursday, giving students one less day to relocate.</p>\n<p>No one was injured in the bluff collapse, but “if anyone was going to be hurt on that patio, it would have been me,” Gelb said, adding that he conducts very frequent inspections of all of his housing units.</p>\n<p>Currently, Gelb has filed an emergency demolition permit for the evacuated units. Santa Barbara County will approve the permit, and Gelb said County Building &amp; Safety Manager Massoud Abolhoda intends to expedite the process.</p>\n<p>The Building &amp; Safety Department is responsible for approving the permit within 30 days, and Gelb said he will continue to cut back his properties to account for future deterioration of the I.V. cliffside.</p>\n<p>The entire Del Playa bluff is vulnerable to erosion, Abolhoda said, and the county conducts inspections of the rock face after every major storm.</p>\n<p>The last building inspection was in August, and though the county knows the “setback of every building” in Isla Vista, Abolhoda said events like Sunday’s emergency could not be predicted.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing you can do to avoid it,” he said, adding that there are inherent risks to living on cliffs in I.V. The county could not determine exactly how much of the Del Playa backyard fell into the ocean, but it is estimated to be more than five feet.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75253\" style=\"width: 686px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1883960290\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75245\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75253\" data-attachment-id=\"75253\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/2017-01-23_stephenmanga_6653dp-6-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?fit=676%2C784&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"676,784\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?fit=216%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?fit=676%2C784&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75253\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?resize=676%2C784\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"784\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?w=676&amp;ssl=1 676w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?resize=216%2C250&amp;ssl=1 216w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Exposed rounded concrete cement poles in a house adjacent to the balcony collapse reveal the extent of cliffside erosion on Del Playa Dr. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Del-Play-Bluff-Policy-Revised-February-2016-2-1.docx\" target=\"_blank\">county figures</a>, the rate of I.V.’s bluff erosion is “a source of debate,” but the bluff is retreating on average six inches a year. In extreme conditions like a storm, a cliffside can crumble by as much as a foot.</p>\n<p>If California building codes were applied in I.V., the foundation of a home would have to be at least 40 feet away from a descending slope. The county says in its documents, however, that “several geotechnical and geological studies” in I.V. have determined that a building only needs to be 15 feet from the cliff.</p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of a landowner to determine that a building’s foundation makes a home “safe and habitable,” according to county codes. The foundation of the building was unaffected by the bluff collapse, Gelb said, adding that resident allegations saying the foundation had cracks in recent months were unfounded.</p>\n<p>In the past year, Gelb said he has cut back 15 of his residences to prevent damage and injury from future cliff erosion. “I’ve done everything proactively,” he said, adding that other landlords in I.V. have also begun replacing oceanside units further back from the cliff.</p>\n<p>Students who were evacuated from 6653 Del Playa Drive will be forced to find alternate housing by Thursday, and others are still shaken from what they described as the sounds of a “massive earthquake” on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Several former residents who were contacted by the <em>Nexus</em> throughout the week were unable to respond, saying they were in the process of moving furniture, belongings and signing leases for new housing.</p>\n<p>UCSB is offering housing in Tropicana Student Living for up to two groups of seven students, and the off-campus apartment complex also has room for individual students.  The University will not be covering the housing costs, but the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships may be able to provide emergency grants or loans.</p>\n<p>“It seems that both the university and Tropicana each have enough space to accommodate all of the displaced students, so there should be no difficulty for any of these students in quickly finding alternative places to live,” Andrea Estrada, UCSB’s spokesperson, said.</p>\n<p>Several former Del Playa residents are searching for non-university housing in I.V., and the street-facing units are still occupied.</p>\n<p>According to Abolhoda, the street-facing units are “as safe as any other building anywhere else,” barring an emergency situation like an earthquake.</p>\n<p>The former residents will be safe entering their homes to retrieve their belongings, Abolhoda said, but residents at Unit 9 will not be able to enter the home due to a staircase that was compromised after the bluff collapse.</p>\n<p>Robin Unander, lawyer for the I.V. Tenant’s Union (IVTU), said the “situation is still evolving” daily with information from Del Playa Rentals. Unander said it is too early to determine if there is any legal ground for a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>“There is not a lot of other compensation that they would be entitled to at this point, and we need to see where all of the dust settles,” she said.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Senate also discussed a resolution in support of the displaced residents, asking that IVTU provide up to $300 per student for moving costs and ensure that the students have legal representation.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75245\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75245\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/","id":4464,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4463,4462,4461],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Report Possible Sexual Assault in Isla Vista Fraternity House","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2017-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A possible sexual assault occurred Saturday night at an unknown fraternity in Isla Vista, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department reported Sunday.\r\n\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A possible sexual assault occurred Saturday night at an unknown fraternity in Isla Vista, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department reported Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a university crime alert, police received a report at approximately 11:15 p.m. that a female victim had been sexually assaulted in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim told police that she recalled the location of the assault as a fraternity, but did not know the address.

Senate passed a resolution on Wednesday to preserve El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room, which is used by several different cultural organizations on campus. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate passed a resolution to preserve the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room Wednesday following concerns that the historic building would be demolished in 45 days.</p>\n<p>The 40-year-old building is located behind the UCSB Library and is used as a gathering space for several cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>Senators Lesly Silva and Jesse Velasquez authored the resolution and presented it at Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting. The resolution supports student groups <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/students-told-to-evacuate-el-centro-annex-before-possible-demolition/\" target=\"_blank\">who have pushed to preserve the building</a>, asking that it be recognized as a cultural artifact.</p>\n<p>“El Centro Arnulfo Casillas is an open space that can be used and is used by many groups from every race, religion, gender identity, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, status, and creed,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Campus building official Ed Schmittgen sent a notice to campus architect Marc Fisher on Jan. 9 saying that consultants found the trailer’s integrity was compromised following inspection.</p>\n<p>The report lists insect infestation and dry rot on the building’s floor, rust and corrosion on supporting steel beams and lack of adequate ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor. It concludes that the building’s problems create an unsafe condition in case of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>The building was categorized as a “severe” life risk per the UC Seismic Policy, Schmittgen said, and advised that the building be either improved or demolished in 45 days’ time. Administrators suggested that although the trailer would be difficult to preserve due to its 10-year lifespan, the building’s artwork could be relocated.</p>\n<p>Over 50 students gathered in the El Centro annex the following Friday to negotiate other options with campus administration. Among those in attendance were Schmittgen, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Vice Chancellor of Campus Design and Facilities Marc Fisher.</p>\n<p>Students listed several concerns, saying the 45-day evacuation timeline was restrictive, administrators had not maintained the building properly and the University could not remove students’ home-away-from-home.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB received distinction and grant money as a Hispanic Serving Institution in 2016, the A.S. resolution states “the Hispanic and Latinx community has seen little to no return on this money that their communities have been promised.”</p>\n<p>“It is clearly stated that ‘We, the UCSB Associated Students 67th Senate, represent and advocate for the undergraduate student body and strive to effectively address their concerns,’ and there is a clear argument that a large group of students who depend on this space want the 67th Senate to act upon their concerns and support them,” the resolution adds.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the A.S. Senate passed the resolution without objection.</p>\n<p>“At this point this has been an ongoing battle for about 45 years,” Senator Silva said. “The whole goal is to finally end this and make it a permanent space that isn’t being constantly threatened.”</p>\n<p>Students will gather in the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room for another meeting with administration on Friday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

students filled the UC Santa Barbara campus on Election Day 2016 in protest of president-elect Donald Trump. As the echoes of protests die down throughout the country, students are once again bristling in anticipation of a new presidency that may cause irreparable change throughout the country.</p>\n<p>Undocumented students have fallen into the center of this struggle, pinpointed by Trump’s unfavorable rhetoric regarding undocumented immigrants and President Obama’s 2012 initiative, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).</p>\n<p>The California government, the University of California and university law enforcement now attempt to provide answers in the eight days until inauguration.</p>\n<p>In late 2016, UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang signed a statement endorsed by the Association of American Universities in support of DACA. Chancellors from all 10 UC campuses, including UC President Janet Napolitano, also signed the statement.</p>\n<p>Napolitano, a trained lawyer, was the former United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2013. She was criticized at the beginning of her term for implementing the controversial Secure Communities program, an immigration-enforcement policy that detected undocumented immigrants via fingerprints taken by local police.</p>\n<p>In the last three years, however, she has supported the UC’s D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program for undocumented students, allocated $2.5 million per year for created undocumented student fellowships and granted UC’s Undocumented Legal Services Center $900,000 per year under the Undocumented Student Services Program.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of questions with the incoming Trump administration, what it means for universities and what it means for students,” Napolitano said on Jan. 6, speaking to a group of UC journalists. “We don’t have answers to those questions, nobody knows the answers.”</p>\n<p>To combat the unknown, the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) released a set of principles in December listing the boundaries of university police and medical services. “We are very clear that we are not turning university police into surrogate immigration agents, and we’re not gonna be voluntarily turning over student records,” she said.</p>\n<p>When asked about retaliation from the federal government if the UC does not comply with the new presidency, Napolitano said the UC was not in immediate threat.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of talk, particularly in the Republican party right now, about cutting funding in a lot of areas,” she said. “They haven’t singled out campuses, nor have they singled out campuses that have stated their values as we have.”</p>\n<p>Others, though a small minority, support Trump’s ideas and believe undocumented students do not have a place on UC campuses.</p>\n<p>A student who wished to stay anonymous, fearing retaliation, has begun organizing efforts to report undocumented students who attend UC Santa Barbara. He said the group is in a “planning and monitoring phase only” prior to Trump’s inauguration, hoping for a “likely scenario” that the future president will repeal DACA.</p>\n<p>“If Trump lets us down, then it is possible that this will lead nowhere,” he said. “We have a large and growing number of students on board and we have notified the university of our plans, but for the time being, we are all waiting until January 20th.”</p>\n<p>The group is not affiliated with any campus organization, according to the student, and its goal is ensure that UCSB abides by United States immigration laws.</p>\n<p>“I cannot reveal our tactics yet,” the student said. “All I can say for now, is that we consider ourselves to be an honest and patriotic team of whistleblowers when it comes to the potentially illegal activity happening at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Students who have been vocal about reporting undocumented immigrants on the UCSB campus have received threats on social media, and the student who spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> said he had heard violent, threatening rumors and been called a “fascist and a Nazi.”</p>\n<p>In response to a question regarding students who hope to join similar groups at other UC’s, Napolitano said Jan. 6 that it would be more prudent to focus on reporting criminal activity, rather than young people who travel to the U.S. to gain an education.</p>\n<p>Students are currently in the final planning stages of a large walkout to take place on inauguration day Jan. 20, with the Student Activist Network hosting several meetings to create posters and make maps of a march route.</p>\n<p>Administrators and faculty from UCSB have created an ad-hoc committee to discuss undocumented students’ safety while on campus. Among several ideas, campus administrators hope to distribute “know your rights” pamphlets, create faculty sanctuary homes for students and reinforce mental health services for students who feel threatened.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 15, Santa Barbara Police Chief Lori Luhnow said that the SBPD was committed to protecting individual rights, reassuring concerned residents.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to arrest and seek prosecution of anyone who has committed a crime in Santa Barbara, but the immigration status alone of individuals in Santa Barbara is NOT a matter for police action,” she said in a statement.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting two weeks ago to oppose the College Republicans event.</p>\n<p>Professors suggested creating a list of “sanctuary” faculty members who are available to support students who are distressed. The idea is modeled after the “sanctuary campus,” a symbolic designation with special powers.</p>\n<p>Sanctuary campuses can protect students from deportation, certain federal immigration laws and other threats, similar to sanctuary cities. The movement has emerged at Tufts, Rutgers, Yale, Stanford and several other universities after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, followed by multiple protests throughout the country.</p>\n<p>At an A.S. Senate meeting Tuesday, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez presented an alternative for students who didn’t wish to contribute to the College Republicans event.</p>\n<p>The Compulsory Fee Refund Application allows students to withdraw their portion of student funding from specific programs and is a product of a 1993 California Supreme Court Decision: Smith v. Regents.</p>\n<p>The court ruled in 1993 that the UC cannot force students to pay for events that pursue political or ideological goals through “compulsion and coercion.”</p>\n<p>“This specific ruling was obviously brought up at this specific meeting because one of the administrators who has a lot of ties with a lot of these left-leaning organizations,” Andrew Gates, College Republicans president, told the Nexus during the Senate meeting Wednesday, adding that the ruling could work against “left-leaning” events.</p>\n<p>“We have, what, one event per quarter? But if you divide 5,000 by 23,000 students … compare that with the countless left-leaning events that you know all the conservative students could, like, get a refund for,” he said.</p>\n<p>At the faculty meeting one hour prior, Sanchez quoted comments from the College Republican’s YouTube video of the Nov. 3 Senate meeting. The comments can only be removed by the owner of the account, or YouTube if the comments are reported.</p>\n<p>“Lets get these cunts. Comment a link to the BLM fascists facebook page, I’ll trigger these scumbags,” one comment reads.</p>\n<p>“Dis what fatherless iq 85 african americans been taught by iq 130 jews who think whites nazist. ethnic weapons,” read another comment on a repost of the video, which College Republicans cannot regulate. Ladijah Corder, co-chair of UCSB Black Student Union, later recited the same comment to the Senate during public forum.</p>\n<p>Tamara Afifi, professor of communication, said while advocacy may interrupt scholarly work, it is the responsibility of non-minorities to support activists. “It’s up to us,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of white people are scared to say something stupid; they’re scared to be vulnerable,” she said. “It’s not up to people of color to educate them, they have enough placed on them.”</p>\n<p>Armistead, who has been a vocal advocate of students who are against the College Republicans program, said “We need to take our campus back.”</p>\n<p>“I’m upset, too,” Armistead said. “It kills me because I’m the one who ultimately has to make this event successful.”</p>\n<p>Other faculty members built a suggestion list, including attending the event en masse to occupy seats and arguing with Ben Shapiro point by point during his lecture.</p>\n<p>Demetrius Ous, a UCSB graduate student, suggested planning counter events at the same time of the College Republicans events.</p>\n<p>“The point of these events is expressing joy and love for one another,” he said. “If you see hatred, you should show it a smile because hatred is going on.”</p>\n<p>The conversation culminated with an initial push to create buttons for faculty to wear during the event. The buttons would be emblems of inclusivity, saying “UCSB Against Hate.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily
