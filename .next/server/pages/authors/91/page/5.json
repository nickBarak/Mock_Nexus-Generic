The letter also states the Santa Barbara area also lacks tier-one health insurance options, which would provide generic medications instead of specialty and brand name medication.</p>\n<p>President of the Faculty Association Nelson Lichtenstein said there are several issues with the UC Care plan as it applies to university faculty. According to Lichtenstein, one main problem was that Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital is not included in the UC Insurance Plan, and there is an extra cost to faculty who get care provided to them by the hospital.</p>\n<p>“The UC Care health system is a set-up that is clearly not working. The most important hospital, the only one, is not part of that system,” Lichtenstein said. “We have staff that need to use the facility that can’t use it without it costing them more money.”</p>\n<p>According to the letter, the transition to UC Care eliminated the university faculty’s access to Anthem/Blue Cross provided coverage, which the letter states poses numerous problems in the quality of faculty care.</p>\n<p>“This transition has generated difficulties at all campuses, but at Santa Barbara the elimination of Anthem/Blue Cross and the introduction of UC Care as a replacement have resulted in a series of inequities related to level of care, the cost of care, and the availability and continuity of care,” the letter states.</p>\n<p>The letter also states that while the Sansum Clinic, another regional healthcare provider for Santa Barbara, is included in UC Care as a tier-one option, the coverage it provides is “incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Sansum Clinic has signed on to UC Care, but only on a year by year basis. Santa Barbara Select HMO, an association of independent physicians serving our community, is not part of the UC Care tier one network,” the letter states. “Meanwhile, other UC campuses without medical centers, notably Santa Cruz and Riverside, have been able to convince officials in the Office of the President to negotiate with and secure UC Care tier-one coverage by local providers and hospitals in their communities.”</p>\n<p>The letter additionally cites issues presented by signing up with Sansum, including long wait times for an initial appointment with a doctor, existing limits on the capacity of Sansum to provide access to faculty and the extra costs incurred by getting care at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital as a tier-two provider.</p>\n<p>Lichtenstein said that without the Cottage Hospital, patients are forced to go to Los Angeles for the next closest hospital.</p>\n<p>“It’s the only quality hospital in the area before LA and for faculty suffering chronic illnesses, 30 percent of the faculty is above 60, they would be consigned to go to UCLA, which is not practical,” Lichtenstein said.</p>\n<p>According to Lichtenstein, other UC Campuses are also having problems with the implementation of the new insurance policies at other campuses.</p>\n<p>“Other campuses aren’t particularly happy either, Santa Cruz is one of them,” Lichtenstein said. “Turns out UC Health care hospitals aren’t designed to treat everyday illnesses, they’re for research and they’re good at it … even UCLA has problems with their rates going way up. We’re particularly pissed because our rates went up too but we aren’t getting access to the best hospital between L.A and San Francisco. UCOP should have thought about that before they made it system-wide.”</p>\n<p>Faculty members such as professor of geography Ray Smith posed suggestions to solve the UC Health program’s lack of coverage.</p>\n<p>“Going back to trying to do something independent, they could send a delegation to UCLA and see if they could send a satellite hospital to UCSB,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Faculty Advisor to the Chancellor’s Office Richard Watts said UC Care may eventually close down on its own.</p>\n<p>“Come 2016 we could be on the edge of having UC Care so expensive it will run out of business anyhow,” Watts said.</p>\n<p>During the discussion, questions were raised regarding the effectiveness of the letter to Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Several attendees said a possible first step would be to meet with Yang in a group setting to openly discuss the issues.</p>\n<p>Professor of Physics Harry N. Nelson said the problem with the letter to Yang is that it did not produce responses.</p>\n<p>“Given that there was a major problem last year, I’m kind of surprised they never want to come back and see what happened,” Nelson said. “If they actively don’t want to check back, tactically it’s unimaginable that they don’t care enough to see if their solution worked.”</p>\n<p>The town hall ended with a general consensus to meet with Yang for further discussion of premiums and quality of care and begin taking action by the end of the open enrollment period for this year, toward changes in the upcoming year.</p>\n<p>According to Lichtenstein, further action needs to be taken soon.</p>\n<p>“I think the takeaway from this meeting is we weren’t just making accusations, we chose Kum-Kum [Bhavnani] to delegate a committee to explore our options,” Lichtenstein said. “Whether that is legal action or anything else, we need to begin to negotiate right now with UCOP so we can start to make decisions.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Ray Smith as an entomology professor.

Finance and Business Committee discussed the Students of Color Conference, funding for various campus organizations including the A.S. Food Bank and the Mock Trial team and also placed a freeze on the account used by the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E) over alleged lack of clear information on where the group’s funding is being used.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez spoke on behalf of A.S. President Ali Guthy on the upcoming Students of Color Conference event held by S.C.O.R.E. After discussion, the meeting passed a motion to freeze S.C.O.R.E’s finance account, which will be sent to the Senate on Wednesday for ratification.</p>\n<p>According to Chief Financial Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus, S.C.O.R.E has been vague regarding their use of funds.</p>\n<p>“There had been a clear misunderstanding of everything they’ve been doing,” Theus said, “They are not being transparent with us as Board.”</p>\n<p>According to Márquez, A.S. did not receive adequate information on the planning and selection processes of the upcoming Student of Color Conference, to be held this weekend at UC Merced, to no fault of the organization.</p>\n<p>“We need to know more information about the Student of Color Conference in the planning as well as the selection process,” Márquez said. “We want to know what has been the process been so far in selecting who the delegates will be to the conference and how they were chosen. They were not aware of this responsibility of giving us this information and as they hadn’t necessarily done this function on behalf of A.S. before, I believe their responses were genuine.”</p>\n<p>According to S.C.O.R.E. diversity educator and second-year biology major Kyron Covington and outreach coordinator Allison Bettencourt, the group needed funds for additional applicants because current funds had already been used.</p>\n<p>“We had to reopen the application process to accommodate an increase in applications,” Covington said. “The funds had already been processed.”</p>\n<p>In addition, mental health awareness organization Active Minds, a campus group dedicated to mental health awareness, requested $1,162.50 to fund Stigma Free UCSB, a public forum event where student organizations can discuss issues and struggles with mental health and the lack of safe spaces. The group said the event is aimed towards addressing lack of representation of mental health groups on campus.</p>\n<p>The Muslim Student Association (MSA) also requested funds from the A.S. Finance and Business Committee. Student representative for MSA Altamash Azam said the group’s first event, a barbeque on Goleta Beach, requires $377.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be an open public forum anyone who has a question for the average Muslim student, open to general public,” Azam said. “We’re anticipating about 40 people and we’re contacting other religious groups on campus to accomplish one of our long-term goals of communication amongst the groups.”</p>\n<p>According to Captains of Mock Trial, Andrew Cavarno and Brett Russell and Vice President, Cheryl Wilson, their upcoming Yale Invitational conference is a rare occasion, and requires funds to transport the team to and from the airport once it arrives in Connecticut.</p>\n<p>“In the history of our program we have never been able to compete in this national tournament,” Russell said. “We have begun to establish ourselves as national powerhouse after last year and we have received invitations to these East Coast tournaments. We would greatly benefit from this.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[Correction: This article and the accompanying headline incorrectly referred to the AS Finance and Budget Committee as the the AS Finance Board. That is incorrect. The article has been updated accordingly.]</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously incorrectly stated Kyron Covington’s position as S.C.O.R.E. “co-chair”, and incorrectly stated Allison Bettencourt’s position as “club historian”.

Lectures</h4>\n<p>Michael Lewis, acclaimed author of <em>Moneyball, The Blind Side</em> and <em>Flash Boys,</em> came to the Granada Theatre Tuesday night to speak about his experience as a financial journalist, storyteller and self-proclaimed sloth.</p>\n<p>Hosted by Arts &amp; Lectures, NPR business reporter Sonari Glinton moderated the evening, beginning with an interview portion and allowing time at the end for an audience question and answer session.</p>\n<p>Lewis said he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Art History and went on to the London School of Economics to graduate with a degree in Economics.</p>\n<p>“I was very, very lucky in that before I entered University, my father told me to find and study what I loved,” Lewis said. “In exchange he would give me a three-year buffer after I left school in which he would pay for my living expenses and education.”</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, the offer from his father was instrumental for his career.</p>\n<p>“It was during this time that I discovered I wanted to be a writer, and shortly after that I discovered I had to do something to make up for my Art History degree,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Lewis included anecdotes from his childhood in Louisiana, describing the environment of New Orleans by quoting the family motto his father once told him.</p>\n<p>“Do as little as possible, for it is better to receive a slight reprimand than perform an arduous task,” Lewis said. “A very large part of my life is dedicated to avoiding unpleasant chores.”</p>\n<p>Lewis went on to discuss the process that is involved in finding a story and putting it on paper and how the story of <em>The Blind Side</em> came to be, beginning with how he discovered it.</p>\n<p>“I went to visit a friend of mine from high school in Memphis one year,” Lewis said. “When I got to his house, there was a six-foot-tall, 350-pound black kid sitting in the living room of a white Republican Evangelical Christian in the most segregated city in America … and no one said anything about it.”</p>\n<p>Lewis continued to describe how the story progressed over the year and how he came to terms with writing a story that eventually turned into a movie about his best friend’s family, as well as his experience working as a writer in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“It was great! Movie people are great, they fear the writer,” Lewis said. “They would solicit my opinion and then completely ignore what I said, they just wanted to make sure I would stay nice. But both ‘Moneyball’ and ‘Blindside’ turned out to be truly good films.”</p>\n<p>Lewis also said it is a highly impersonal process to have a personal work turned into a Hollywood hit.</p>\n<p>“The stupidity in Hollywood is not at the level of actors, writers and directors,” Lewis said. “There’s some truly beautiful storytelling that happens there. The stupidity in Hollywood lies in the business decisions.”</p>\n<p>Lewis concluded the discussion by answering audience questions and touching on what it means to be a good writer.</p>\n<p>“People who are really good storytellers tend to have very distinctive voices on the page, people are afraid of their individuality and once they start mimicking their favorite writers, their value is gone,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, his future plans include writing a book about U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>“He has really let me into his life like no other journalist, and if I’m able to write this book the way I want, six months after the end of his presidency people will want nothing more than to read a book about Obama,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Glinton said she enjoyed meeting Lewis, whom he admires for his rare talent.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of those weird things when you’re meeting someone who you’ve known and followed and then you meet them and realize you don’t have to be scared about it,” Glinton said. “He’s a natural storyteller, and genuine, real, accomplished storytellers are few and far between. He’s one of the masters right now.”</p>\n<p>Glinton also said he thought Lewis’ advice would be of practical use to students.</p>\n<p>“Something he said to the student about doing what you like really stuck with me also, it’s ridiculous to tell someone to follow their dreams,” Glinton said. “But students should really be in pursuit of what they like to do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major and Arts &amp; Lectures student manager for the event Lauren Cassis agreed and said she enjoyed his discussion about his books and his time as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>“I thought he was very insightful and I liked how his conversation was very broad in the topics,” Cassis said. “Hearing about ‘The Blind Side,’ how the story came together, was very interesting.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An

“Meet Your Neighbors Day” was held throughout I.V. this past Saturday and drew hundreds of students and community members to various parks in the area.</p>\n<p>The event began with activities in nine neighborhood parks, featured free food from local businesses and provided attendees with information about safety and community-building in I.V. Attendees from each park then gathered at Anisq’Oyo’ Park around 4 p.m. for a gathering that showcased local bands and a DJ and allowed festival attendees to present flags representing their specific areas of I.V.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Parks District festival organizer Paola De La Cruz said the event was not exclusive to students and extended its reach to all I.V. residents.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“People have been brought together by seeing the community come together,” De La Cruz said. “There’s been a mix of family and students.”</p>\n<p>Monte-Angel Richardson, an I.V.
