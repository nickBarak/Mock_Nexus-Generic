By his second year, she said Werner was a “top part of the team.”</p>\n<p>Along with other members of the team, Cohen and Werner would frequently drive up to Mammoth Mountain for skiing and snowboarding excursions. These trips created memories to last a lifetime, Cohen said, and made their friendship of two years feel like much longer.</p>\n<p>“For me, the favorite parts were the car rides up to Mammoth,” she said. “Just being in that car, and freestyle rapping up the 395, the entire way … it wouldn’t matter how late we got to Mammoth.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said Werner’s friends came together in Isla Vista after his passing to heal and celebrate his life, finding closure by remembering his influence upon their lives.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing that Hayden taught me was to have gratitude and to really recognize all the beauty that surrounds you in life,” Cohen said. “It’s not like I’m moving on, I’m moving forward. I will always have a piece of Hayden with me.”</p>\n<p>Werner was also a lifeguard in Orange County and an avid surfer, according to an email sent on Tuesday by Katya Armistead, the dean of student life.</p>\n<p>The Orange County lifeguards have arranged a sunset paddle-out at 6:30 p.m. on May 30 at Dana Strand Beach in Dana Point.</p>\n<p>A memorial service will be held for Hayden on May 31, at 11 a.m. at the Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano in San Juan Capistrano.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Students who are in need of mental health support can contact Counseling and Psychological Services

eight of its residence halls.</p>\n<p>Over 98 percent of current freshmen live in residence halls, and the university hopes to make more housing available for all students as part of an <a href=\"http://ucop.edu/student-housing-initiative/\">initiative</a> authored by the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) in January.</p>\n<p>This year, all continuing students were able to apply for residency in Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and San Nicholas halls, which have traditionally housed freshman students. The five residence halls, along with Manzanita Village and Santa Catalina Hall will be increasing the amount of triple rooms for the next academic year.</p>\n<p>According to the UCSB residence hall contract for the upcoming academic year, Santa Catalina Hall will convert the highest number of rooms, beginning fall 2016 with 975 students living in triples. Santa Catalina Hall currently has 157 triple spaces, according to Mario Muñoz, associate director of Resident Placement &amp; Assignment Services.</p>\n<p>During a UC Regents meeting on Tuesday, chief financial officer Nathan Brostrom presented strategies to expedite the development of student housing, mentioning UCSB’s increased triples as an example of a campus-specific housing solution.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s enrollment has decreased after hitting its peak in 2014, students in an undergraduate population of 20,607 still struggle to find housing on campus and in Isla Vista. According to the report, over 500 students are on UCSB’s housing waitlist, with almost 15,000 students on waitlists UC-wide.</p>\n<p>UCOP’s housing initiative aims to introduce 14,000 new beds across all UC campuses by 2020 and approximately 3,800 spaces have been created since January.</p>\n<p>“The UC has housed over 34,000 students in the past year,” Bergstrom said, “Given the size and scope of this initiative, there is no one-size-fits-all model.”</p>\n<p>Nivi Lakshminarayanan, incoming first-year pre-psychology and brain sciences major, selected her first choices for housing as Santa Cruz and Anacapa Hall.</p>\n<p>“I think it’ll definitely be different, since right now I just live in my own room at my house,” she said. “I always imagined living in a double whenever I thought of college so this is definitely a change.”</p>\n<p>Many freshmen, such as Thomas Crimmel, incoming first-year geography major, select their housing based on affordability.</p>\n<p>“I was originally considering a double, but the extra 2,000 dollars a year that came along with that double definitely encouraged me to seek out a third roommate.”</p>\n<p>Housing contracts for continuing students were due in early February, and Housing &amp; Residential Services will begin deciding spaces for students who have enrolled after the freshman contract deadline on May 15.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/","id":2497,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2496,2495,2494],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S., Students Address Bribery Allegations Made Against IFC","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students filled A.S.

Senators during public comment Wednesday.<em> Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After the Associated Students Elections Board called for a “re-vote” of the entire Spring Election ballot on Tuesday, pointing to alleged bribery by the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), a packed room of students at Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting presented contrasting opinions.</p>\n<p>In an “unsolicited letter” from the IFC president, the board said it found information that the IFC gave “monetary incentives” to students who voted in the Spring Elections by awarding philanthropy grants to chapters that received high voter turnout. The board released a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Letter-to-Student-Body.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> regarding the allegations on Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>Brendan Gonzalez, IFC president, submitted a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/statement-from-inter-fraternity-council-president-regarding-allegations-of-bribery-in-a-s-elections/\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday in which he said that the IFC consulted with the Office of Student Life prior to developing the grant program. In the letter, Gonzalez said, “The IFC has been unequivocally transparent about these grants,” and said he received information from administration that “many other UCSB campus organizations have used similar programs.”</p>\n<p>“We made this clear … this grant was not based on who you vote for,” Gonzalez said on Wednesday evening. “I encourage people to look at both sides.”</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday’s Senate meeting, the Elections Board is still recommending that all executive and Senate positions, fee initiatives, fee reaffirmations, constitutional amendments and Campus Elections Committee initiatives once again go through the voting process, potentially modifying the results of last week’s election.</p>\n<p>According to Kimia Hashemian, A.S. internal vice president and fourth-year sociology major, the senate does not currently have the power to call for a “re-vote.” If they choose to pass such an amendment, the senate would have to draft a new policy within a week to create guidelines for future use.</p>\n<p>“I personally don’t see that the constitution has been broken. It does say in the constitution that all students have the right to vote in the election,” Hashemian said. “There is no precedent to this, and there’s no policy at all; in a sense it could be argued that it comes down to whatever the senate decides.”</p>\n<p>However, Hashemian said students could separately present the issue to A.S. Judicial Affairs and the A.S. Elections Committee. If a student petition were to be created, Hashemian said the Elections Board would have “full jurisdiction” in taking further action.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70463\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70463\" data-attachment-id=\"70463\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-s-students-address-bribery-allegations-made-against-ifc/brendan-gonzalez-speaks-to-as-senate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1345&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1345\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brendan Gonzalez speaks to AS Senate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C597&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70463\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1-1024x689.jpg?resize=750%2C504\" alt=\"Inter-Fraternity Council president and UCSB second-year student Brendan Gonzalez listens to questions asked by AS off-campus senator Akshaya Natarajan during public comment during the AS Senate meeting at the Corwin Pavilion on Wednesday, April 27, 2016.

Elections Board believes the alleged bribery “skewed the results” of the A.S. elections and demonstrated that “members of the IFC decided that certain votes meant more than others.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB consists of over 900 organizations, and not every organization has access to such funding to offer incentives to their members,” the board’s initial document states. “IFC’s actions posed a threat to the conduct of fair elections and if no action is taken in regards to this situation, it would be perpetuating the belief that votes can be bought and sold.”</p>\n<p><em>University News Editor Maura Fox contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70476\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-s-students-address-bribery-allegations-made-against-ifc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70476\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-s-students-address-bribery-allegations-made-against-ifc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-s-students-address-bribery-allegations-made-against-ifc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-s-students-address-bribery-allegations-made-against-ifc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-s-students-address-bribery-allegations-made-against-ifc/","id":2626,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2625,2624,2623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

criticized the University of California in an Assembly oversight hearing Wednesday, with one lawmaker saying he was “pissed” when he saw the state auditor’s claim that the UC had relaxed its standards in admitting nonresident students.</p>\n<p>The state auditor published a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AUDIT.pdf\" rel=\"\">report</a> in March that found the UC “has undermined its commitment to resident students” by admitting more nonresidents. According to the study, the university enrolled 82 percent more nonresidents from 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 while decreasing enrollment for resident students by about one percent in that same period.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the audit claims that the UC lowered its standards for nonresidents by admitting thousands of out-of-state students with lower grade-point averages, S.A.T. and A.C.T. scores than those of resident students.</p>\n<p>Assembly members called the hearing to examine if the University’s admissions and finance policies disadvantaged California residents applying to the UC in recent years. According to committee chair and District 52 Assemblymember Freddie Rodriguez, the UC’s policies have failed to put Californians first.</p>\n<p>“Sadly, we are here today with an audit report that confirms what many of us have speculated,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>District 64 Assemblymember Mike Gipson, who requested the audit in 2015, said he was “pissed” by the state auditor’s findings that the UC displaced resident students by increasing the number of non-resident students.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a slap in the face, not only of the members of the legislature, but also of the taxpayers of the state of California,” Gipson said. “The University has just done a very poor job.”</p>\n<p>UC Associate Vice President of Undergraduate Admissions Stephen Handel insisted, however, that the report is “incomplete” and that the University admits every eligible resident student.</p>\n<p>“The University makes an explicit guarantee to every family in California whose son or daughter applies to UC that we will find a place for them if they meet UC’s eligibility requirements,” Handel said. “It is a guarantee that we never extend to nonresidents.”</p>\n<p>UCSB <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/campus.profiles.2015.16.pdf\" rel=\"\">enrolled</a> 6,014 students in 2015, of those, 86 percent were California residents, seven percent were out-of-state and seven percent were international.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_yhhis0kzk8JIuVxN\" title=\"UCSB Nonresident Enrollment Gradually Increased from 2013 to 2015.\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?xTC\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am/yhhis0kzk8JIuVxN\" target=\"_blank\">UCSB Nonresident Enrollment Gradually Increased from 2013 to 2015.</a><br>\n <a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create pie charts</a></div>\n<p>The state audit report specifies UCSB among four other campuses that increased its nonresident target faster than the resident target. Nearly 20 percent of UCSB’s expenditures are funded by the state, and the freshman enrollment targets for the 2015-2016 year aimed for approximately 3,850 California students and 550 nonresidents.</p>\n<p>The different enrollment targets were created to fill each state-funded seat with a California student, according to Lisa Przekop, UCSB Director of Admissions.<br>\n “Non-residents never replace a seat funded by the state,” Przekop said in an email.</p>\n<p>The report also includes GPA breakdowns between resident and nonresident students for every school in the UC. UCSB displayed lower average GPAs for nonresident students between 2010-2011 and 2014-2015.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_Q08MW6ql9XhDCnQ3\" title=\"UCSB showed significant shifts in admitted resident and nonresident GPAs between 2009-10 and 2010-11.\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?cIO\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am/Q08MW6ql9XhDCnQ3\" target=\"_blank\">UCSB showed significant shifts in admitted resident and nonresident GPAs between 2009-10 and 2010-11.</a><br>\n<a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/bar-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=bar_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create bar charts</a></div>\n<p>According to Przekop, the “slight” differences in GPA can be attributed to inconsistencies in the ways different schools calculate GPAs across the world.<br>\nIn the Assembly hearing Wednesday, Handel said the GPA, S.A.T. and A.C.T. scores of the students admitted to the University do not completely qualify an eligible student.</p>\n<p>“Reader evaluations are based on a set of 14 academic factors that look well beyond traditional numeric markers of achievement,” Handel said. “A grade-point average and a test score, important as they are, provide only partial insight into the qualifications of students for college.”</p>\n<p>UC Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom further asserted that the state budget is what controls the enrollment of resident students, not the enrollment of nonresidents.</p>\n<p>“Growth in nonresident students does not constrain the Univeristy’s ability to enroll growing numbers of California resident students,” Brostrom said. “The key to enrollment is state funding.”</p>\n<p>District 16 Assemblymember Catharine Baker told the UC representatives at the meeting that they need to stop discounting the audit report as “unfounded” and start working with the legislators on a solution.</p>\n<p>“It’s very easy for all of us to come after you with pitchforks, and trust me, I’ve got one and constituents of mine have one,” Baker said. “Part of the solution is that you are not tone deaf.

Segev completed the surgery in early March, transplanting a liver and kidney from a deceased HIV-positive donor to two HIV-positive recipients. Although the procedure posed the risk of transplanting a different HIV strain, the surgery was successful for both patients.</p>\n<p>President Barack Obama signed the H.O.P.E. Act into law in November 2013, allowing the use of organs from HIV-positive donors for transplantations and laboratory studies. The initial ban was enacted in the 1980s as a solution to a climate of fear surrounding HIV/A.I.D.S., research has since found HIV-positive donations to be safe for transplant.</p>\n<p>CJ Young, representative from Lois Capps’s office, said Capps is “extremely excited” about the successful surgeries and that research resulting from the H.O.P.E. Act has removed the stigmas surrounding HIV-positive donors.</p>\n<p>“Eliminating the stigma around HIV is critically important; that stigma can be a barrier to gaining access to treatment,” Young said. LGBTQ communities were “drastically impacted” by the stigmatization of HIV donors, Young said, and former school nurse Capps used the legislation to help amend the problem.</p>\n<p>During a press conference on Wednesday, Dr. Christine Durand of Johns Hopkins said both transplant patients, who wished to have their identities kept private, are doing “extremely well.” The kidney patient has returned home, and the liver patient is expected to be discharged in a few days.</p>\n<p>“The patient would have remained on the waitlist for years,” said Dr. Durand, describing donor conditions prior to the H.O.P.E. Act.</p>\n<p>The use of HIV-positive organ donors can potentially add 300 to 500 donors to the current waitlists, serving nearly 1,000 recipients, said Dr. Segev. The success of the surgery combined with the legislation in the H.O.P.E. Act promises future life-saving transplants for HIV-positive patients and those with end-stage organ diseases.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69216\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69216\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/","id":3899,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3898,3897,3896],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Billionaire Donates $200M To Fix ‘Gross’ Dorms","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=501%2C370&ssl=1","description":"Billionaire Charles Munger donated a record-breaking $200 million to UCSB on Thursday, designating the funds for a state-of-the-art on campus residence hall.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Billionaire Charles Munger donated a record-breaking $200 million to UCSB on Thursday, designating the funds for a state-of-the-art on campus residence hall.</p>\n<p>Munger’s donation will be used as a seed fund for two development projects at UCSB, utilizing 28 acres of land where the Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and San Nicolas dorms currently exist.

Among other bill items, Senate passed an honoraria cap which ensures that general appointed officials shall not receive honoraria higher than $200 per quarter, chairs or vice chairs shall not receive higher that $350 and senators shall not receive higher than $400.

In the demand for a special Senate meeting, signees claimed that senate violated the A.S. 2015-16 Legal Code in passing the bill, because BCU chairs affected by the process were not directly contacted. According to the legal code, A.S. can legally amend honoraria policies every Winter Quarter of an even year after having “written or oral consultation with all parties involved.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68981\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68981\" data-attachment-id=\"68981\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/students-clash-over-honoraria-charges/senate-march-9_by-lorenzo-basilio-16/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate March 9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68981\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Senate-March-9_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-16.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68981\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that you all think this is a communicative process boggles my mind,” Akshaya Natarajan, signee of the demand, off-campus senator and second-year political science and Asian-American studies double major, said.

One of the suspects was allegedly armed with a souvenir baseball bat, according to the Santa Barbara Sherrif’s Office (SBSO). During the course of the robbery, one male victim sustained a black eye and another male victim broke his hand. Within the same night, SBSO identified a female driver of the getaway vehicle as first-year student Breanna Kromer, 18, and she was taken into police custody after a traffic stop on Embarcadero Del Mar. Kromer was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of robbery, resisting arrest and conspiracy. Public Information Officer for SBSO Kelly Hoover said one of the suspects was familiar with a resident at the location, and the incident “wasn’t a random crime.”</p>\n<p>Garcia was arrested the next day and booked into the jail on charges of first degree robbery and criminal conspiracy.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 31, SBSO arrested White and the 17-year-old male after receiving an anonymous tip about their location at a residence on the 900 block of Camino Lindo. SBSO, along with I.V. Foot Patrol, attempted to contact the suspects, but the suspects refused to comply. UCPD officers set up a perimeter and contained the area. After entering the residence with the K-9 Unit, the officers were able to arrest and book White and the 17-year-old for robbery, conspiracy and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p>White is still in police custody and is being held on $100,000 bail, according to SBSO. The juvenile was released with pending charges.</p>\n<p>Garcia is currently on a conditional own recognizance release (OR). Benjamin T. Ladinig, chief prosecutor for the case, said the court released Garcia on OR due to the recommendation of the Santa Barbara County Jail conditional own recognizance release/bail release (OR/BR) unit.</p>\n<p>According to the OR/BR report by the Santa Barbara County Superior Court, SBSO arresting officer said Garcia “made threats against the victim during jail phone calls.” Prior to Garcia’s release, alleged victims one and two provided similar input, with victim two saying he feared Garcia may return to the residence to retaliate.</p>\n<p>As references in the report, Garcia’s parents described her as “a good kid, trustworthy and very responsible,” adding they were unaware of Garcia having any issues involving alcohol or drugs. The references also expressed certainty that Garcia would appear in court and abide by conditions of release.</p>\n<p>Kromer’s bail was posted at $100,000, but Judge Clifford Anderson reduced it to $50,000 after the pretrial. Kromer posted bail and was released. Kromer was denied an own recognizance release “due to lack of reference input and unverified personal information,” according to the OR/BR report.</p>\n<p>Kromer’s father said in the report that she had “control” issues with alcohol and she “periodically uses marijuana.” Kromer’s mother cited past alcohol and drug use, not including current usage, and said the subject is in need of counseling. Kromer’s mother described her as “dependable, loyal and responsible” but said she is not currently taking her medication and is “headed down a bad path.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Santa Barbara Independent</em> <a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2016/feb/08/three-arrested-alleged-iv-baseball-bat-robbery/\">reported</a> that in court Monday, public defense attorney Mark Owens claimed Kromer received no medications during her time in jail. In response, Hoover said “there are several procedures in place when an inmate is booked at the jail and at no time was there ever any indication that there was medication that was prescribed to her. The first time the jail knew of this issue was during court.”</p>\n<p>The University was unable to provide a comment regarding the academic status of the students after the incident.</p>\n<p>Hoover said there is a possibility that drug involvement is a factor in the motivation for the robbery, but the case is under investigation.</p>\n<p>The preliminary hearing for Garcia, Kromer and White will be held Feb. 24 at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>*This article has been updated from its original form to protect the privacy of a subject of this article</em><em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/","id":3759,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3758,3757,3756],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students, Senate Discuss Free Speech Issues","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Alex-Nagase-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Alex-Nagase-1-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students (A.S.)

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room to accept the resignation of two senators, discuss internal matters and host public forum, which included several students calling for First Amendment reform at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Jason Garshfield, fourth-year political science major, introduced the issue saying, “This right of free expression is under threat at UCSB.” Garshfield presented an article from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (F.I.R.E.) which gave UCSB at a “red light” rating regarding freedom of speech and expression at the University. According to F.I.R.E., a red light university has at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, UCSB’s recent implementation of a “Bias Response Team” poses a threat to students by limiting speech which is labeled as offensive.</p>\n<p>Garshfield proposed drafting a resolution in support of free speech to respond to F.I.R.E.’s rating and improve student freedoms.</p>\n<p>“Free speech is not a point of pride right now. It is a point of shame, and we should all be ashamed at how our university has completely ignored the perfectly legitimate concerns of a perfectly legitimate civil rights organization,” Garshfield said. “Making bigotry something that cannot be expressed does not make it go away… it makes it a black market good.”</p>\n<p>During the question portion of Garshfield’s presentation, Senator Jerel Constantino addressed the senate asking whether Garshfield was a member of the “White Student Union” Facebook group. Garshfield responded to the point saying, “I’m a Jew, but it’s good to know that suddenly I’m a white supremacist.”</p>\n<p>Brandon Morse, fourth-year political science major, said the election code of the student senate also contends with true freedom of speech. Morse described the current university policy as “a regulatory framework that violates the constitution.”</p>\n<p>“The freedom to speak is clear, it’s not up to interpretation. With that being said, the definition of what’s racist is up to interpretation as well,” Morse said. “I’ve been told that as a straight, white male I can not experience racism, but that does not mean on an individual level, you cannot be disparaged.”</p>\n<p>Morse urged the senate to consider Garshfield’s resolution.</p>\n<p>“I may not agree with anything or everything that one of you says but I will certainly fight to the death to protect your right to do so,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>In response to Morse, Senator Akshaya Natarajan suggested the current university policy exists to aid marginalized groups who may be educationally restricted by microaggressions and offensive speech.</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus Derek Dimpfl said limiting speech is, in fact, extremely harmful to student growth and education.</p>\n<p>“I fear that our culture has forgotten, or chosen to forget in whole, or in part, how fortunate it is to have such protections … for what they protect us from is much more frightening than that which they expose us to,” Dimpfl said.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Nawar Nemeh and College of Letters and Science Senator Stevan Abdalmalik both submitted their resignation letters to A.S. Senate earlier this week and presented brief parting messages after public forum.</p>\n<p>“Being at this table, you have an extreme amount of power. I don’t know how many of you know it, but you have the power to alleviate the struggles of human beings. That is an amazing power.” Nemeh said. “I please ask you to weigh every single vote before you make it, to weigh it seriously in your heads as to how it will affect every student on this campus and every community out there.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he was leaving due to personal reasons.</p>\n<p>“I’m resigning, mostly for personal reasons. I thought I owed you all I guess an explanation as to that I want to refocus on my academics, I want to refocus on research that I’ve been doing,” Nemeh said. “I have an internship that I have been neglecting at the U.S. State Department that I need to be putting more time and effort in and I really do want to look more after my family.”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik did not disclose the reason of his resignation, but also had a brief parting in his letter of resignation, read during the public forum portion of senate.</p>\n<p>“In a final farewell, I leave you with this final task: Continue to uphold what’s best in our university, our student body and, most importantly, of yourselves,” Abdalmalik read from his resignation letter. “Hold yourselves to a higher standard, be inquisitive and, most importantly, be self-reflective and self-critical.”</p>\n<p>The resignations were passed in a Senate vote of 15-4-3.</p>\n<p>“A Bill to Restructure the A.S. Fellowship Program” and “A Bill to Amend Article VI of the Constitution &amp; By-Laws to Incorporate a Transfer Senator” were sent to campus affairs while “A Resolution to Ensure Continuity Within the STV Implementation Committee” was sent to immediate consideration and passed the same night.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67544\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/students-senate-discuss-free-speech-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67544\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/students-senate-discuss-free-speech-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/students-senate-discuss-free-speech-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/students-senate-discuss-free-speech-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/students-senate-discuss-free-speech-issues/","id":2555,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2554,2553,2552],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/91"}},"__N_SSG":true}
