During his time at UCSB he taught several courses regarding Blacks in sports and media and the Civil Rights Movement, and had a penchant for ruffling feathers with his unapologetic teaching style. Roque-Ramirez was an associate professor of Chican@ studies at UCSB until last year, teaching courses about LGBTQ and Chican@ narratives before passing away on December 25. Roque-Ramirez was born in Santa Ana, Salvador and in 1981 immigrated to the United States to escape the Salvadorian Civil War. He co-founded the Latin American Students Association at UCLA as an undergraduate and is remembered for his passion and resilience in academia.</p>\n<p>Faviana Hirsch-Dubin, former UCSB professor in the Chican@ Studies and education departments, knew both Madison and Roque-Ramirez during her time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“From the very first that I met Professor Roque-Ramirez, we had a magic connection … which I think a lot of people felt with him because he emanated that,” Hirsch-Dubin said. “[Madison] was the voice of reason when it came to race. His understandings were profound and he shared them and inspired many students over so many years.”</p>\n<p>Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, professor of Chican@ Studies, said both Madison and Roque-Ramirez were extremely influential during their time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Horacio was a brilliant man, not only in the regard of being a scholar,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “He used to say … ‘I’m a triple threat. I’m gay, I’m Salvadorian and I’m a historian and I’m really gonna … blow boundaries away,’ and that’s what he did. He was able to resonate with many people because he survived so much himself.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said Madison played an irreplaceable role in students’ lives, one that was made apparent by how much students cared for him as a professor.</p>\n<p>“They loved him in terms of what he passed on, he spoke truth to power — unflinchingly,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “He was just about standing up for life. Otis stood up for justice, for people that were hurting.”</p>\n<p>Sonya Baker, Feminist Studies Business Officer, said Madison and Roque-Ramirez were two “wonderful strong warriors” who influenced UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There was a teach-in about four years ago … and Otis was in that particular presentation. When he started talking, it was such a relief to hear someone talking without filters or without fear about the problems we face as people of color in this country,” Baker said. “It was fearsome and it was beautiful, and I loved it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67247\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67247\" data-attachment-id=\"67247\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/professor-vigil_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452187438\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Professor Vigil\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67247\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=750%2C501\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"750\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67247\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lola Mondragón, sixth-year graduate student in the Chican@ Studies department, said Roque-Ramirez as an educator and peer had an unspoken understanding of students’ needs.</p>\n<p>“I had gotten out of the military and was a survivor of trauma … we didn’t have a lot of words that we needed to share. He understood that,” Mondragón said. “He validated my experiences that I was having as a graduate student in the academy, a place that is very violent, especially against people of color and queer people like myself. We stand on the shoulders of great people and he will be one of those that I lean on.”</p>\n<p>Jamelia Harris, fourth-year Black Studies and sociology double major and co-chair of BSU, took <em>BL ST 50:</em> <em>Blacks in the Media</em> her second year and said students who weren’t in Madison’s class would often attend his lectures.</p>\n<p>“He definitely was intimidating to me initially. I can remember my first time entering his classroom and the first words he said to me were, ‘Do you think Barack Obama gives a fuck about you?’ and that was an interlude to his personality,” Harris said. “He was so unapologetic and so comfortable in who he was. He didn’t aim to please anyone … he made sure that black students’ voices were centered in his classroom.”</p>\n<p>Rosie Bermudez, fourth-year Chican@ Studies major, said she applied to the Chican@ Studies major because of Roque-Ramirez and his work recovering the stories of marginalized peoples’ lives.</p>\n<p>“I feel blessed that I was able to talk to him … enjoy his humor, his smile, and even though I only had a brief amount of time to know him, I feel he has truly impacted my life. It is really painful to know that their stories were not shared with more people,” Bermudez said.</p>\n<p>Oral historian at the UC Santa Cruz library Irene Reti first met Roque-Ramirez in Buffalo, New York at an oral history conference in 1998. Reti said Roque-Ramirez quickly became a visionary leader in the Oral History Association, doing “cutting-edge” work on queer oral history.</p>\n<p>“Horacio Roque Ramirez and I were among the first out queer oral historians in the Oral History Association. I had the pleasure of serving with him on the Oral History Executive Council,” Reti said in an email. “He did … inspirational work … especially co-editing <em>Bodies of Evidence: The Practice of Queer Oral History</em> with Nan Boyd. I will miss Horacio and am very sad at his passing.”</p>\n<p>Joanne Yansen Madison, wife of Otis Madison, briefly attended the vigil and was joined by her sister, Madison’s daughter and two sons in thanking attendees for their stories.</p>\n<p>“You know how [Otis] was … he would say, ‘Sure I’m great, I’m the greatest teacher they got!’ but it would always touch him when students would come back and say ‘I took your class and it changed my life,’” Joanne Madison said. “Thank you for standing out here tonight and for honoring your teachers, for learning more about your world and your society and for changing things.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67258\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67258\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/","id":2573,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2572,2571,2570],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Former UCSB Student Files Title IX Lawsuit Against UC Regents","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mastres_StorkePanorama.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mastres_StorkePanorama.jpg?resize=471%2C289&ssl=1","description":"Former UCSB student Haley Moore filed a Title IX Civil Lawsuit against the Regents of the University of California on Thursday, claiming UCSB failed to adequately address and investigate her case afte...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Former UCSB student Haley Moore filed a Title IX Civil Lawsuit against the Regents of the University of California on Thursday, claiming UCSB failed to adequately address and investigate her case after receiving the complaints in October 2014.</p>\n<p>Moore’s civil action case is based on “Gender Discrimination” under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a federal statute that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity that receives federal funding. According to the plaintiff, she suffered the loss of educational opportunities after being sexually assaulted in October 2014, ultimately being forced to withdraw from the university in January 2015 due to “deliberate indifference” on the part of the university.</p>\n<p>According to the case, Moore’s cousin reported the sexual assault to the police the morning after the incident. Moore provided a statement to UCPD and went to Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) the next day to schedule a counseling session. After Moore received a session with an intern seven to 10 days later, Moore’s father contacted Marisa Huston, Assistant Coordinator of Student Mental Health Services and requested his daughter be able to promptly meet with an experienced counselor. Moore met with Huston two to three days later and was allegedly made to wait 10 minutes and told that Huston was not obligated to the keep the contents of the meeting confidential. During this counseling session, Moore expressed concern about losing her financial aid and student housing if she dropped classes and was told by Huston that these could both be potential problems.</p>\n<p>The case states Kirsten Olson, the Assistant Clinical Director and Administrative Services Coordinator called Moore three to four days after the counseling session and scheduled a meeting for a few days later.</p>\n<p>“At the meeting, Olson immediately began talking to Moore about her grades. She asked Moore if Moore had considered withdrawing from UCSB. Moore informed Olson that she did not want to withdraw. Olson responded by questioning Moore’s decision not to withdraw, and informed Moore that there were counseling measures Moore could engage in during the time she was withdrawn from UCSB,” the case states.</p>\n<p>According to the case, Moore also had a phone call with Joe O’Brien, Assistant Dean and Director of Advising at UCSB, and was told that if she reduced her course load, she would be ineligible for both financial aid and UCSB housing. Moore also made efforts to switch her counselor at C.A.R.E., but ran into several roadblocks.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, Moore received a letter from UCSB informing her of academic probation due to poor academic performance during her first quarter at UCSB. In late January, four months after first reporting her assault to UCSB, Moore withdrew from the university.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff alleges that UCSB’s Title IX coordinator was never informed of her sexual assault report and that she was not provided adequate or timely counseling from C.A.R.E. after the sexual assault. Moore’s case also claims UCSB did not take any action to investigate Moore’s report of sexual assault by another UCSB student after she expressed a desire for some “remedial action” to be taken with regard to her report. In response to this request, the university allegedly told Moore an investigation would take a long time, be difficult emotionally and distract Moore from her studies. She was also told a school investigation would likely interfere with, and possibly even sabotage, the criminal investigation of Moore’s assault.</p>\n<p>The case also states Moore encountered the perpetrator of her sexual assault at least one time on campus after the incident, causing Moore to quickly leave the area after suffering a panic attack.</p>\n<p>“The mere presence on campus, without any restrictions, of the student that sexually assaulted Moore made Moore vulnerable to additional harassment and further exposed her to a sexually hostile environment,” the case states.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also claims she was deprived of several education opportunities, including but not limited to: a drop in her GPA, withdrawal from several classes, avoidance of several social activities on campus, the need to seek multiple accommodations from UCSB and eventual withdrawal from UCSB.</p>\n<p>“As a result of Defendant Trustees’ deliberate indifference, Plaintiff suffered loss of educational opportunities and/or benefits, has incurred and will continue to incur attorney fees and costs of litigation,” the case states.</p>\n<p>UCSB and the University of California Office of the President were both unable to comment, stating the case is currently pending litigation.</p>\n<p>UCSB Public Affairs office said while they could not comment on the case, the safety and well-being of students is the university’s highest priority, and students’ cases are treated with care and confidential advocacy.</p>\n<p>“If the student chooses to formally report their assault to the University, the allegations are thoroughly investigated and adjudicated in accordance with UC policy and government guidelines. We strive to ensure that our investigative processes are survivor-centered, but we understand that not every survivor opts to formally report their assault. In all cases we continue to offer support and counseling to assault survivors, as the safety and well-being of our students is our highest priority,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div

emotional issue. <em>Andrew Gates/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Students for Life of America hosted an event titled the “The Abortion Debate” between pro-choice UCSB professor of philosophy Quentin Gee and pro-life author Trent Horn to discuss abortion and women’s reproductive rights in the United States.</p>\n<p>Horn is the author of pro-life book Persuasive Pro-Life: How to Talk About Our Culture’s Toughest Issue, which claims to equip readers with the knowledge to be “a bold and effective apologist for the unborn.” Gee’s current research focuses on collective responsibility and the topic’s relation to ethical, political and legal philosophy. The debate format followed a 15-minute opening speech, 10-minute rebuttal and an eight-minute cross examination for each participant and ended with an audience Q&amp;A session. Ph.D. candidate in philosophy Keith Hess moderated the debate.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Opening the evening’s discussion, Gee said debates at universities cannot be based on religious dogma and should instead pursue a “practically available, publically moral status” for the issue. Gee then posed a hypothetical “thought experiment” about the ethicality of aborting fetuses.</p>\n<p>“If you were in a fertility clinic which was about to burn down, and you could save one infant in basket or save 10,000 embryos in cold storage, I doubt anyone would vote to save the embryos.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, the “cutoff line” for permissible abortion can operate at 23 weeks gestational age. Gee said although it is a contentious issue, the fetus cannot commonly feel pain at this stage.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it is necessarily wrong afterwards, but as a precaution to avoid a potential problem,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>Gee said those who factor religious reasoning into the abortion debate lack knowledge of embryotic life.</p>\n<p>“If you do in fact think the embryo has same status as baby, approximately 50 percent of embryos fail to lead to full pregnancy because of an inability to implant to the uterine wall,” Gee said. “By this logic, if you don’t think God is the number one baby death enabler, death is not indicative of the status of a fetus.”</p>\n<p>Gee said the core of his argument is that a fetus’s conceivable rights do not hold precedence to a woman’s rights in controlling her body.</p>\n<p>“A fetus and newborn baby, even if they have interests, doesn’t mean they trump all other interests,” Gee said. “I think it is possible for a woman to say ‘I cannot take care of this baby’ … it wouldn’t be looked upon well … but I think this is permissible.”</p>\n<p>In his introductory statement, Horn said it is generally wrong to directly kill innocent human beings, that fetuses are innocent human beings and that it is therefore wrong to kill fetuses.</p>\n<p>Horn then showed a series of photographs of fetuses at various stages of development from eight weeks to 22 weeks. According to Horn, abortion is the killing of a human being.</p>\n<p>“Abortion is not a passive removal of life, it is the act of killing a child via dismemberment,” Horn said. “It’s like giving someone a kidney and then ripping it out, killing him or her in a violent process.”</p>\n<p>Horn said because a fetus is a human with potential for growth, it follows that the fetus has the basic right to not be killed.</p>\n<p>“Saying an unborn is inhuman because it is just a fetus is like saying a 15-year-old is not a human because they are just a teenager,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>According to Horn, subjecting fetuses to a non-human status based on their inability to feel pain is an act of “ableism,” a form of discrimination based on stigmatizing disability. Horn also said Gee’s “thought experiment” is unfounded because logical decisions cannot be based on intuition.</p>\n<p>“My position is unborn [fetuses] are human organisms; all humans should have basic human rights regardless of their functional ability,” Horn said, “Just because we have different intuitions at different times doesn’t mean we should rely on our feelings. Instead, let’s look toward rational arguments.”</p>\n<p>The cross examination portion of the debate contrasted Horn’s requirement for a definition of personhood with Gee’s assertion that intuition plays a role in deciding the moral worth of a human in any stage.</p>\n<p>Gee said rather than a definition of personhood, the moral state of a fetus involves a “cluster of requirements.”</p>\n<p>“There is some sort of mental concept, no possibility for a rich mental life. It involves a conscious interest and desire to keep living,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>In response, Horn said a fetus does not need to consciously demonstrate its desire for life in order to be considered viable for the right of life.</p>\n<p>“I think you can have an interest in living without consciously alluding to it, because the zygote — there is some element of an interest in its living in terms of growth,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Horn and Gee began the Q&amp;A portion of the event by responding to the question of what would motivate the two participants to change their stance on the topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>Horn said he would require an argument separating the worth of humans with those of children.</p>\n<p>“I could be moved to change my mind if it could be shown that all human beings don’t have equal rights … that they don’t really have a right to live in the organ designed for them,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Gee said he would change his position if a fetus was shown to have certain mental capabilities.</p>\n<p>“I would require something on the order of showing that the organism in question has a deep, fairly rich mental life,” Gee said. “I think if you could show that, we could be concerned with killing the life.”</p>\n<p>In a closing statement, Gee said he would like to reassert his claim that a fetus’s rights should not be considered with more weight than a woman’s “deeply personal” autonomy over her own body.</p>\n<p>“While there is some value for whichever stage the zygote or fetus is in, I don’t think it is a value that trumps a woman’s right to bodily integrity,” Gee said. “If there was a body that had the same moral status as you and me, then there would be more value.”</p>\n<p>In Horn’s closing statement, he said humans should be defined and valued by their membership in a social community rather than their functional capabilities.</p>\n<p>“Human beings should be valued not for their functions, but because they belong to this community. I think an important question tonight is ‘Who are we allowed to kill?’” Horn said. “We should have a pit in our stomach regardless of whether it is a child or a fetus, because in the end, they all have the same intrinsic potential.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Delaney Forester said she wanted to further understand Horn’s position.</p>\n<p>“Horn made a comment earlier about a biological parent’s inherent responsibility to take care of a child unless they are deemed unfit,” Forester said. “My question is, what is the deciding factor in what makes you unfit?”</p>\n<p>Hess said the audience contributed to a civil and constructive debate, allowing both speakers to properly assert their views.</p>\n<p>“I liked how the students kept it civil. There wasn’t any … hot-heads or name-calling so I think this is the way that debates should be done,” Hess said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Students for Life of America President and fourth-year economics major Katie Devlin said the event was successful in fostering a productive discussion on the controversial topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>“I thought both speakers did a wonderful job. The audience also had really good questions,” Devlin said. “It was great how we could have a civil conversation about this sometimes controversial topic.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucsb-students-for-life-hosts-abortion-debate/","id":2642,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2641,2640,2639],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Komen for the Cure breast cancer research foundation.</p>\n<p>“We started this 10 to 15 years ago because one of our members passed away from ovarian cancer while attending UCSB, so it’s in memoriam of her,” Vlaco said. “We had over 300 participants last year and we raised over $5,000.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Susana Abdurahman said bringing transgender activist Cece McDonald to the Trans Revolution series at UCSB is extremely significant to the queer community because McDonald is a black transgender woman who was imprisoned in a men’s prison after defending herself from a racist and transphobic attack.</p>\n<p>“By defending herself, the man who attacked her was killed, and she was put in a men’s prison for 19 months,” Abdurahman said. “We are really excited to bring someone who has been a phenomenal activist for black and trans rights to come have a conversation with us about prison reform.”</p>\n<p>Co-captain of UCSB Surf Team and second-year pre-communication major Stephanie Schechter said because the team does not receive sufficient funding from the university, individual athletes must pay registration fees for the National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA).</p>\n<p>“We have 14 national titles, but unfortunately we don’t receive very much funding or donations,” Schechter said. “Our team has to pay our own travel expenses. Our yearly costs are about $14,820, so we are requesting registration funds for NSSA.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds Co-Publicity Chair and Co-Events Chair Marisa Jones said it is an honor for UCSB representatives to speak at the national conference, which will focus on the organization’s goal of eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been a five-star chapter at UCSB for six years in a row,” Jones said. “Only a few chapters have been able to speak, so we’re excited to be able to represent UCSB.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65285\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"718504292\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65328\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65285\" data-attachment-id=\"65285\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/finance-and-business_-by-oliver-zuniga-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444626351\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"53\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance and Business_ by Oliver Zuniga-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-65285\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=800%2C533\" alt=\"Oliver Zuniga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65285\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oliver Zuniga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) collegiate senator and third-year CCS biochemistry and bioengineering major Dustin Larrazolo motioned a discussion about funding for Greek organizations, saying there should be a lower funding limit for Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic events.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that all IFC or Pan groups are one entity, but I don’t think Greek organizations should be getting these blank checks,” Larrazolo said. “I also believe this is a conflict of interest because there are IFC members here. It doesn’t seem entirely appropriate; if we do fund [Greek organizations] there should be a smaller cap.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo also said A.S funds should be reserved for students who require funding to attend the university.</p>\n<p>“I think these funds should be going toward students of color, undocumented students, students who require resources to continue attending the university as opposed to building up haunted house for I.V. Youth,” Larrazolo said. “I think that’s great, but it’s not our job to be a sponsor.”</p>\n<p>Chief Financial Officer of F&amp;B Kevin Koo said he does not oppose the allocation of funds to Greek organizations because they comprise a large portion of the student population.</p>\n<p>“They are accessing a lot of students and they are raising a lot of money. It’s beneficial for the community and the school,” Koo said. “I think the bigger issue is if philanthropies fall within our guidelines — if they do, I don’t see a problem with that.”</p>\n<p>Assistant Director for Finance and Budgets Cindy Lopez told F&amp;B about A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal’s plans to reallocate $9,000 from the A.S. Leadership fund to use for professional development.</p>\n<p>Senator Larrazolo also introduced a Bill to Redefine the A.S. Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital Fund (S.T.A.R.K.), amending the bill to allocate $4,000 dollars to the CCS student council and $4,000 dollars to the College of Engineering student council. According to Larrazolo, the current S.T.A.R.K. fund is meant to stimulate science research but is generally discussed in A.S. senate meetings rather than made accessible to CCS and the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>“I can’t speak for the College of Engineering, but through CCS we require students to participate at a quarterly symposium at CCS,” Larrazolo said. “When someone receives funding we want to make sure they’ve actually made progress and [are] completing their mission statement.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65328\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65328\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/","id":3986,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3985,3984,3983],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Event Discusses Combating I.V.

Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The MultiCultural Center (MCC) and English professor Felice Blake hosted a remembrance event on Tuesday in the MCC to create a healing space for students, staff and faculty affected by the events of May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p>Attendees discussed ways to combat racism and sexism in Isla Vista in context of the anniversary of the shooting. The event was facilitated by third-year film major Ashley Baker, who led group activities with Blake and encouraged participants to express their emotions and acknowledge words of healing such as “faith,” “hope” and “power,” as well as words that reflect wounds such as “fear,” “anger,” and “alone.” Blake focused on community building and different resources and systems of support for those who have gone through difficult experiences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even if we want to take up issues of race or sexuality, we realize that we don’t all experience these things in the same way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Blake, increasing police presence and surveillance as a response to the events of May 23 last year has exacerbated the pre-existing tensions between students of color and law enforcement, specifically issues of profiling and biased arrests.</p>\n<p>“Even while these students [of color] believe that safety is a pressing concern, we don’t automatically share the same ideas of safety and security and protection just because we happen to be affiliated with UCSB,” Blake said. “Even if we want to take up issues of race or sexuality, we realize that we don’t all experience these things in the same way.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Womyn’s Commission’s supporting chair and third-year comparative literature and global studies double major Cassie Rubio said administrators reacted to the events of May 23 last year incorrectly. According to Rubio, administrators increased policing while failing to address the roots of the problem, sexism and racism.</p>\n<p>“The increased militant police presence that we now have … is really harmful to communities of color, women, other marginalized groups who have histories with police presence,” Rubio said. “What has not changed is the administration’s failure and blatant erasure of misogyny and racism and serious issues that we need to deal with on our campus. We need more healing spaces that are more focused and informed of these issues.”</p>\n<p>Several attendees recounted their experiences entering the university last fall, expressing they expected an open and loving environment but were faced instead with sexism and racism. One attendee described UCSB’s environment as “disappointing” due to the prevalence of student-filed sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>Participants used the space to discuss their individual emotions about the events of May 23 last year, describe memories and offer advice for those experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and other lasting effects.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Response Network Operations team leader Anthony Rodriguez said students experiencing trauma should recognize there are others who care and many who feel the same way. According to Rodriguez, students have the ability to strengthen Isla Vista through unity.</p>\n<p>“Know that you are not alone, whatever you are feeling — no one can change that,” Rodriguez said. “But there’s so much to do to empower your community. I.V. is not alone. You guys have heart and that’s a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Director of the MCC Zaveeni Khan-Marcus said UCSB should increase representative conversations because, while the events of May 23 last year were shared experiences for the entire student body, they affect individuals differently.</p>\n<p>“[We discussed] the sense of isolation and loneliness that impedes us from creating a community and trying to help each other,” Khan-Marcus said. “Of course everyone came together during the tragedy but two years from now, one will not have a common thread. And then how do we love?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Know that you are not alone, whatever you are feeling — no one can change that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Baker said she is pleased to see how rapidly the campus has grown in the past year.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing the campus grow from last year to this year has been pretty phenomenal,” Baker said. “Of course it’s still going to have its cold spaces. I just see how precious life is and I don’t want to waste a minute of it. Even if it’s scary, I try to push myself to do things I don’t normally do.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/","id":2745,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2744,2743,2742],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The important thing is that education around trauma is vital … trauma is very treatable.”</p>\n<p>Cohen aims to help those affected by the events of May 23 last year understand their emotions are normal, ASAP Coordinator John Berberet said.</p>\n<p>“It’s our way of helping people come to terms with it or help people find some meaning and moving on, not in the spirit of forgetting or disregarding, but to find some meaning and understanding,” Cohen said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The important thing is that education around trauma is vital … trauma is very treatable. – Psychologist Beth Cohen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Berberet said one goal of the discussion is to help the individuals understand repressed emotions that may surface during the week of May 23.</p>\n<p>“People that experience and examine trauma in the past in another part of their life — some of that stuff can get stirred up again when another traumatic event happens,” Berberet said.</p>\n<p>Berberet said he anticipates that the first anniversary of the events of May 23 last year will be difficult for I.V. and UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Especially with the first anniversary, there’s something about our human nature we sort of reassess and reexamine what is going on in our lives that we to have memorialize to help us heal,” Berberet said.</p>\n<p>Berberet said I.V. residents and UCSB students, staff and faculty have found unique ways of healing since May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“Wonderful people are finding … ways of dealing or finding memorials or rituals that are moving forward for the community,” Berberet said.</p>\n<p><em>ASAP encourages faculty and staff to attend one of the two sessions and also welcomes students to the discussion, in addition to the services Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) will continue to offer throughout the week.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to Hackett, students need spaces to discuss their losses and to share tragedy preventative measures.</p>\n<p>“I think that this is something that really just meets a need at UCSB,” Hackett said. “We lose students pretty much every year either to accidental death or to suicide and it’s a way to just give people a space to honor people.”</p>\n<p>Hackett also said she hopes the vigil was a place for survivors to “leave feelings behind” and participate in healing interactions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the times we’re talking more about prevention or intervention and there’s not a lot of time to talk about those that we have lost,” Hackett said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and C.A.P.S. student health peer Melina Mossberg said the candlelight vigil was meant to welcome a variety of students, not just those who have lost someone to suicide. Mossberg also said she hopes to continue hosting events that will adapt to meet the needs of the UCSB community in the future.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time and we’re trying it out and, hopefully, this will be something that we’ll continue doing in the future,” Mossberg said. “People will always have this space and they’ll have an opportunity to come and even just be allies if they haven’t lost somebody.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it’s important for survivors, for the people who are here, to be able to honor the person that they’ve lost and also to just raise awareness about suicide, just so they know people care. – C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford</p></blockquote>\n<p>C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford said C.A.P.S. hopes to host similar events during Suicide Prevention Month in the fall to continue providing an outlet for people to support each other and share their experiences.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for survivors, for the people who are here, to be able to honor the person that they’ve lost and also to just raise awareness about suicide, just so they know people care,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and psychology double major Nelson Moreno said the vigil was another step towards the removal of the stigma surrounding mental health issues, and served to bring students together, especially given the May 11 Sabado Tarde incident.</p>\n<p>“It’s been done in other UCs and I think having it here in Santa Barbara will promote an understanding and compassion toward people that have completed suicide,” Moreno said. “I think this month can be very triggering to students especially with the tragedy.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Janice Ong said students need opportunities to discuss sensitive issues such as suicide at events like the candlelight vigil.</p>\n<p>“It helps students understand and gives them a safe space to talk,” Ong said. “I feel like suicide is not talked about a lot; it’s really sensitive and … this gives a safe and healing space for students who have maybe experienced any of that in their life.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Novak developed the idea for the installation, titled <em>Hesperus is Phosphorus</em> (The Evening Star Carries Light).</p>\n<p>The event is the first of two memorial projects to light the tunnel from campus to I.V., the other being an interactive light installation inside Pardall Tunnel. A third lighting project, Blunite, created by students in art professor Kim Yasuda’s class, I.V. Open Lab, will illuminate I.V. and the campus with blue lights using Professor Shuji Nakamura’s Nobel Prize-wining LED technology.</p>\n<p>Novak said he wants the Field of Light project to resemble a field of poppies during the day and stars in the sky at night.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to do something with a field of poppies that looked like stars,” Novak said. ‘The only way we can do this is with solar lights — they’re sustainable, we don’t need wiring and they’ll come on at night. They’ll be like a star field and you can look up at the sky.”</p>\n<p>According to Novak, community participation is a key part of social change.</p>\n<p>“It really takes an effort on everyone’s part to keep the world civilized,” Novak said. “It’s about what we build together. It’s the effort we put in together. And to highlight the things the world wants to encourage and diminish the things we don’t want to encourage.”</p>\n<p>Novak said he hopes art installments like the Field of Light will increase safety on campus.</p>\n<p>“This project is hopefully a beginning so we can do more such interventions on campus,” Novak said. “Not only annually as a reference but throughout. It’s already very beautiful but we can make it more beautiful.”</p>\n<p>Novak said though Pardall Tunnel is frequently used, it is poorly lit and will better connect I.V. and campus once the lighting projects are complete.</p>\n<p>“The main thing is to let people know that they’re welcome to campus, to let people know they’re safe when they exit campus,” Novak said. “To form a bridge between Isla Vista and campus and to make the presence of people in the tunnel important and illuminated.”</p>\n<p>Bhavnani said her goal is to unite the community through the solar light display and to celebrate the lives of those who passed away on May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“We are honoring those who were lost,” Bhavnani said. “We want to plant the solar lights as a way to bring the community together in act of common remembrance.”</p>\n<p>According to Bhavnani, the event is a way to remember those who passed away last spring, and the use of LED lights helps to honor Nakamura’s achievement, as well.</p>\n<p>“I want do something for the campus and I think this is a wonderful way to remember those who are deceased and to bring light into our lives,” Bhavnani said. “Especially with Shuji Nakamura being awarded a Nobel prize, that’s also a type of honor. Somehow it all comes together.”</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year mathematics major Anjali Naicker said she encourages people to volunteer as part of a community healing process.</p>\n<p>“I really hope everyone comes and becomes a part of this artwork,” Naicker said. “The art is beautiful and it will be really magical in a way.”</p>\n<p>Naicker said the event is especially significant because the domestic dispute Monday evening on Sabado Tarde Road triggered emotions in many students.</p>\n<p>“We really need this, especially right now,” Naicker said. “It brought back a lot of anger and painful memories. How dare the media bring these feelings back? We need to heal now more than ever and I feel grateful to be a part of such a beautiful event.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/","id":2766,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2765,2764,2763],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Goleta Reaches no Decision on AB 3 Endorsement","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/goleta.jpg?resize=200%2C200&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/goleta.jpg?resize=200%2C200&ssl=1","description":"Committee members voted to delay a decision to endorse Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) during the Goleta City Council special session meeting Tuesday until the next regularly scheduled city council meeting on ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Committee members were not able to come to a consensus on the endorsement of Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) during the Goleta City Council special session meeting Tuesday and no further has discussion has been scheduled.</p>\n<p>The office of Assemblyman Das Williams and the Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative are currently hosting the Week of AB 3, a week-long series of events to inform students and residents of AB 3 before the bill goes the California State Assembly Committee on Local Government next Wednesday. As part of this series, UC Santa Barbara students, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students and Goleta and Isla Vista residents attended the City Council meeting with the intent of securing a council endorsement for AB 3.</p>\n<p>Williams introduced AB 3 in December 2014 to propose establishing I.V. as a community services district (CSD) to address the lack of self-governance in Isla Vista. A CSD would be funded by local taxes and improve local infrastructure and public services. The Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is a state-mandated agency that oversees the formation of CSDs, however the I.V. CSD would bypass the LAFCO formation process by act of the state legislature.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We can’t continue being unincorporated and keep the status quo, because the status quo has shown to be disastrous. – Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said establishing a CSD is necessary to address the issues facing I.V.</p>\n<p>“We can’t continue being unincorporated and keep the status quo, because the status quo has shown to be disastrous,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Associated Students off-campus senator and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez said a CSD would provide residents the opportunity to voice the community’s needs and to change I.V.’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“AB 3 is the best chance we have to have Isla Visa take control of itself and in a responsible way turn things that are difficulties now into benefits, to turn the reputation of Isla Vista into a boon for the entire area,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>LAFCO commissioner and California Special Districts Association president Craig Geyer said the bill bypasses the LAFCO formation process and should not be included in the Goleta city agenda.<br>\n“The funding source is usually utility tax which is reserved for cities and counties,” Geyer said. “Speaking as a resident of Goleta, I don’t think Goleta has a stick in this fire.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At this point a lot of the information we’ve asked for to make a decision has not been brought forward. We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this. – Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double major Cameron Schunk said the discussion on the financial feasibility report outlining the expenses of a CSD is unrelated to the current passage of the bill to committee. Schunk also said LAFCO “continuously misrepresents facts” regarding details of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Consistently property owners, long-term I.V. residents and other groups have been undermining the passage of the self-governance movement and AB 3,” Schunk said. “To say that AB 3 isn’t self-governance while recommending the existing power structures maintain control is not only disingenuous but also misleading.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said the LAFCO process of discussing financial aspects of a CSD is “crucial” in making the decision to endorse a bill.</p>\n<p>“At this point a lot of the information we’ve asked for to make a decision has not been brought forward,” Soutar said. “We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Lanny Ebenstein said creating a CSD is a long overdue step, as shown by recent tragic events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was tragedy in many respects that led to this proposal coming forward,” Ebenstein said. “It was the clear evidence that the current government structure for Isla Vista is not working.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created. – Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch</p></blockquote>\n<p>Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch said Goleta should not partake in the CSD except to address issues of safety, such as establishing ordinances for Deltopia and Halloween weekends. According to Murdoch, these specific ordinances are county-wide and can be executed from within Goleta without the need for a CSD.</p>\n<p>“By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created,” Murdoch said. “If I.V. was part of Goleta then specific unique ordinances could be drafted to solve these specific unique problems.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, conversations on the CSD’s financial feasibility will not be relevant for months to come and have distracted from the discussion on endorsement of the bill.</p>\n<p>“We will need the feasibility study to determine the rate of the tax but we won’t be determining the rate for maybe another year,” Abboud said. “The CSD law says you’re allowed to have a laundry list of taxes that can be specified later, it’s not important to the fast-paced process of the bill right now.”</p>\n<p>Goleta City councilmember Michael T. Bennett said AB 3 is not perfect, but I.V. issues are intrinsically tied to Goleta city issues and should be supported by the council. Bennett said the effectiveness of the I.V. Recreation and Parks Department suggests a CSD that includes students and long-term residents could be successful.</p>\n<p>“I think as a beginning point it’s an opportunity for people to determine their own destiny,” Bennett said. “What gives me the most faith that it can actually work is, in fact, the Parks and Rec Department. When that was proposed there were many naysayers … but it has succeeded way beyond anyone’s expectation and has shown that it can work with students and those that are residents with the community.”</p>\n<p>After the discussion, committee members took a group vote to postpone the discussion to May 19 to discuss the matter with Mayor Paula Perotte, who could not attend the meeting due to sickness. The motion failed and the committee adjourned to regular meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*This is an updated version of this article.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

scholars, selected UC Santa Barbara mechanical engineering Professor Megan Valentine to receive a Fulbright Scholar Award on December 22, announced in a press release by UCSB on April 27.</p>\n<p>As part of the program, Valentine will research soft material sciences at ESPCI ParisTech, a physics and chemistry college, in the fall of 2015 with ESPCI ParisTech materials science professor Costantino Creton.</p>\n<p>Valentine joined the Mechanical Engineering Department in 2008, after earning a Ph.D. in physics at Harvard University and completing a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University in the Biological Sciences Department. Valentine’s studies in soft materials research focuses on how forces are generated and transmitted in living materials, and how these forces control cellular outcomes.</p>\n<p>Valentine said one goal of her research is to pave the way for women and underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (S.T.E.M.) fields through teaching and outreach.</p>\n<p>“The outstanding record of ESPCI ParisTech in the recruitment and retention of women to S.T.E.M. fields was one of the many attractions in selecting it, and France, for my sabbatical,” Valentine said. “I hope to return to UCSB with a better understanding of how the French educational system engages and supports female students, and suggestions for how the U.S. system could be improved.”</p>\n<p>Mechanical Engineering Department Chair Francesco Bullo said Valentine’s research makes important strides in addressing problems posed in the medical field.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Valentine is an extremely productive and talented researcher,” Bullo said. “Her project, ‘Creating tough, fatigue-resistant materials, inspired by nature,’ leverages her expertise in biological systems and protein engineering while tackling important new problems in materials research, specifically bio-inspired self-healing materials.”</p>\n<p>According to Valentine, the materials in her study operate similarly to the technology in bike helmets, which employ a “controlled collapse” of a foamy core to absorb impact energy and protect our skulls.</p>\n<p>“My focus is on developing materials that can dissipate energy during loading through the controlled breakage of sacrificial bonds,” Valentine said. “This approach of toughening by weakening is not new … but the work proposed here goes further by incorporating reversible bonding schemes that allow the sacrificial bonds to reform when the load is removed, thus allowing the materials to ‘heal.’”</p>\n<p>Valentine said her research builds upon previous studies in producing improved adhesives and drug transportation vehicles, working toward a deeper understanding of the properties of living materials in synthetic systems.</p>\n<p>“I am particularly excited about biomedical applications and the development of materials for use in artificial heart valves, vascular grafts and joint repair,” Valentine said.</p>\n<p>Bullo said Valentine’s research will also allow for a continuing relationship with ESPCI ParisTech.</p>\n<p>“Her selection as a Fulbright awardee recognizes the excellence of her scholarship and her contributions to education and science,” Bullo said. “I am extremely proud of her accomplishments and look forward to the increased interactions with ESPCI ParisTech facilitated by this award.”</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Ryan Tsukamoto said materials research can be applied to many aspects of science, engineering and biomedical processes.</p>\n<p>“I believe that investigation of living materials will provide valuable insight to not only medicine but all fields of science and engineering,” Tsukamoto said. “A better understanding of how living structures interact will definitely enhance medical diagnosis and treatment methods.”</p>\n<p>Valentine said collaborating with Creton’s research group will allow her to broaden her expertise in biomaterials and protein<br>\nmechanics.</p>\n<p>“I will also introduce the Creton group to the novel measurement tools that my group has developed for materials testing, in particular our suite of customized ‘magnetic tweezers’ tools which allow the application of very local forces to soft materials for spatially-resolved materials characterization,” Valentine said. “I also hope that my stay in Paris leads to long-term,</p>\n<p>fruitful collaborations between ESPCI and UCSB.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A version of this story said “Valentine’s studies in soft materials research primarily involve the production of man-made materials”, however Valentine’s studies focus on living systems and the previous is true only for her research with the Fulbright Scholarship. The article also incorrectly stated Valentine received the award on April 27 when she was notified of her selection on December 22. The article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/","id":2770,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2769,2768,2767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Of the three clubs requesting funding, the Black Student Union (BSU) received the full request for $4,300 from the Culture and Graduation budget. The Queer People of Color Collective and Active Minds did not receive funding. The committee also granted a request to reallocate funding for an upcoming Sigma Pi Epsilon fraternity fundraiser.</p>\n<p>Black Culture Week co-chair and second-year black studies major Mikayla Williams said BSU’s Black Culture Week event will kick-off with a barbeque May 18 and include several cultural activities, including a film screening, spoken word night and candlelight vigil to remember Malcolm X and Yuri Kochiyama, a Japanese-American human rights activist and a member of Malcolm X’s Organization of Afro-American Unity.</p>\n<p>“Tuesday [May 19] is actually the birthday of Malcolm X so we will be holding an event commemorating his birthday as well Yuri Kochiyama’s, with a candlelight vigil to honor them,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A.S President Ali Guthy also presented the President’s Agenda and said the Academic Affairs Board budget has been cut due to its recent merge with the Office of the Internal Vice President.</p>\n<p>In assessing the allocation of funds for Queer People of Color Conference and Active Minds, A.S. Finance and Business Committee advisor Cindy Lopez reminded senators the OSL budget is at $0 and that senate unallocated fees should be kept primarily for A.S. expenses.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/","id":2806,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2805,2804,2803],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Self-Governance Bill AB 3 was written by Assemblyman Das Williams and proposes to make I.V. a community services district (CSD), which would allow I.V. to levy taxes in order to provide services such as additional lighting, parking, community maintenance and advocacy through elected board members. LAFCO has drafted a letter of concern over the bill, requiring it to pass through their jurisdiction before progressing into the state legislature.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the initial opposition to the bill stemmed from LAFCO members’ concern over not being involved and informed about the process.</p>\n<p>“I think that LAFCO members are concerned because normally when we talk about making a community services district, it would go through LAFCO, not the state legislature,” Farr said. “That’s why a special meeting has been called to decide whether to send a letter or not.”</p>\n<p>Farr said sending the bill to state legislature does not necessarily exclude LAFCO from being involved with the creation of a CSD and that after the bill is drafted in its entirety there will be a chance to determine whether LAFCO will approve it or not.</p>\n<p>“Because we don’t know what the final bill language is, it’s entirely possible LAFCO will be involved,” Farr said. “Actually when the legislature passed a similar bill to create a college district for Isla Vista 30–40 years ago, they did part of and it gave it to LAFCO to draft another part.”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO’s involvement is vital in order to ensure the bill can last in the state legislature.</p>\n<p>“They have hearings here in the community: it’s easier to go than to go up to Sacramento to testify for something,” said Farr.</p>\n<p>Farr said if the city wants to change the boundaries of a district, they have to go through LAFCO, and defining a specific district for the CSD requires LAFCO’s jurisdiction. Applying for a change in boundaries or districts involves a process during which proponents must obtain a certain amount of community support via petition form, pay an application fee and submit payment for fiscal analysis. According to Farr, this process is difficult to carry out in I.V. because of the temporary nature of the residents.</p>\n<p>“In a community like IV it’s very challenging to go through this process because [the process] is designed for permanent long term residents,” Farr said. “That’s part of why something like this hasn’t happened before by being generated from within the community.”</p>\n<p>In regard to finding a solution to what Farr described as a lack of permanent resident responsibility in I.V., Farr said there has been some discussion regarding changing boundaries to include university-owned housing and involve more students and staff in the self-governance discussion.</p>\n<p>“Who would decide that is the question right now, would it be the chancellor or the county, it would work to bring the community more longevity and stability,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, LAFCO will be able to take a position on the matter when the language of the AB 3 is finalized. Farr also said it is difficult to detail specific aspects of the CSD, such as policing powers.</p>\n<p>“The CSD could have policing powers but law enforcement services are extremely expensive,” Farr said, “We would have to find more money as opposed to letting the county continue to foot that bill.”</p>\n<p>Farr said a facet of the community the CSD might be able to address is referred to as the “broken window effect,” which is when a community starts to look bad or degrade and then becomes more attractive for individuals to continue to destroy as opposed to maintain.</p>\n<p>“It kind of comes back to the built environment and having housing that’s attractive that makes students want to stay in the community after they graduate, creating a group of less temporary residents in Isla Vista,” Farr said.<br>\nAccording to Farr, I.V. requires a newly modeled CSD to address issues of public safety in the neighborhood due to its uniqueness, and there has always been student interest in the matter.</p>\n<p>“We need to address a model that is different than what we’ve done before. That’s what the committee member is working on right now,” Farr said. “There’s always been a lot of student interest from the very beginning, and ever since I’ve been in office there hasn’t been a six month period gone by when a student hasn’t brought up CSD and LAFCO.”</p>\n<p>Farr said a special meeting will be held one week from today to discuss a new draft for AB 3, and despite the fate of the letter, LAFCO and the State legislature will continue tracking the bill and making suggestions.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a new issue though. What’s happened is that incidents that occurred last spring really galvanized the community, university and trustees,” Farr said. “AB 3 came out of the trustees’ report and this was their ultimate recommendation. It is definitely time once again to explore what options are out there and make some changes,” Farr said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

During his lecture, Kristof spoke about his time reporting in various conflict-ridden areas around the globe as well as about what he calls the “empathy gap,” a phenomenon in current news reporting which fails to follow up on the need for action in areas facing humanitarian crises.</p>\n<p>According to Appelbaum, Kristof’s work has led him to extraordinary situations while traveling. For instance, the Chinese government denied Kristof a visa due to his New York Times reporting on ethnic cleansing in Sudan, for which Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu calls Kristof an “honorary African,” Appelbaum said.</p>\n<p>“Nick is a deeply engaged journalist, a relentless educator,” Appelbaum said. “Santa Barbara is the most benign place he is likely to visit. Nick subscribes to the Indiana Jones school of journalism.”</p>\n<p>Kristof’s newly published book, co-written with his wife Sheryl WuDunn, A Path Appears, addresses one of the constraints of global philanthropic efforts, which Kristof describes as “an empathy gap.”</p>\n<p>“The starting point is to chip away at this distance, build a broader scope of empathy and agreement,” Kristof said. “When you encounter need, you respond. Poverty is not just an economic failing, it is a moral failing on the part of people who can help.”</p>\n<p>Kristof said while “there is a deep human yearning for silver bullets,” in reality it takes a consistent effort of small actions to “collectively have an impact” on global crises.</p>\n<p>“It’s because of this kind of change that I believe extreme poverty is going to be eliminated on our watch,” Kristof said. “I’m a great believer in education, in my opinion it’s the best escalator out of poverty. But when we have tools and knowledge that would transform the lives of children and we don’t implement them, there is a real irresponsibility on the part of society as well.”</p>\n<p>According to Kristof, the tendency of journalists to “avoid … hopefulness” has created a flaw within news reporting.</p>\n<p>“We leave the impression that Africa is crashing when in fact there are amazing things going on,” Krisof said. “The problem is that the worst in the world is often next to the best. We need to convey triumphs as well as disasters of human conviction.”</p>\n<p>Kristof also said people and governments fail to use all the tools available to address crises, such as the recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.</p>\n<p>“We should have learned from AIDS,” Kristof said. “You have to intervene early, but there was no rush with Ebola partially due to indifference. We could have stopped [Ebola] at a huge saving of money and lives.”</p>\n<p>Kristof also said he is concerned with the public disinterest in current news, discussing an ABC TV special on global health and the subsequent cancellation of the special.</p>\n<p>“The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation had bribed ABC to cover global health issues, and by bribe I mean a grant,” Kristof said. “After one series, ABC News said that they didn’t want the money from the foundation anymore because viewers switched the channel when these programs came on. Is there no business model to cover really important stories?”</p>\n<p>Kristof said he predicts the reporting and covering of important stories will decline further in the coming decade.</p>\n<p>“If you think we’ve dropped the ball in the last 10 years, it will get worse in the next ten years,” Kristof said.</p>\n<p>According to Kristof, George Clooney was a “terrific travel partner” during their time traveling to Darfur, Sudan, in 2009, where Clooney hoped to draw media attention to the genocide in Darfur.</p>\n<p>“We shared a room in Darfur that has a huge bloodstain on the wall, it was never explained,” Kristof said. “When we involved celebrities in our novel we were worried it would cheapen issues, but at the end of the day it is difficult to get people’s attentions to these issues.”</p>\n<p>Political science graduate student Shannon Schumacher, who participated in the Q&amp;A portion of the lecture, said that while she was a “little bit disappointed” by the lack of structure in Kristof’s argument, she expressed appreciation that Kristof offered solutions to the problems he presented.</p>\n<p>“Some key points I really did enjoy were his comments on his idea of the empathy gap and trying to generate how can people see things from other sides and how can we as individuals really feel empowered to help,” Schumacher said. “I like that he offered suggestions of how to do that but I was looking for a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>Recent alumnus and former biology major Andrew Floren was able to speak with Kristof before the lecture, which he said offered him a “unique perspective” on topics discussed during the lecture.</p>\n<p>“I asked him how he keeps his idealism and he kind of touched upon it,” Floren said. “‘It’s being out in the field and doing a lot of work,’ [he said] and I just looked him in the eye and I understood because I’ve been out in the field as well internationally and it’s something where once you see that, you can’t look away you can’t ignore it.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies and communication major Katie Koerper said while the lecture did not give her a clear idea of what she will pursue after graduation, Kristof’s lecture “reignites the fire of really wanting to help people.”</p>\n<p>“I think this is very inspiring for me because I hear, as well as study, a lot about these topics,” Koerper said.<br>\nWhile concluding his lecture, Kristof said each individual has their own “spotlight” they can use to move change in the world.</p>\n<p>“Whether it be your Twitter, Facebook, book clubs or bulletin boards,” Kristof said. “Use these lights to shed information on the important issues. As we drop the ball, I hope you guys can pick it back up.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58339\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58339\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/","id":2975,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2974,2973,2972],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/91"}},"__N_SSG":true}
