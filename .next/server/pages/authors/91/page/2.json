Less than 30 officers are expected to patrol on Sunday and Monday, he said.</p>\n<p>UCPD will be sourcing officers from seven different University of California campuses to supplement its staff. Officers from Los Angeles, Irvine, UC San Diego, San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Riverside will arrive at UCSB on Oct. 27 to attend a one-day training prior to Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nearly 100 UCPD officers were present in I.V. last year, Signa said, but this year “there’s a better understanding within the whole community, this idea of trying to keep it safe, keep it local.” He said initiatives like UC Isla Vista Volunteering Program have been “fantastic” at drawing students away from parties and toward local events.</p>\n<p>Although the department hopes to gradually decrease police presence by higher increments, “we’re always kind of nervous about what’s going to happen,” Signa said. UCPD can call on the Santa Barbara Police Department and additional UC officers in the case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>IVFP, an offshoot of the Santa Barbara County Police Department, plans to post approximately 100 officers in I.V. on Friday and Saturday, 50 officers on Sunday and 75 on Monday, according to IVFP Sergeant Chris Gotschall.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73145\" style=\"width: 466px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73145\" data-attachment-id=\"73145\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/policestats/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"357,181\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"policestats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=250%2C127&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73145\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?resize=456%2C200\" alt=\"Icon courtesy of Symbolon; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus\" width=\"456\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=456%2C200 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=456%2C200 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73145\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Icon courtesy of Symbolon, Noun Project; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The department came to the decision after coordinating with both UCPD and UCSB administration. “Based on how much quieter Halloween was last year, they determined that they could actually decrease their coverage.” Gotschall said.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that this is a good sign; that things are more manageable in Isla Vista and on campus and the need for the presence of police officers is less,” Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said.</p>\n<p>IVFP officers arrested less than 30 people during Halloween weekend last year, down from over 100 in years prior, and crime is expected to stay low this year. The department currently has no plans to bring horses into I.V. as mounted patrol units, but Gotschall said this could change in case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want unsafe parties, we don’t want people coming in from all over to cause mischief,” he said.</p>\n<p>Because Halloween falls on a Monday this year, less activity is expected on Halloween Day. Gotschall said approximately 188 officers were patrolling I.V. on both weekend days in 2011, the last time Halloween was on a Monday.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, external vice president of local affairs, plans to continue alternative programming from last year.

Baxter was a former campaign assistant for Steve Pappas, who the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2008-05-27/for-3rd-district-supervisor-the-daily-nexus-strongly-endorses-steve-pappas/\" target=\"_blank\">endorsed </a>during his race for Third District Supervisor in 2008.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id=\"m_8610659200238821933gmail-docs-internal-guid-62726dd1-98b9-879a-f4c3-165575577e28\">“I don’t have a deathbed conversion here.

Freeman is not a registered Democrat and said the race for the Third District has reaffirmed his decision against doing so.</p>\n<p>Freeman added that the idea of political representation in I.V. is very subjective, and though voter registration is essential, the I.V. vote also suppresses the vote of agriculture land in the rest of the Third District and the Santa Ynez Valley. A balanced election would require full voter participation from all areas.</p>\n<p>Political tension runs high in the months before the primary, and Freeman, as well as Andrew Gabriel Pragin, a supporter and former UCSB student, expressed concern that Democratic voter registration tactics were dissuading others from being engaged in the election.</p>\n<p>Abboud denied that the party encourages voters to side with Democrats, and said “we do nonpartisan voter registration when we need to. We do it because we care about voters.”</p>\n<p>Students and candidates campaigning for the crucial I.V. vote have found themselves at the center of a crossfire between party lines, and the intensity of the environment continues to increase.</p>\n<p>Democrats hoped to espouse the idea that “Isla Vista is united,” Pragin said, but the campaign continues to forge a split between political activists in the crucial election.</p>\n<p>“It provides a front of openness, transparency,” he said. “In reality, they’re doing quite a lot of work to make it seem that way.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em> under the headline “Isla Vista at the Heart of Third District Vote.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/","id":3909,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3908,3907,3906],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Transfer Center Opens in the Library","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Transfer-Center-by-Christopher-Chen-PRINT-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Transfer-Center-by-Christopher-Chen-PRINT-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara held a grand opening for the transfer student center in the UCSB Library on Wednesday, celebrating a work in progress since the library opened doors in January.

A County Redevelopment Agency planned to build a new space soon after, but the agency was later dissolved entirely due to financial setbacks.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 2012, the County of Santa Barbara acquired a former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, bringing the fight for a community center back to the very heart of I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The location is adjacent to the Community Resource Building, Anisq’Oyo’ Park, the I.V. Food Co-Op and the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks Department, a few historical tenants of community organization in I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 Community Development Block Grant in 2015 to refurbish the former church building, the building seemed to be in promising hands.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Office of External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) held a launch party last October to celebrate the future renovations, and local groups began using the facilities for informal events.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Friends of the Isla Vista Community Center (IVCC), a group that has been meeting regularly for two years, began working with the budget to hire an architecture firm, create a single bathroom facility and refurbish a simple kitchen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The money has since dwindled down, and the county funding is all used up, bringing organizers to a $100,000 deficit. While the infrastructure additions are a huge step up for several Isla Vistans, others are unimpressed with the community center’s finances and longevity.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We’re putting money into building a warehouse in Isla Vista,” Lanny Ebenstein, longtime I.V. resident and professor of economics at UCSB, said at a meeting during the summer. The building is functional, but Ebenstein said the concrete flooring, limited lighting and versatility will make it an inappropriate central gathering space.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“For programming to be effective, you have to have a facility that people want to use,” he said. “The project that’s coming out, it’s probably the worst I’ve seen in my years of public planning.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Skip Grey, county representative for the IVCC and a member of a county ad-hoc committee, said the goal during initial construction was to build a “shell” that could be used minimally. “We had the money so we wanted to build as much as we could,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The shell has purposed small group meetings, including gatherings for teens and families who live in I.V. Paola Dela Cruz, board member for the I.V. Recreation and Park District, said these sessions have been a very constructive step up from meetings at other venues.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think we’ve been trying really hard,” she said. “We need a central space that is not just for students, not just paid for by students, but for everyone.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The IVCC is working with The Isla Vista Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) which is currently the only nonprofit servicing I.V. ventures. Together, they plan to launch a capital campaign to raise funding to make up for their current deficit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72545\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72545\" data-attachment-id=\"72545\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/comm-cen-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1328&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1328\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"comm-cen-online-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72545\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1-1024x680.jpg?resize=888%2C590\" alt=\"Courtesy photo\" width=\"888\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">They have broad plans to utilize the space, including several additions that could far surpass their budget. A commercial kitchen, for example, could cost as much as $700,000. Removal of toxic adhesive underneath the current carpeting, a necessary process, will require $40,000.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Flooring options, which may also become a necessity, range from $12,000 to $38,000 based on material, and wood, the most appealing option, is also the most expensive.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The community center received Planning Commission approval for C-2 Zoning on Aug. 31, however, which creates much for flexibility in further plans. The zoning also puts it in the same category as business, professional and trade schools, amusement enterprises, indoor theater and non-residential child care center, among several options.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">IVCC members have ideas to bring yoga, computer literacy classes, music and dance socials, and more to a final community center, set to open in spring 2017. They hope the community center will be open 24 hours a day, but this is still a stretch for a county building that would traditionally have 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. open hours.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Santa Barbara County has not expressed interest in permanently managing the Community Center once it opens next year, but they will support the building in the first month of its operation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Throughout the discussion, debate and redone estimates, the community organizers resoundingly agree on one common factor.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Isla Vista needs a community center.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Weekly meetings will continue until the final opening, with the next meeting held on Thursday at 6 p.m. in the I.V. Clinic Community Resource Room.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 22, 2016, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Update: The latest meeting posting has been added to the article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The plan is still running through several stages of approval.</p>\n<h3 align=\"JUSTIFY\">Faculty Club Construction</h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The faculty club is a reiteration of an earlier faculty residence and conference area, first designed by Charles W. Moore in 1966.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The club, intended to host visitors, will have 34 boutique hotel-style rooms, an enclosed pavilion for meetings, presentations and private parties, two social and event terraces, meeting rooms, a members’ lounge, a bar, a main dining area and a manager’s suite.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Construction will wrap up in early October, according to campus architect Ed Schmittgen. “However, there is a period of time that UCSB needs to work in the building prior to opening to the public,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">They will address items such as orienting staff, training and familiarization with building systems during this period.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72568\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72568\" data-attachment-id=\"72568\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/campus-construction-chugs-along/faculty-club-by-christina-demarzo-print-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Faculty-Club-by-Christina-DeMarzo-PRINT-1.jpg?fit=3000%2C1987&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,1987\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"faculty-club-by-christina-demarzo-print-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Faculty-Club-by-Christina-DeMarzo-PRINT-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Faculty-Club-by-Christina-DeMarzo-PRINT-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72568\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Faculty-Club-by-Christina-DeMarzo-PRINT-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"faculty club construction.

He will serve six months in Santa Barbara County Jail with five years of probation, and he may be deported to his birth country of Japan due to the nature of his conviction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The female UCSB student filed a report against Nakata to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on June 28, 2015, saying she had been sexually assaulted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nakata’s probation report, the assault occurred two days before when the woman had gone to dinner with him and several other friends. She said in the report that she had two to three beers over a period of two hours, and she and her friends then went to Nakata’s house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakata poured shots for the group at his house and gave the woman one to two shots of an “unknown alcoholic beverage,” the report states. She later told law enforcement officials that she blacked out and had difficulty recalling what occurred afterward, but she remembered walking home with the defendant and three other males.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her roommates said in the report that Nakata stayed behind after the three other males left and went to the woman’s room saying that he had left his shoes there. The roommates later forgot he was still in the house and only recalled his presence when another roommate heard two people having sexual intercourse in the woman’s room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The roommates knocked on the locked door when they heard the sounds, the report states, but they did not receive any response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the woman woke up the next morning, she felt pain in her genitals and she found </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her pants in the room with the button and zipper still closed, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to the report. She also stated that the amount of alcohol she consumed should not have caused her to black out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 1, the woman agreed to speak with Nakata on the phone. He apologized multiple times and said they had “hooked up for a little bit” and “it led to sex.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been weighing on me a lot because … you probably were completely blacked out later on and that was absolutely not okay to happen,” he said to her on the phone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakata told her that he realized it was “definitely not okay” when, during intercourse, the woman called him by the name of another friend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 2, 2015, Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office deputies arrested Nakata at his house. He then admitted that “I did keep going for a little more” after she called him the wrong name. When asked if the woman would have engaged in sexual intercourse with him if she was completely sober, Nakata replied, “Honestly, probably no.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In light of that, I probably took advantage of the fact that you were very intoxicated, and that is what I’m very sorry for,” he told the woman during their phone call. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The woman had known him since September 2014 and had never been in a sexual relationship with him. They were both students at the time of the assault, but Nakata dropped out of UCSB after completing his third year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He wrote an apology letter to her after being arrested and his </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">probation evaluation initially recommended a “low term” of three years in prison without probation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the nature and the location of the offense, the defendant should be deemed a danger to young college women reaching their legal age,” the evaluation states.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was granted his final sentencing, however, after prosecutor Von Nguyen negotiated a plea deal with his defense attorney, Catherine Swyson. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said the victim’s family was very involved in the court proceedings and the victim “very much wanted to put this past her.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got to this resolution with her agreement,” Nguyen said. “Ultimately, my goal is to make sure she’s okay.”</span></p>\n<p>“I feel it was a little unfair,” said Nakata when asked about the plea deal, the probation report states. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swysen could not be reached for comment. </span></p>\n<p>Nakata was a member of the lacrosse team at UCSB and worked at software company Cielo24 at the time of his arrest. He was a resident of Northern California before he came to Santa Barbara for college.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has been serving time in the Santa Barbara County Jail since June and has 54 days left on his sentence. After he is released, he will begin federal processing through United States immigration services to determine his residency status in the country.</span></p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former UCSB student Daniel J. Chen was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/former-student-arrested-in-2014-campus-rape-case/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in San Ramon on Feb. 10, 2016 and charged with two counts of rape and is currently being held without bail in the Santa Barbara County Jail awaiting trial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the lawsuit, the UC Regents motioned to strike four specific portions of its text, saying the allegations were not valid enough to carry out legal action.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Donna Geck on June 28 overruled the Regent’s challenge with </span><a href=\"http://www.sbcourts.org/os/tr/tentative-detail.php?RuleID=48964\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for each of the plaintiff’s allegations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among four claims, the Regents said the lawsuit did not explain how the foliage-covered area created a “forseeable risk” for the plaintiff’s injuries. The lawsuit, however, alleges that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the university had “previously received several complaints that crimes had occurred in this area.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are more than sufficient allegations to support the inference that it was foreseeable that a student walking in the area, particularly a female student, might be the victim of a sexual assault or other criminal activity,” the court ruled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents also argued that the plaintiff failed to explain how the area was dangerous and describe how the “dangerous condition” led to the plaintiff’s injuries. The court rejected both of the arguments and the the lawsuit will proceed in its original form. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents had approximately 10 days to respond to the court’s ruling, and the plaintiff and defendant will now begin negotiating whether the case will go to trial or end with a settlement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyrone Maho, an attorney representing the plantiff, said the woman is still hoping for a settlement in the case.</span></p>\n<p>“She wants accountability, not just by the people that did this to her, but for the university to allow this dangerous condition to exist,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attorneys representing both parties will hold the next status conference on Sept. 16.

Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s ongoing construction at the intersection of El Colegio and Storke Roads has sparked concern from many Isla Vistans who believe children, bikers and drivers will not be safe in the major traffic area.</p>\n<p>The crossing is located between Isla Vista Elementary School and the Santa Catalina Residence Hall, whose surrounding areas have been under construction since late last year with the addition of the San Joaquin housing project.</p>\n<p>Pedestrian traffic in the area is mainly comprised of college students and children from Isla Vista Elementary School, and UCSB’s long-range development plan projects that nearly 1,000 college students will occupy the area by 2025.</p>\n<p>To accommodate for the population increase, the university has begun planning a street system with four new protected crosswalks and a single turn lane between I.V. Elementary and Santa Catalina. The crosswalks will include a signal light for drivers and “walking hand” clearance for pedestrians in the 25 mph school zone.</p>\n<p>The new concept replaces one of two existing right-turn lanes onto Storke Road with a “pork chop island,” a raised triangular partition, at the end of a new crosswalk into the Santa Catalina complex.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71833\" style=\"width: 908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"794268775\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71820\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71833\" data-attachment-id=\"71833\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/screen-shot-2016-07-07-at-10-04-06-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?fit=898%2C694&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,694\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-07-07 at 10.04.06 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71833 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?resize=888%2C686\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?resize=768%2C594&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The “pork chop” island, marked (A) will replace the existing second turn lane leading into Storke Road. <em>Courtesy of UCSB</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB will experience a shift in population to the west edge of campus over the next five years, and along with a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BICYCLE-CIRCULATION-@-STORKE-EL-COLEGIO-RD.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new bike path </a>that wraps around the San Joaquin apartments, the university has chosen the crosswalk plan to create easy access between the two sides of El Colegio and Storke Roads.</p>\n<p>“It’s a safety issue for students and staff who will be going back and forth between the two areas,” said Marc Fisher, vice chancellor for administration, speaking to an audience of about 60 Isla Vista and Goleta residents at a town hall meeting in I.V. Elementary on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Residents of Isla Vista, however, are concerned that the single turn lane and island will create traffic buildup in the area during rush hour, finals week, move-in and move-out weekends and graduation.</p>\n<p>“There’s so much for them to figure out, and they’re so little,” said the mother of an eight-year-old child who attends the I.V. Elementary. “It’s overwhelming. Just to think about my child crossing all these areas … I don’t think he’ll be able to do this kind of stuff.”</p>\n<p>One meeting attendee insisted that the current plan furthered “the college interest and not the elementary school interest,” and another suggested that the most logical, long-term solution to benefit the community was a pedestrian bridge.</p>\n<p>“What has happened to those cones [at the intersection] will happen to our children,” said Felipe Garcia, a 20-year resident of I.V. “Every single one of those cones has been hit.”</p>\n<p>According to Derek Rapp, a Stantec engineer who is overseeing the construction, the company considered children when drawing up their plans, and the crosswalk will work to improve an already low statistic of four accidents at the intersection in the past five years.</p>\n<p>If the proposed changes come to fruition, I.V. Elementary will potentially need two more crossing guards, and several students who live at Santa Catalina and San Joaquin will be directed to park at Lot 50, Lot 30 and Lot 38 to decongest the intersection.</p>\n<p>Fisher also said that the university will place a “de-emphasis on cars and a strong emphasis on bicycle and bus circulation” as over 3,000 beds are added to Santa Catalina and San Joaquin housing over the next year.</p>\n<p>The university is paying for construction and design of the new project and Santa Barbara County has the authority to approve all necessary permits. The construction is projected to be complete by the start of the I.V. Elementary school year on Aug. 23.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to get this up and operational for this fall, so it needs to keep moving,” Fisher said. “Personally, I feel this is going to be far safer than the current condition.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71820\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71820\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/","id":3901,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3900,3899,3898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Class of 2016 Looks to Life After Graduation","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thing.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thing.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As UC Santa Barbara’s graduating class prepares to walk the line next week, nearly 5,000 students are looking to the future for life after college.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Next week, almost 5,000 students will graduate from UC Santa Barbara.</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_71622\" style=\"width: 988px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71622\" data-attachment-id=\"71622\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2.png?fit=1131%2C724&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1131,724\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2.png?fit=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2.png?fit=888%2C569&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-71622\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/us-map-vector-dromibi-top-clip-art-2-1024x656.png?resize=888%2C569\" alt=\"Students from the College of Creative Studies are headed around the country after graduating UC Santa Barbara.

Now, another presidential election has taken young people by the reins, and graduating students are facing the future with contrasting college experiences.</p>\n<p>The four-year graduation rate for UCSB students typically fluctuates around 68 percent, according to the UCSB Campus Profile, and 4,687 students are scheduled to attend commencement ceremonies on June 11 and 12, according to Cathy Pollock, assistant dean of the College of Letters and Science.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_8fb6d586-3953-4c78-a23c-032c7a0f6c57\" title=\"\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?B8C\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create pie charts</a></div>\n<p>While the majority of graduating students are seniors, this number includes students from other class levels who will be graduating early, as well as students who graduated prior to Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>Although students from the College of Letters &amp; Science are able to attend whichever commencement ceremony they choose, the largest group of students is scheduled to graduate with the social sciences division, numbering over 2,000 students. UCSB’s largest undergraduate departments are physical and biological sciences at 31 percent, followed by social and cultural studies at 14 percent.</p>\n<p>The College of Creative Studies (CCS), UCSB’s smallest college, will be graduating approximately 90 students next week. Maintaining CCS’s standard of “A Graduate School for Undergraduates,” nearly half of CCS seniors will head to graduate school next year. Approximately 20 percent of the remaining students plan to pursue graduate education in the following year, and 17 percent are headed straight to their prospective careers.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_fba0f287-85f9-47b4-a02c-ceebd29991ee\" title=\"\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?2Dp\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am\" target=\"_blank\">Create your own infographics</a></div>\n<p>CCS students will be attending schools across the country including Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Duke and Berklee College of Music, according to Sara Sterphone, student affairs officer for CCS. A little over 2 percent of students will continue research at UCSB, and other students will attend in-state programs at Chapman, Stanford, UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>When the current senior class enrolled as freshmen, 44 percent of applicants were admitted to UCSB and 18,977 undergraduates populated the university. The school has since grown to accommodate 20,607 undergraduates, and UCSB accepted 32.7 percent of applicants in 2015.</p>\n<p>Along with rising numbers, UCSB’s demographics have undergone significant shifts since 2012. In fall 2015, UCSB was named a Hispanic Serving Institution due to its significant enrollment of students who identify as Chicano/a and Latino/a. Reflecting the criteria for this title, this demographic now represents 27 percent of the undergraduate population as opposed to 24 percent four years ago.</p>\n<p>To offset reduced funding from the state, UCSB has also shifted its enrollment of in-state students along with the rest of the University of California. In fall 2012, 94 percent of UCSB students were California residents and the remainder were out-of-state or international residents. In-state enrollment percentages have gone down by 4 percent as of 2015, and 6 percent of students are now enrolled from outside of California. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These changes have sparked controversy throughout the state and students and legislators are pushing the UC to prioritize residents of California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC, although disputed, will continue to change, and as seniors look back on their education, they will remember varying bits of the institutions that placed them in adulthood. For now, they scramble to complete the last of their exams and face the next few months with confusion, excitement and an ever-critical outlook. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/ucsb-class-of-2016-looks-to-life-after-graduation/","id":2463,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2462,2461,2460],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Interfraternity Council Did Not Bribe Voters, Committee Says","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After investigating  bribery allegations against the Interfraternity Council (IFC), a UC Santa Barbara committee says it has found no evidence of wrongdoing.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_70463\" style=\"width: 988px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70463\" data-attachment-id=\"70463\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-s-students-address-bribery-allegations-made-against-ifc/brendan-gonzalez-speaks-to-as-senate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1345&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1345\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brendan Gonzalez speaks to AS Senate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C597&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-70463\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IFC-SENATE-MEETING-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-ONLINE-1-1024x689.jpg?resize=888%2C597\" alt=\"Inter-Fraternity Council president and UCSB second-year student Brendan Gonzalez listens to questions asked by AS off-campus senator Akshaya Natarajan during public comment during the AS Senate meeting at the Corwin Pavilion on Wednesday, April 27, 2016.

Senate meeting at the Corwin Pavilion on Wednesday, April 27, 2016. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After investigating bribery allegations against the Interfraternity Council (IFC), a UC Santa Barbara committee says it has found no evidence of wrongdoing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One week after the Associate Students (A.S.) announced spring election results in April, the A.S. Elections Board </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-26/a-s-elections-board-calls-for-re-vote-due-to-alleged-bribery-by-inter-fraternity-council/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alleged</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the IFC “bribed” its chapters by awarding philanthropic grants to those that achieved the highest voter turnout. The A.S. Senate called upon UC Santa Barbara Audit and Advisory Services to investigate the allegations.</span></p>\n<p>The committee found that the grants were “intended as more of a contest among IFC member fraternities” than a bribe, Robert Tarsia, directory of audit and advisory services, said in a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Investigation-Report-re-Spring-Elections-Preliminary-Findings-052616.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to A.S. Executive Director Marcela Marquez, on May 26.</p>\n<p>Because the grants did not encourage voting for specific candidates and measures and were intended to be awarded to fraternity chapters instead of individuals, Tarsia says, the committee found no evidence of bribery.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 6, the A.S. Elections Board issued a public <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ALetterfromtheA.S.ElectionsBoard.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">apology</a> to the IFC. Although it stands by its decision to bring the issue to the public, the board said its allegation of bribery was “the wrong word to use and a bold accusation to make.” </span></p>\n<p>“We are genuinely sorry for any damage we did to the reputations of any organizations or fellow students,” the board states in its apology. “The intention of our letter was not to vilify any student or group, but rather to inform the student body of our concerns.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board also apologized to Gonzalez, saying that it “unintentionally hurt a fellow student” while pursuing its goal of ensuring a fair election process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every member of Elections Board knows how difficult it is to be a student, so we apologize for the added pressure, scrutiny and unwanted attention our accusation has brought Brendan,” the board states. </span></p>\n<p>According to its letter, the audit and advisory committee came to its conclusion after interviewing several parties, including the student who initially brought the complaint to the elections board, as well as IFC Council Advisor Miles Ashlock and IFC President Brendan Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>Ashlock, who is also the assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, told the committee that he approved the original grant program, based on his understanding that all money would be used for “charitable activities.”</p>\n<p>The letter says participation in the program was voluntary, and “participation thresholds” would determine the amount of grant money awarded, between $200 and $400 for the winning chapter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Nonetheless, I am very disappointed in A.S. Elections Board and A.S. staff members for allowing these false accusations to be circulated to the campus community.”</p>\n<p>— Brendan Gonzalez</p></blockquote>\n<p>The IFC intended to distribute the grants after the election, but Gonzalez said they have currently suspended the program in light of the ongoing investigation. If further results continue to prove that the IFC grants were not bribes, however, Gonzalez said the program will likely continue as planned.</p>\n<p>The committee also interviewed Marquez, the A.S Elections Board and other members of the A.S. staff, according to the letter, and Tarsia notes that the committee researched the spring election through campus newspaper articles and social media posts.</p>\n<p>As it continues the investigation, the committee will determine whether the IFC’s intended grants resulted in “serious voting irregularity as a result of undue influence on student voting.” It will also research if the grants violated the A.S. Elections Code, Campus Elections Commission Guidelines or Campus Regulations.</p>\n<p>The committee says in the letter that the A.S Elections Board was acting in an “unprecedented” situation and acknowledges that its request for an investigation was “a prudent one.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez initially responded to the bribery allegations in a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/statement-from-inter-fraternity-council-president-regarding-allegations-of-bribery-in-a-s-elections/\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April, saying that “The IFC has been unequivocally transparent about these grants.” In an email Wednesday, he said he was glad the preliminary findings confirmed what he has  “known and repeated from the start.”</span></p>\n<p>“Nonetheless, I am very disappointed in A.S. Elections Board and A.S. staff members for allowing these false accusations to be circulated to the campus community,” Gonzalez, a second-year political science major, said in an email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the A.S. Senate is no longer in session, outgoing A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal, who shared Tarsia’s report in an email Wednesday, said further matters regarding the investigation will be directed by the Villarreal Election Commission. The Senate </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/bills-approved-for-timely-bribery-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approved</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the commission last Wednesday, and Villarreal is currently in the process of appointing 10 members to sit on the board. There is “no known timeline” for the Audit and Advisory Committee’s investigation, Villarreal said last week.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p>[Update June 6: This article has been updated to include an apology statement from the A.S.

all campus services on June 16, affecting access cards, class rosters and faculty interactions with students.</p>\n<p>Celestino Jones, a second-year music composition major, came out as transgender during the beginning of his second year at UCSB. “I’ve been stopped at the dining commons before because I don’t look like a ‘Celeste,’” Jones said, after undergoing hormone therapy that changed his appearance.</p>\n<p>He now has the opportunity to purchase a new access card with his preferred name without having to legally change his documentation.</p>\n<p>“It grew out of the desire to support transgender students specifically, because there are many transgender students whose legal name is not consistent with their identity,” Leesa Beck, the university registrar, said. She also hopes the efforts will improve academic experiences for international students who may use alternate names.</p>\n<p>Students are currently able to change their name through Identity Services or by submitting a petition to the registrar. Certain programs, such as G.O.L.D., source data directly from the registrar’s office, but many organizations such as GauchoSpace interact with numerous other databases like Identity Services.</p>\n<p>Beginning in the summer, the registrar’s office hopes to streamline all name change requests by communicating their information to as many “data feeds” as possible.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Identities are static, sometimes someone goes by one name for a part of their life and they have a shift.” — Dave Whitman</p></blockquote>\n<p>“We think we have caught most of the major ones, but there are literally hundreds around the campus, so we may continue to find ones that we have missed, and have to make updates after we go live,” Beck said.</p>\n<p>Departments that require legal verification, such as the financial aid office, Student Health and Counseling &amp; Psychological Services, are the only groups that will receive both the legal name and the preferred name for each student. Staff members at these locations will be directed to use preferred names when addressing students and legal names when submitting and verifying claims, Beck said.</p>\n<p>The new system will only allow students to change first names, requiring legal documentation to change last names. Although this leaves room for falsification, Beck said she has spoken with schools who use preferred names and found that students “almost never abuse the system.”</p>\n<p>“It would be like putting a weird fake name on LinkedIn or something. No one wants that to be the name their professors are calling them by,” she said. “So for now there will be no “policing” of the names entered. If it becomes a problem down the line, we will reassess.”</p>\n<p>The registrar’s office will be working with the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to publicize and implement the changes after Spring Quarter grades are finalized.</p>\n<p>Dave Whitman, the director of the RCSGD, said “a lot of people take names and pronouns for granted” because they never feel misrepresented by their legal name.</p>\n<p>“Identities are static, sometimes someone goes by one name for a part of their life and they have a shift,” he said. “We just want students to feel like there are services in place that validate the experiences that they are having.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a very rough patch of time telling everyone what your new name and pronouns are and why they’re that way.” — Celestino Jones</p></blockquote>\n<p>When beginning previous quarters at UCSB, Jones said he would sometimes find himself staying quiet during roll call, waiting until the end of class to correct his teachers about his name. He is “grateful” that professors and teaching assistants will only have access to his preferred name next year, and said several other students will benefit as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very rough patch of time telling everyone what your new name and pronouns are and why they’re that way,” he said. “It can alleviate a lot of stress, I suppose, if the name that you prefer is the name that everyone calls you by.”</p>\n<p>Although the new system will be implemented throughout UCSB in the fall, Jones, who is a chair for the RCGSD transgender taskforce, said it will not be a “fix-all” for transgender inclusivity. He explained that faculty members can learn about gender identity and make students feel safe by asking them about their preferred pronouns.</p>\n<p>“I know that even though I told people my preferred name, there were still some folks who made the mistakes of using the wrong pronouns,” Jones said. “It’s all about being educated!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, May 26, 2016, edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71452\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71452\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-to-begin-using-students-preferred-names/","id":2460,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2459,2458,2457],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/91"}},"__N_SSG":true}
