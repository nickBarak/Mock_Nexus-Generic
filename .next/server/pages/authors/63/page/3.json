With just four games remaining in the regular season, the Gauchos play UC Davis today and No. 20 Cal Poly on Saturday, leading both teams by just a point for first place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Two straight losses on the road has set Santa Barbara back to a record of 9-5-1 overall and 4-2 in the conference. Meanwhile, Davis enters today’s game at Harder Stadium at 7-6-2 overall, 3-1-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“Our season does in effect come down to this week,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Last week is done, but we can’t forget why we lost both games. I’m excited that our guys are going to show up tomorrow and play really hard against a team that’s been playing really well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After starting conference play a perfect 4-0, the Gauchos crashed back down to Earth with a rough 5-2 loss at Sacramento St. last Wednesday. Playing at rival Cal Poly just three days later, UCSB was unable to hold on late, falling 3-2 in double overtime.</p>\n<p>“The Big West conference is not kind. You have to play well in every game,” Vom Steeg said. ”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, they will get a shot to play both teams again, this time on their home field. UCSB has once again had its fair share of success playing under the lights of Harder Stadium, owning a 5-1 mark at home this season.</p>\n<p>Getting back on the winning track may just have to do with the play of junior forward Nick DePuy. With seven game-winners this year, DePuy has more than any player in the nation. His 12 scores overall is tied for second.</p>\n<p>The 6-4 Irvine native had scored in five consecutive games prior to last week’s two-game road trip, and it seems to be no coincidence that when his streak ended, so did his team’s. In games where DePuy has scored over the last two seasons, UCSB has gone an undefeated 15-0-3.</p>\n<p>Giving support on the Gauchos’ offensive front is a wide combination of attacking options that includes three dangerous lefties.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani ranks second in the Big West in shots with 43, behind only DePuy. The pressure he has applied to back lines this year tells much more than his three goal, two assist stat line will.</p>\n<p>A leading candidate for Big West Freshman of the Year in Geoffrey Acheampong has been the Gauchos’ best creator all season. To go along with his three goals, the forward’s seven assists ranks first in the conference and seventh in the nation. He has recorded a point in eight of UCSB’s last ten games, accumulating a record of 7-2-1 when he has scored or assisted this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ last two outings also saw the return of junior left back Ismaila Jome from an ankle sprain that kept him out for nearly eight full games. Proving that he’s back and ready to make an impact heading into the postseason, Jome put away a goal in each of last week’s losses – his first two scores of the season.</p>\n<p>With most of the starting lineup ready to go at this point, the pressure falls on UCSB’s defense to get the job done as it tries to secure a No. 1 seed. The Gauchos have conceded 11 goals in their six conference games this season, just one less than last-ranked Sac St. and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“To be 14, 15 games into the season and dominating games, but then giving up excellent scoring opportunities, it’s a recipe for disaster,” Vom Steeg said. “The way we’re going to bounce back is with a renewed commitment to defending. Not just our defenders, but some of our forwards coming down. We need to go back from giving up eight goals last week to giving up none, or one.”</p>\n<p>For the Aggies, defense has not been as much of an issue, giving up just six through six Big West games. They own the conference’s longest active unbeaten streak at four games, all of which went into overtime.</p>\n<p>Senior defender/midfielder Lucas Mohageg has scored seven goals this season to lead the offense, tied for second in the conference. More recently, redshirt freshman defender Roy Boateng has given solid production, recording a brace in a 3-2 win over Cal Poly last Wednesday and picking up the assist on Davis’s lone goal against Sac St. on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s focus tonight will be solely on getting a win, but win or lose, that focus will quickly shift to Saturday’s game with Cal Poly. The Mustangs are also in action tonight, playing Sac St. at home as they look to surpass both UCSB and Davis in the standings.</p>\n<p>“Every year it comes down to something like this,” Vom Steeg said. “When you’re the team that gets the bullseye like we do, we have to rise to that challenge every time we play. The players know what’s at stake and I believe they are committed to give us the effort that we need.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Aggies are set for kickoff tonight at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65639\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65639\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/","id":1483,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1482,1481,1480],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Second Straight in Front of Near-Record Crowd at No. 20 Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is now in a tight race for the No. 1 seed in the Big West North after losing its second straight game.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65525\" style=\"width: 317px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"91945414\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65557\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65525\" data-attachment-id=\"65525\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/kevin-feucht-battles-the-ball-away-from-a-defender-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Kevin Feucht battles the ball away from a defender.

They entered the game at Cal Poly coming off a disappointing 5-2 loss to Sacramento State, but that motivation wasn’t enough to get them the win in a hostile Mustang environment.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As this matchup always seems to do, the game between the Blue-Green rivals lived up to the billing. An action-filled 103 minutes of entertainment in front of the 12th largest regular season crowd in NCAA history found the opposing sides deadlocked at two goals apiece before Mustang junior defender Kody Wakasa ended it in the second period of extra time.</p>\n<p>UCSB had just lost junior midfielder Josue Espana to his second yellow card before conceding a corner for the fifth time in the game. Having just come in off the bench, Cal Poly junior defender Jack O’Connor sent in a cross towards the near post that found Wakasa, who was able to flick in a shot towards the far post.</p>\n<p>The goal, which was the first of Wakasa’s career, could not have come at a better time, as it now puts Cal Poly tied with UC Davis just one point behind UCSB to challenge for the No. 1 seed in the North.</p>\n<p>Prior to the final shot, the Gauchos had more than doubled Cal Poly’s shot production at 23-11. However, the Mustangs had been on target all night, putting 8-12 shots on frame compared to just 9-23 for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in just the seventh minute, as UCSB junior left back Ismaila Jome scored for the second straight game coming off an ankle sprain. Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht, who has been playing well lately, found Jome at the top of the box. The left-footed winger showed why he’s been considered one of the most dangerous players in the conference over the past three seasons, curling a shot into the top right corner to put the Gauchos up 1-0.</p>\n<p>The assist also gave Feucht a point for the third consecutive outing after he scored a goal in each of UCSB’s previous two games.</p>\n<p>It took less than four minutes for the Mustangs to respond, as junior forward Justin Dhillon worked his way into the UCSB penalty area before passing to junior defender Ruben Duran, who put in the early equalizer.</p>\n<p>A frenetic first half continued as Cal Poly’s Kip Colvey fired a shot in off freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg in the 30th minute to give his team its first lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The scoring wasn’t done yet, as right before the 39th minute, a corner by UCSB freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong created a scramble in the box. Junior midfielder Seo-In Kim capitalized on the loose ball to score his first goal of the season, tying it at 2-2.</p>\n<p>Acheampong’s assist gave him seven on the year, two more than any other player in the conference. Having recorded a point in eight of the Gauchos’ last 10 games, Acheampong is a leading candidate for Big West Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game also marked the second straight time that UCSB junior forward Nick DePuy did not score. Prior to the game at Sac St., he had notched a goal in five consecutive games, all Gaucho wins. Against Cal Poly, DePuy nearly scored with a shot off the post in the 36th minute, but wasn’t able to put away any of his five shots on the night.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s success this season may very well depend on whether or not it sees DePuy back in the scoring column this week. In games that the former midfielder has scored in, UCSB is a near-perfect 15-0-3. With the Gauchos hosting two crucial home games this week against both Davis (Wednesday) and Cal Poly (Saturday), their hopes of clinching the No. 1 seed and home field advantage throughout the Big West Tournament for the third consecutive year could be determined in the next five days.</p>\n<p>The game on Saturday drew an astounding crowd of 11,075 people. Since 1980, the Blue-Green Rivalry between the two teams has drawn 12 of the 18 largest crowds in men’s soccer. The two teams could add to that number this upcoming Saturday. When UCSB hosted Cal Poly last year, it drew the second-largest crowd in history.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game will be played this Wednesday at home against UC Davis as they look to find some separation in the Big West standings.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/","id":1476,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1475,1474,1473],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sacked at Sac St., Face Cal Poly Next","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/soccer-3-of-11-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/soccer-3-of-11-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Suffering its first loss of the season, UCSB will travel to face Cal Poly in a hostile environment this Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Five was the magic number for the UCSB men’s soccer team coming into yesterday’s road matchup at Sacramento St., as it looked to win its fifth straight game to open conference play.

The Hornets had played eight of their first 10 games on the road, getting them off to a 3-6-1 start. However, they entered their home matchup with the Gauchos with a solid 2-1-1 record at Hornet Field.</p>\n<p>After a strong first half effort by the Hornets sent them into the break with a 2-0 lead over UCSB, the Gauchos came out strong in the second stanza. Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht scored for the second consecutive game in the 47th minute, putting in a rebound to cut the lead in half.</p>\n<p>In the 64th minute, Sac St.’s Ivan Ramirez extended the Hornets’ lead off a Gaucho turnover. The junior midfielder led a breakaway before dribbling around UCSB freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to finish into the open net, making it 3-1.</p>\n<p>Just 20 minutes later, the Hornets ended any hope of a late comeback with another goal from junior defender Preston Davis.</p>\n<p>It took only 34 seconds for junior left back Ismaila Jome to answer back for UCSB. Playing in his first game since suffering an ankle injury nearly a month ago, Jome capitalized on a Sac St. turnover before firing a shot over the keeper, giving him his first goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Already on their way to defeat, the Gauchos conceded yet another goal in the 88th, with Sac St.’s junior defender Argenis Ramos scoring another rebound goal for his team.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Brad Bumgarner has led the Hornets all season on the offensive side and he didn’t disappoint in the first half. After picking up an assist on teammate senior forward Isaac Flores’ goal to open the scoring in the 24th minute, Bumgarner scored one of his own in the 34th, giving him a team-leading five goals on the season.</p>\n<p>Despite outshooting the Hornets 19-17 on the night, Vom Steeg was only able to make two saves on the night as his record as a starter fell to 9-3. UCSB had not conceded more than two goals all season prior to yesterday’s game.</p>\n<p>Last night also marked the end of forward Nick DePuy’s run of five consecutive games scoring. The junior still leads the Big West in goals by a wide margin with 12 on the year, five more than any other player. UCSB is a near perfect 15-0-3 when DePuy scores.</p>\n<p>Picking up an assist on the Gauchos’ first goal against Sac St. gave freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong six on the year, also the most in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now shift its focus to Saturday’s matchup with Cal Poly, the No. 27 ranked team in the RPI rankings as of October 12.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly has scored only 16 goals this season, just one more than the conference’s worst goal scoring teams, but has found success thanks to its stifling defense.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have gotten off to a 2-1-1 start in conference, allowing just 0.95 goals per game, good for second best in the Big West. Senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton has led the way with a 0.95 goals against average, the second best mark in the conference. As a team, Cal Poly has five shutouts this season, tied with Cal State Fullerton for a number one ranking.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played, UCSB came away with a huge 2-0 win on the road. This will be the first of two Blue-Green matchups that will take place in the span of seven days, as Cal Poly will come to play at Harder Stadium next Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of October 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/","id":1478,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1477,1476,1475],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Game Win Streak On the Line at Sac St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos have gone a perfect 4-0 to start Big West play.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65268\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1895733115\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65306\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65268\" data-attachment-id=\"65268\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/msoccer_vsakron-20150925-dustinharris-5-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"While dribbling down the field, Duncan Backus looks for an open teammate.

The Sac. State game is one that we must win.”</p>\n<p>As a team that looks primed to head into the postseason with a No. 1 seed for the third-straight season, Santa Barbara’s success over the past year has been directly related to the contributions of forward Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>In games that the junior has scored, UCSB is a near unstoppable 15-0-3. Since moving to forward from the midfield in 2014, DePuy has scored 21 goals in 26 games, the most in the nation during that stretch.</p>\n<p>Recently, DePuy’s production has been as consistent as ever. He has a Big West-leading 12 goals and has scored in five consecutive games, all UCSB wins, notching the game-winner in four straight games.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s work on the field has earned him three straight Big West Offensive Player of the Week awards, making him the first to ever do so. Now totaling five in his career, he has moved into a tie for third all-time in the Big West.</p>\n<p>All this consistent success has put DePuy in the national spotlight. With three goals and two game-winners on the road in the conference’s opening weekend, the Irvine native earned his second career National Player of the Week award. With seven game-winners this season, he has two more than anyone else in the country.</p>\n<p>While DePuy has done all he can for his team, a couple of first-year Gaucho forwards in freshman Geoffrey Acheampong and sophomore Ahinga Selemani have given UCSB the much-needed support in the attacking third that it lacked last season.</p>\n<p>“I like to always be on the field, I like to always help the team, I like to contribute, and that’s what I’ve done,” Acheampong said. “That’s what I’ve done all my life and that’s what I look to do at UCSB. I do what I can with my talent to beat my man or find Nick in the box, and he’s kind of hard to miss.”</p>\n<p>Acheampong’s success has also correlated with the team’s success, as he has scored or assisted in six of the Gauchos’ last eight games. He is currently tied for first in the Big West with five assists, and UCSB has a record of 7-0-2 when the Cate School graduate has recorded a point.</p>\n<p>Another left-footed attacker in Selemani is tied with Acheampong with three goals for second-best on the team to go along with two assists. The transfer from Michigan has put the pressure on defenses all season, ranking fourth in the conference with 36 shots.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to make sure that we use all of our bodies, make sure that everybody’s fresh,” Selemani said. “You could tell the last couple games we’ve been getting tired. I think it’s important that everybody’s ready and focused because anyone can be called upon the next couple games to give good minutes and get us a win.”</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB has tallied 27 goals for the year, averaging over two per game and nearly matching its 2014 total of 30. Dating back to last season, Santa Barbara has won seven straight conference games and is undefeated in nine straight.</p>\n<p>“We have to go in with the mentality as the alpha team and go in and dominate,” Acheampong said. “We go in with the mentality that we have to have those games. When it’s clear that that’s the goal of the team and that is what everybody’s coming in to do, it makes it a lot easier.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg has gotten off to a great start to his NCAA career with a record of 9-2. His goals against average of 0.89 ranks second in the conference, while his .787 save percentage is the third-best mark.</p>\n<p>Sac. State doesn’t possess nearly the same kind of firepower as its North Division counterpart, scoring just 15 on the season, one more than last-ranked Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>While the Hornets enter tomorrow’s game well under .500, their record isn’t necessarily an accurate representation of how good a team they are. A rough schedule to open the season saw them play eight of their first 10 games on the road. When playing at home, they are a much better team, going 2-1-1 in four outings.</p>\n<p>Sac. State’s only conference win came at home in a 3-2 victory over UC Irvine. Sophomore goalkeeper James Del Curto recorded 14 saves in that game, the most of any player in Division I soccer this season. He ranks second in the Big West with an average of 4.5 saves per game, a stat which could be inflated due to a defense that has allowed the second-most goas in the conference at 1.7 per game.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, redshirt freshman forward Brad Bumgarner leads the way with four goals. A balanced attack has seen five other Hornets score two goals.</p>\n<p>Twenty-seven-year Head Coach Michael Linenberger earned Big West Coach of the Year honors in 2014 as Sac. State qualified for the Big West Tournament for the first time since joining the conference four years ago.</p>\n<p>The game is set to kickoff at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow at Hornet Soccer Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65306\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65306\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/","id":1477,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1476,1475,1474],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Another Winner From DePuy Keeps Perfect Conf.

Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It took two overtimes, but the No. 13 UCSB men’s soccer team continued its perfect start to conference play with a 2-1 win over Cal State Fullerton at home this past Saturday. For the fourth straight game, junior forward Nick DePuy was the hero, scoring his nation-leading seventh game-winner of the season.</p>\n<p>With their fourth straight win to open conference and fifth overall, the Gauchos are now 9-3-1 overall and 4-0 in Big West. Fullerton was handed its first loss in conference play and falls to 7-5-1 overall and 2-1-1 Big West.</p>\n<p>In a defensive stalemate of a match, the Titans’ Julian Okai opened the scoring in the 77th minute. A long throw into the box from defender Zach Bryan took a deflection and fell to Okai about 10 yards away from goal. The senior midfielder volleyed it home for his first goal of the season, seemingly sending the Gauchos to their first home conference loss in their last 12 at Harder Stadium.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, it took less than a minute before DePuy was taken down in the box, earning the Gauchos a penalty kick. Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht stepped up to fire a shot into the bottom left corner, tying it at 1-1. Feucht’s first ever Division I goal was also his first since playing for the University of Charleston last year, where he tallied seven as a freshman.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first overtime in which the Gauchos were outshot 3-1, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong hooked up with DePuy for UCSB’s decisive goal. Acheampong ended a nice run up the left wing before coming to a stop and sending a ball into the box. As he seems to do at least once every game, DePuy found space coming through the box and finished with a strong header, providing UCSB with yet another thrilling clutch moment.</p>\n<p>The goal sent UCSB to its seventh straight conference win dating back to last year and gave DePuy his 12th score in 13 games this season, tied for second in the nation. The Gauchos’ record in games where the junior scores improved to a virtually perfect mark of 15-0-3.</p>\n<p>In his 26 games as a forward, DePuy has scored 21 goals, another nation-leading stat during that stretch. Also having scored the game-winning goal against UCR on Thursday, DePuy earned his third consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Week, becoming the first player to ever accomplish the feat. With five weekly awards in his career, he is tied for third all-time in the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was able to come away with a win despite recording only four shots on goal through 103 minutes, its lowest mark in a win since tallying just two in a 1-0 season-opening victory over No. 11 Stanford. Freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg recorded four saves on the night, giving him a 9-2 record as a starter.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Acheampong picked up a point for the sixth time in the Gauchos’ last eight games. Similar to DePuy, the left-footed freshman’s statistical contributions have been a predictor of the team’s success. When Acheampong has scored or assisted this season, UCSB has gone an undefeated 7-0-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB will head back on the road this Wednesday for a game against Sacramento State as it looks to maintain its unbeaten conference record.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65260\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65260\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/another-winner-from-depuy-keeps-perfect-conf-start-alive-for-no-13-ucsb/","id":1501,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1500,1499,1498],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vom Steeg Becomes First to Reach 100 Big West Wins After UCR Shutout","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CamerynBrock-soccer-4-of-11-for20151008-web-e1444367766871.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CamerynBrock-soccer-4-of-11-for20151008-web-e1444367766871.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Nick DePuy records his nation-leading sixth game-winner as the Gauchos defeat UCR.

Santa Barbara’s third consecutive win to open up conference play gives Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg 100 Big West wins in his career, making him the first ever coach to reach that milestone.</p>\n<p>“I told the team tonight we had an opportunity to go take a picture in front of the scoreboard and put it up on a wall somewhere,” Vom Steeg said. “That’s not just Tim Vom Steeg’s 100 wins, but it’s UCSB’s 100 wins.”</p>\n<p>Now winners in six of their last seven games, the Gauchos improve to 8-3-1 overall and a perfect 3-0 in conference. The Highlanders are now 5-6-1 overall and 1-2 in Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I thought that Riverside was one of the more dangerous teams that we’ll play all season long,” Vom Steeg said. “Credit to the players, I thought we made a real concerted effort to get a shutout tonight.”</p>\n<p>There wasn’t much to be excited about through the first 70 minutes of play, but that suddenly changed as the Gauchos were able to find the breakthrough off a left-footed strike by forward Nick DePuy. The goal was DePuy’s fifth in four games and his sixth game-winner of the season — the most of any player in the nation.</p>\n<p>“As the game goes on, you want to have Nick on your team,” Vom Steeg said. “At some point, all season long, he’s found the net.”</p>\n<p>The unstoppable junior now has a conference-best 11 goals on the season, already surpassing his total of 10 from last year. Since moving out of the midfield to forward midway through last season, DePuy has 20 goals in the Gauchos’ last 25 games, making him the country’s top goal scorer during that stretch.</p>\n<p>“I just make sure every chance I get I put on target,” DePuy said. “I’m learning each game and trying to get better each day. It takes a lot of practice and repetition, but I’ve been working hard and hopefully I can keep scoring.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played at Riverside in 2014, UCSB was just barely able to hold on to an ugly 1-1 tie despite playing with nine men down the stretch. Playing under the bright lights of Harder Stadium this time around, it looked like things would be different as UCSB came out firing, recording the first seven shots of the game.</p>\n<p>Good scoring chances were scarce, but the Gauchos found their first about 20 minutes in. After some well-worked passing, the ball came loose deep in the box where sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani and DePuy both had chances to open the scoring.</p>\n<p>Selemani couldn’t make contact with his twisting effort, but the ball fell to DePuy’s feet right at the edge of the six-yard box. After a quick turn to aim toward the goal, DePuy was unable to get hold of the ball and sailed the shot high.</p>\n<p>Riverside wasn’t able to record a shot until the 21st minute, but the momentum seemed to switch from there as the Highlanders forced UCSB freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make three saves over a ten-minute stretch.</p>\n<p>DePuy had another good scoring chance to open the second half after a nice 1-2 combination with freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong, but UCR’s senior goalkeeper Ashkan Khosravi kept it scoreless with a diving save.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were finally able to open the scoring in the 70th minute. Quickly capitalizing on a turnover in play on his offensive half, DePuy found himself with enough space to get off a shot with his weaker left foot, slotting it past the keeper and inside the right post.</p>\n<p>“I was just thinking, ‘Take the guy on,'” DePuy said. “We had a chance in the first half and I kind of rushed it and hit it wide. I really wanted to just get my touch out in front of me, hit it low and hard, and that’s what I did.”</p>\n<p>With the game not yet decided, a moment of brilliance from Acheampong less than eight minutes later put the game away for UCSB. Attacking down the left wing, the Cate School graduate cleanly split a pair of UCR defenders in the box with a nifty, controlled dribble.</p>\n<p>A third defender rushed forward from the middle of the box, but the crafty freshman slipped by to set himself up on his favored left foot. Despite a difficult angle, Acheampong put his rocket left foot to work, blasting a shot past the keeper and inside the far post, clinching the 2-0 win.</p>\n<p>“Geoffrey was a handful on the outside for them,” Vom Steeg said. “In that situation, a double team, Geoffrey’s still going to look to play inbetween two and break through. He broke in with the idea of getting the shot off, hitting it hard and keeping it down, and it got us the second goal.”</p>\n<p>Acheampong is now tied with Selemani for second on the team with three goals to go along with his team-best four assists.</p>\n<p>“Effectively, that second goal was the game,” Vom Steeg said. “[Riverside is] a team that relies on one mistake and one shot. The minute that scores goes 2-0, now it’s going to take two shots. At that point, you can see their team just dropped off.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outshot Riverside 16-9 on the night, including seven shots from DePuy. The Gauchos earned their second shutout in their last eight games.</p>\n<p>With the win, Vom Steeg became the first coach in Big West history to reach the 100-win milestone. He now has a career record of 226-95-38 through 17 years as UCSB’s head coach, including a 100-28-17 record in conference games.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos is a home matchup with Cal State Fullerton on Saturday as they look to continue their hot start in conference play. The Titans are the only other Big West team that has gone undefeated in conference play thus far, going 2-0-1.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care particularly much for Fullerton. Last year we went down there and absolutely got manhandled in that game,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ll absolutely be ready to play on Saturday. We’re going to compete we’re going to hit, score some goals, and we’re going to defend. Shutout number two, that will be the mission for the team.”</p>\n<p>The game with Fullerton will kickoff at 7 p.m. on Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65151\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65151\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/","id":1510,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1509,1508,1507],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Round-Up Week 4: Cream of the Crop","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/footballdude.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/footballdude.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sports Editor Michael Jorgenson ranks the NFL's current undefeated teams amongst each other.

When you have Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, though, you’re great no matter what year it is.<br>\nAll the fuss about Deflategate hasn’t slowed New England down one bit, and the Tom Brady Revenge Tour is in full effect. The old man is third in QB rating, first in yards per game and has his team leading the NFL in point differential (49). Did I mention he’s a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl MVP and four-time champ that shows no Peyton Manning-like signs of slowing down?<br>\nThe receiving corps of Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola has gotten the job done, while solid production from shifty running back Dion Lewis has kept the Patriots offense in full throttle.

They have some issues to work out on defense, but we’ll have to wait and see if they can separate themselves from the Panthers in the only division that has two 4-0 teams.<br>\nLuckily for Atlanta, they have one of the easiest remaining schedules in the league, meaning they have a great shot at challenging Green Bay for the No. 1 seed in the NFC.</p>\n<p><strong>#5 Denver Broncos</strong><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"110977107\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65101\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64688\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/broncos/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=1280%2C744&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,744\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Broncos\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=888%2C516&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-64688\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=157%2C91\" alt=\"Broncos\" width=\"157\" height=\"91\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><br>\nIf there’s one piece of advice 39-year-old Peyton Manning would give to Tom Brady right now, it’s this: Enjoy being 38. The decline of Mr. NFL Record Book has been excruciatingly noticeable this year yet, somehow, the Broncos are 4-0.<br>\nDenver’s defense has saved it on more than one occasion, but Peyton has gotten the job done when he’s needed to, most notably in a comeback win over the Chiefs in which he threw the game-tying touchdown with little time remaining.<br>\nStill, Peyton currently ranks 30th in the league in quarterback rating at 80.8, completing just 63.6 percent of passes while throwing a pick in all four games.<br>\nThe running game hasn’t done much to help either.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A successful pair of games on the road last weekend has made the UCSB men’s soccer team one of only two teams in the Big West to start a perfect 2-0 in conference play. This weekend, the Gauchos return home to welcome UC Riverside and the only other 2-0 team in Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“It was a great weekend playing what I think are two really tough teams on the road,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “But, as we know, last weekend doesn’t matter if we don’t take care of this weekend. We have to continue doing what we’ve been doing over the past four weeks now and find a way to win conference games.”</p>\n<p>A three-game win streak has brought UCSB’s record to 7-3-1 overall and 2-0 in conference, giving it sole possession of first place in the Big West North. The Highlanders come to town at 5-5-1 overall and 1-1 in the Big West. The Titans, currently at 7-4 overall, 2-0 Big West and in first place in the South, will arrive on Saturday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the Gauchos, every week has seemed to tell the same story for quite some time. The name of that story? Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s offensive front man has so many scoring streaks and statistical anomalies going for him right now, it’s hard to keep track. With a brace in his last game and three goals in the conference’s opening weekend, DePuy earned his second career National Player of the Week award and second consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>“What he’s doing right now is really remarkable,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s been one of the best runs we’ve had out of any forward. One of the huge advantages this year is he’s got players around him that can give him the ball. We have players around him that are dangerous and that can score, so that means [the defense] can’t really concentrate all their energies on one player.”</p>\n<p>The junior has now scored in three consecutive games, giving him a Big West leading total of 10 through just 11 games, which matches his 2014 total. Since moving to forward from the midfield last year, he has compiled 19 goals in 24 games. In UCSB’s 15 wins during that stretch, DePuy has scored 11 game-winners. His total of five game-winners in 2015 has him in the top five in the nation.</p>\n<p>Backing him up on the offensive front has been a pair of first-year Gaucho forwards in sophomore Ahinga Selemani and freshman Geoffrey Acheampong. Selemani has 34 shots to his name this season, good for second in the Big West behind DePuy’s 38 and is second on the team with three goals and eight points. Acheampong is currently tied for first in the conference with four assists to go along with two goals of his own to match Selemani with eight points.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg has been strong in the net for the Gauchos. The freshman ranks fourth in conference with a .99 goals against average that has given him an excellent record of 7-2 through his first nine career starts.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Gauchos are undefeated in their last seven conference games dating back to last season, excluding the postseason. They are off to a 2-0 start for the second consecutive season.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Gauchos nearly missed out on the No. 1 seed after going winless in their first three conference road games, but they pulled together to either win or tie their last five games to clinch home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. With their first two conference wins of 2015 coming on the road, they are in excellent shape to earn a No. 1 seed in the Big West Tournament for the third-straight season.</p>\n<p>UCR travels to Harder Stadium today hoping it can win, or at least repeat the result it managed against the Gauchos last year. Playing on their home turf, the Highlanders frustrated and held UCSB to a 1-1 tie through 120 minutes. Playing at Harder Stadium this time around, Santa Barbara can expect a much different result.</p>\n<p>“If they come out trying to frustrate us, we’ve just got to give it right back to them,” freshman defender Sam Strong said. “We’ve just got to frustrate them more. Those are my type of games, so I’m excited.”</p>\n<p>Riverside possesses the conference’s second-best goal-scorer of the year in Norberto Ochoa. The redshirt senior forward has notched seven scores thus far, helping UCR to a third-best ranking in the Big West with 18 as a team. This is a big improvement compared to last season when the Highlanders managed just 21 all season.</p>\n<p>CSUF comes to town on Saturday coming off a game at Cal Poly tonight. If both the Titans and the Gauchos come away victorious tonight, then Saturday’s match will be a battle between the only two teams in the Big West to start 3-0.</p>\n<p>“What Fullerton has done in each of their games is kind of hung on, frustrated the other team and then found a way to score a goal,” Vom Steeg said. “I don’t think they’re going to come here with any intentions of running up and down the field with us. I think they’re going to try to maintain a good defense, put lots of players behind the ball and see if they can get something on a set piece or a breakout.”</p>\n<p>The Titans are led on offense by sophomore midfielder Diego Sanchez, who has five goals this season, and freshman forward Brandon West who has tallied three assists. Both marks are good for third best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Fullerton has been especially good on the defensive side since the start of September, earning six shutouts in its last nine games. The Titans rank second in the conference in goals against average, allowing just .91 goals per game, compared to UCSB’s third-best mark of 1.15.</p>\n<p>Junior defender Zach Bryan was largely responsible for the team’s great start to conference, leading the defense in last weekend’s 2-0 and 1-0 wins over Sacramento State and UC Davis, respectively. His efforts earned him the first Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors of the conference season and the first of his career.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will still be without junior left back Ismaila Jome, who has missed the last five games with an ankle injury. After trying to play through an injury since spring, junior midfielder Drew Murphy has been ruled out for the season after deciding to have surgery on his ankle.</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to take on UCR at 7 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium before hosting CSUF on Saturday at the same time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/","id":1508,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1507,1506,1505],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"DePuy Powers UCSB to Perfect Big West Start","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB was winless in its first four conference games in 2014.

After the Gauchos defeated UC Irvine 3-1 on Thursday to open up conference play, the scorching hot junior put away both goals in a 2-1 overtime win against CSUN on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Santa Barbara now owns the Big West’s best overall record at 7-3-1 and 2-0 in conference play. The Anteaters ended the weekend with a 1-1 tie against Cal Poly to move to 2-6-3 overall and 0-1-1 in the conference. Northridge lost both of its games over the weekend to fall to 4-5-1 overall and 0-2 in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">While conference road games were a huge issue for the Gauchos in 2014, the boys in blue seem to have found answers with more experience. Dating back to last year, UCSB has now won four straight on the road in the Big West and is undefeated in its last seven conference matches overall, not including the postseason. This is a huge turnaround from the start of conference play last season, when Santa Barbara went winless in its first four games away from home.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">While the Gauchos did much of their damage against Irvine early in the first half, the game against Northridge took nearly 100 minutes of play before DePuy was able to put it away with a walk-off winner. Moments before the goal, DePuy flicked a ball into the box to find junior midfielder Seo-In Kim who was able to cut inside and get a shot off on target.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">As he was for most of the game, Matador senior goalkeeper Adam Hobbs was in position to make the save, sending the ball towards UCSB’s Ahinga Selemani. The sophomore forward’s rebound attempt hit the right post, falling right back to DePuy in the six-yard box where he struck in his fifth game-winning goal of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">It’s been quite a year already for DePuy, who has now scored in three consecutive games. The former midfielder leads the Big West with 10 scores through 11 games, three more than anyone else in the conference. His five game-winners are good for a top-5 ranking in the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Although UCSB dominated in the shot department, outshooting CSUN 18-5, Hobbs’ season-best 10 saves kept the Matadors in the game until late. The only other shot that got past the senior was the game’s opening goal, which DePuy headed past him in the 38<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute thanks to a good cross from junior midfielder Andy Perez. DePuy had seven shots to his name for the day, including six on frame.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The Gauchos seemed to be heading into the half up 1-0, but Northridge’s sophomore forward Dean Wright found an equalizer with just 1:59 left before the break. Redshirt freshman midfielder Bradley Mulvey and sophomore forward Jeremy Degraffenreidt picked up their first career assists after a through ball from Mulvey set up Wright for the game-tying shot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">However, it wasn’t enough for the Matadors, who for the second straight time hosting the Gauchos lost 2-1 due to an overtime game-winner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The win was UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s 99<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> career Big West victory. He needs just one more to become the conference’s first coach ever to reach 100 wins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">In Thursday’s win over the Anteaters, despite conceding less than three minutes into the game, the Gauchos answered back quickly to take control on their way to the 3-1 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">A pretty pass from senior midfielder Gerardo Gonzalez gave senior midfielder Eduardo Calzada the opportunity to chip UCSB freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, putting the Anteaters up 1-0. </span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB answered back quickly, scoring in lucky fashion just seven minutes later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After finding space down the left wing, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong sent in a cross that ended up in the back of the net to tie the game at one goal apiece. </span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Less than two minutes passed before DePuy put away a shot passed Irvine’s redshirt senior goalkeeper Michael Breslin to make it 2-1, thanks to a perfect through ball from sophomore left back Randy Mendoza.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Vom Steeg made four saves on the night, but perhaps none was better than the one he made in the 20<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute on a shot by senior midfielder Mats Bjurman, coming off his line to make a fine stop and conserve the Gauchos’ slim advantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The Gauchos held on to their one-goal lead all the way until the 86<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute, when junior midfielder Josue Espana came up with a takeaway deep in Irvine territory before beating Breslin inside the penalty area. With the 3-1 victory, UCSB has now come away with a win in its last four Big West openers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Through one weekend of conference play, Northridge and Irvine join Sacramento St. as the only winless teams in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB returns home this week for games against UC Riverside on Thursday and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65018\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65018\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/depuy-powers-ucsb-to-perfect-big-west-start/","id":1509,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1508,1507,1506],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFC Championship Bound: Packers & Cardinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cheeseheaddn092815.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cheeseheaddn092815.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Aaron Rodgers is the best quarterback… ever Yeah, I said it.

Bring it on. Read me the NFL record book, aka Peyton Manning’s biography. Make it about jewelry, how the 31-year-old QB has just one ring and miles to go if he’s going to catch Tom Brady or Joe Montana.<br>\nSay he isn’t even the best to put on a Packer uniform. I’m standing by my claim.<br>\nIf you saw Mr. Discount Double Check’s performance against the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday Night Football, then you saw in a nutshell why I think he’s the most complete signal caller of all-time. His stat line of five touchdowns, 24-35 passing, 33 yards and a quarterback rating of 138.5 says a lot, but it doesn’t tell the whole story.<br>\nRodgers is deadly accurate whether he’s standing in the pocket or on the move. He’s so quick and mobile, with feet that never stop hopping, it’s almost impossible to bring him down. Even when there is pressure in his face, he has a lightning quick trigger and a Spidey-sense presence that allows him to throw ridiculous fade-away bullets right into his receiver’s chest.<br>\nIt’s like watching Madden, except in real life. Wait… isn’t that the point of Madden?<br>\nIt can be argued that in this day and age, performances like this happen all the time around the league. Even a rookie like Marcus Mariota can throw for four TDs and no picks in a game. After all, we are currently living in the era of iPhones and inflated passing numbers.<br>\nWith Rodgers though, it’s almost assured that we’re going to see sky-high numerical dominance every single time he steps on the field. That’s why his QB rating of 106.8 is the highest in the history of the NFL and the only one above 100 (Tony Romo and Peyton Manning are distant runner-ups at 97.6 and 97.3, respectively).<br>\nI’m not saying he’s the greatest quarterback ever. That’s obviously a boringly impossible-to-prove statement to make.<br>\nBut in terms of the accuracy, the mobility, the numbers, the consistency and the overall feeling of helplessness that he gives to opposing defenses, I don’t think there’s another quarterback in any situation that I would ever take over him.<br>\nSure, Brady is the ultimate winner. Sure, Peyton is the ultimate robot. And, yes, our parents once watched Dan Marino and Joe Montana and will never change their minds about who the best ever is.<br>\nIn the end, whether he’s on my fantasy team or the team I root for, I’m picking Brett Favre’s patient former backup to lead me to victory, and I don’t think there’s anyone in the NFC that can stop him.</p>\n<p><strong>The Cardinals Are For Real</strong><br>\nAfter Week Three of last year, I put the Arizona Cardinals’ chances of winning the Super Bowl at zero. The reason? Quarterback Carson Palmer had torn his ACL for the second time in his career.<br>\nEven without Palmer in the lineup, the Cardinals proved just how good they were by starting off 9-1 and making the playoffs with third-string quarterback Ryan Lindley heading the offense.<br>\nFast forward to now. Arizona is 3-0 with the most points in the league and the third-fewest points allowed.<br>\nWhat stood out to me most while watching what could be the beginning of the end for Colin Kaepernick in the Cards’ 47-7 demolition of the 49ers on Sunday was just how ruthless Arizona Head Coach Bruce Arians is. Despite going into the half leading 31-7, Arians’ message to his team was simply this: “Step on their throats.”<br>\nThis isn’t to be confused with the message that Sean Payton has for his New Orleans Saints to literally step on their opponents’ throats. This is more in the scoreboard sense. #bountyjokes<br>\nAll humor aside, I don’t know about you, but if I were a six-foot, 230-pound athlete with a super strong frame, lightning speed and physically violent capabilities, then Arians is the kind of guy that I would want to play for. Unfortunately for me, I’m about 60 pounds shy of being that.<br>\nNow I’m not 100 percent sure what goes on behind the scenes with the New England Patriots other than cheating, but I’m guessing Bill Belichick is sending the same kind of message to his players as they put 40 and 50 burgers up on teams, regardless if it’s in the rain or snow. That’s just one of the many reasons why he’s won four Super Bowls.<br>\nRight now, the Cardinals have it all: an excellent coaching staff, a tenacious defense with playmakers all around, an offense that seems to be drinking water from the fountain of youth, not to mention their supply of young studs like Michael Floyd, John Brown and Andre Ellington.<br>\nIf the Cardinals can stay healthy, they are the favorites to make it to the NFC Championship alongside Green Bay. They have the right mindset to do it.<br>\nIf there’s anything that the 2009 runner-up Cardinals, led by old dog Kurt Warner, or the 2007 and 2012 New York Giants have taught us, it’s that it just takes one solid run in January to make it to the greatest show on turf, America style.<br>\nCarson Palmer, just watch your knees and get Larry Fitzgerald that ring already. Twelve seasons in Arizona? The man has suffered through enough.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false;

The Gauchos enter tonight’s match with a 5-3-1 record, which includes statement wins over No. 3 Stanford and on the road at UCLA.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters were a national powerhouse last season, but have not found nearly the same success this time around, starting the year at 2-5-2. The Matadors started slowly in 2015, but won their last three games on the road to improve to 4-3-1 heading into conference play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a team, UCSB has been the best on offense this season, currently leading the Big West with 18 goals through nine games. Junior Nick DePuy has been a model of consistency since moving from the midfield to forward midway through last season, scoring 16 goals in his 22 games up front. He currently leads the Big West with seven goals and was named this week’s Big West Offensive Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong came into the year as a player to watch coming out of Cate School and he has not disappointed. The lefty notched his fourth assist of the year in the Gauchos’ 4-0 win over San Diego this past Sunday, making him the conference’s sole leader in assists.</p>\n<p>Also providing an offensive punch has been sophomore Ahinga Selemani, who transferred from Michigan after his freshman year. The 5-8 forward has already matched his totals from last year with three goals and is currently tied with DePuy and one other player for first in the conference with 28 shots.</p>\n<p>Injuries have begun to wear UCSB down a bit, with several starters being kept out of the lineup in recent games. Juniors Ismaila Jome and Drew Murphy were unavailable to close out the Gauchos’ last four games, while sophomore center back Jeff Quezada suffered an injury in practice that kept him out for last weekend’s games.</p>\n<p>In Quezada’s absence, the defense has looked shaky at times, but a pair of freshmen in defender Sam Strong and goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg have been solid all year. The Gauchos are currently ranked fifth in the conference having allowed 11 goals to opposing teams.</p>\n<p>UCI has struggled to start the year, but it hosts UCSB tonight seemingly having solved its offensive problems which caused it to stumble out of the gates. Through their first seven games, the Anteaters were shutout four times, putting away just three goals total.</p>\n<p>In the past week, however, they have found a rhythm, putting away four scores in a win over LMU on Thursday, followed up by a three goal effort in a 4-3 overtime loss to UCLA.</p>\n<p>The second half could be worrisome for the Gauchos, who have conceded eight of their 11 goals allowed after halftime. This might favor the Anteaters, who have put away all but one of their 10 goals in the second stanza.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Ivan Canales leads the offense in goals and assists with three each.</p>\n<p>The Matadors host Cal Poly tonight and UCSB on Saturday having won three consecutive games on the road. They have dominated the conference awards in recent weeks, with the past two Defensive Player of the Week winners and the Offensive Player of the Week from two weekends ago.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Adam Hobbs took home the most recent defensive honors, stopping a penalty and maintaining a 1-0 shutout against San Diego last Friday. Senior defender and captain Trevor Morley earned the award the week prior, holding Saint Mary’s and Santa Clara to just one goal in 180 minutes while adding two goals of his own on penalties.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, redshirt senior Carlos Gonzalez leads the team with four goals, three of which he scored in 29 minutes off the bench at Saint Mary’s to earn his first ever Offensive Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play at UC Irvine tonight at 7 p.m. and will head to Northridge to take on the Matadors Saturday at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We had high expectations of playing well and we didn’t play well,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The key to Akron was to get wide play, to get service, to get players in the box, and about 25 minutes in we weren’t able to get that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After surviving early offensive pressure from the Gauchos, particularly coming from sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani who had a team-high three shots on the night, the Zips found themselves in a great position picking off a poorly placed back pass in the 35<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg reacted quickly to make a sliding save on Sam Gainford’s first attempt on goal, but the sophomore forward was first to the rebound and he scored easily. UCSB went into the half trailing 1-0, the first time it faced a deficit going into halftime all season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“Our back line was out of sorts, but the reality is we gave them that first goal and that allowed Akron to sit in with seven guys,” Vom Steeg said. “Coaching-wise, it was absolutely frustrating because I didn’t think that we had a lot of options available to us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Things didn’t get much better for the Gauchos from there. Akron was able to pack up on the defensive side for the rest of the game, stifling any half-chances UCSB could conjure up in the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We looked a little tired. We had to chase the game after we went down and Akron was very good at staying in and keeping everybody in front of them,” Vom Steeg said. “Anytime you have to take the game to the other team, you need something to get a goal – something to change the momentum – and we just never got a goal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Still searching for an equalizer in the 87<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute, an unfortunate attempt by the Gauchos to clear the ball from deep in their territory was deflected right to forward Stuart Holthusen. Vom Steeg rushed to meet the sophomore on the right side of the box, but the Akron man was able to place a shot past the keeper’s left and inside the near post to put the game away at 2-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After being shutout for just the first time this season, the Gauchos bounced back strong on Sunday, looking more like the team that won 4-2 at UCLA just one week ago. UCSB was firing on all cylinders, scoring as many goals as San Diego had shot attempts with four.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Freshman defender Sam Strong picked up his second goal of the season just over eight minutes in, capitalizing on a rebound after a header from Selemani was saved wide by USD sophomore goalkeeper Thomas Olsen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The action picked up again in the second half, as UCSB put the game away with a pair of goals separated by just over a minute. Selemani was set up by a great run from freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong, who led a counterattack all the way down the left wing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Acheampong cut it back to find Selemani at the top of the box, where he found space away from his defender and blast a left-footed shot in off the keeper’s gloves at the near post. The first-year Gaucho has proven to be a solid number two attacking option alongside Nick DePuy, notching his third goal of the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Speaking of DePuy, after what has become a rare occasion with the junior failing to find the back of the net on Friday, the 6-4 forward put the game away with a goal in the 60<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">th</span></sup> minute. A Torero turnover gave junior midfielder Josue Espana the opportunity to send in a cross from deep down the left wing. Just as he has been so many times, DePuy was the first to the ball, knocking a shot past Olsen at the far post to make it 3-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">DePuy now has seven goals on the season, two more than anyone else in the Big West. As a team, the Gauchos have been outstanding on offense, scoring an average of two goals per game. Acheampong also leads the conference with four assists, while Espana and junior left back Ismaila Jome, are tied for second with three each.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Making his debut for the Gauchos, freshman forward Jonah Adomakoh came off the bench to add another score, beating Olsen with a well-placed shot on a breakaway down the right side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB outshot San Diego 13-4 on the night, including 8-2 in shots on goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Vom Steeg had a relatively simple night with two saves, a much more relaxed outing compared to Friday when he finished with a career-best seven saves and the Gauchos fell for the first time at home this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Injuries have begun to take a toll on UCSB, with several key starters missing action in recent games. Ankle injuries have kept Jome and junior midfielder Drew Murphy out since UCSB’s game against College of Charleston on September 18, while sophomore center back Jeff Quezada missed this past weekend’s action after being injured in practice. Sophomore defender Fuad Adeniyi has gotten the start at center back during Quezada’s two-game absence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Santa Barbara will head back on the road this weekend to open up conference play against UC Irvine on Thursday and Cal State Northridge on Saturday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

the road this past Monday, UCSB men’s soccer Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg joked that maybe this could be the team to finally win a game at UCLA. Thanks to a second-half scoring outburst, the Gauchos’ pulled away from the Bruins for a 4-2 win and their first-ever road win against their UC counterpart.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to Harder Stadium this weekend for a pair of games against No. 9 Akron on Friday and San Diego on Sunday.</p>\n<p>With its second consecutive win and its first over UCLA since 2011, UCSB improves to 4-2-1 this season. The Bruins have struggled to start the season by their standards, as the loss was their fourth in five games, bringing their record to 2-4.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The winning formula for the Gauchos prior to Monday night’s game had been coming out strong in the first half, scoring first in each of their opening six games. That wasn’t the case this time around, however.<br>\nAfter conceding the opening goal on a penalty to UCLA’s Larry Ndjock 28 minutes in, UCSB answered back with four straight goals, including two from junior forward Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>The reigning Big West Offensive Player of the Year found an equalizer in the 38th minute, scoring off an assist from freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong for the second straight week. After receiving a ball from DePuy down the left wing, Acheampong sent it right back to DePuy through the air, and was able to beat his defender and knock a header off the near post and in.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the half tied 1-1, UCSB took complete control from there, scoring three goals in less than 10 minutes. Sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani gave the Gauchos the lead in the 54th minute, firing it in from the top of the box to make it 2-1.</p>\n<p>Just two and a half minutes later, DePuy scored another header off a corner kick from junior midfielder Josue España, giving him his sixth goal of the season. Soon after, DePuy returned the favor, forcing a turnover on the UCLA half before setting up España for his first goal as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>The Bruins were able to pick up another goal with sophomore forward Seyi Adekoya scoring in garbage time, but they fell well short of mounting a full comeback.</p>\n<p>UCSB had struggled to finish its chances in its last game against the College of Charleston, only scoring three times off a season-high 21 shots. The Gauchos were much more efficient finishing this time around, converting on half of their eight shots on goal to pick up their season-best mark of four goals. It was the first time the Bruins conceded four goals in a regular season game since 2010.</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg improved his starting record to 4-2, tying a career high with four saves on the night.</p>\n<p>The secret to Santa Barbara’s success is no secret at this point. DePuy has a Big West-leading six goals through seven games. Dating back to last season, he has been on an incredible scoring run, tallying 11 scores in his last 13 appearances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to put forth arguably their best effort of the season despite missing injured juniors Drew Murphy and Ismaila Jome, the only two Gauchos on the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team other than DePuy.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is Akron, which enters this weekend boasting a No. 9 national ranking and a record of 4-2-1. The Zips got off to a great start to their season that included back-to-back road wins over No. 25 Georgetown and No. 11 Maryland. Unlike the Gauchos, they have experienced success away from home this season, going 3-1 on the road.</p>\n<p>Powering Akron on the offensive side this season has been redshirt sophomore Sam Gainford and junior midfielder Adam Najem. Both players lead the team with four goals and three assists each and will look to break down a UCSB defense that has conceded just one goal at home this season.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos will face San Diego. The Toreros are currently 4-2-2 after winning 3-1 at Cal State Fullerton and 2-0 against San Jose State last weekend. Senior midfielder Marvin Schmiege has been their key man through eight games, either leading or tying for first on the team in nearly every important offensive category with three goals, two assists, 21 shots and eight shots on goal.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts Akron this Friday at 7:30 p.m. and San Diego on Sunday at 6:00 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page

Junior midfielder Eric Clark’s free kick found sophomore defender Cesar Murillo to tie it at 1-1, marking the first time the Gauchos have conceded a first half goal this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to eliminate making that one big mistake,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re playing with a young back line and I still feel like our communication, our spacing, we’re still prone to make a mistake going up for the same ball, so we just have to keep working on that.”</p>\n<p>After junior left back Ismaila Jome left the game with an ankle injury about 15 minutes in, freshman midfielder Geoffrey Acheampong filled in and was a menace on the offensive side. The former Cate School star led the way with two assists, his first coming with just over 26 minutes left in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We got some good performances from some different players. In particular, I thought [Geoffrey] played his best college game,” Vom Steeg said. “We were planning to bring Geoffrey into [Jome’s] position anyway, but there was no need to actually bring Ish back into that game the way that Geoffrey was playing.”</p>\n<p>With his third corner attempt in under a minute, Acheampong played a ball into a packed six-yard box where junior forward Nick DePuy was able to establish position over his defender and place a header just inside the far post, giving his team a 2-1 lead heading into the half. Santa Barbara has now scored first in each of its six games and taken a lead into halftime in all but one.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s goal was his fourth of the season, tied for first in the Big West, and the eighth game-winner of his career. In the 12 games that DePuy has scored, the Gauchos have gone an undefeated 9-0-3.</p>\n<p>With just under 22 minutes to go in the game, Acheampong played in a low cross that found junior midfielder Andy Perez at the far post where he was able to power a deflected shot in off a defender to seal the 3-1 win.</p>\n<p>“I just saw two guys trying to crash the box and my job was just to get it into the six,” Acheampong said. “It’s kind of a gray area there where the keeper doesn’t really know to stay or come out, so I just put it in between for Nick or Andy to crash it and it just landed at Andy’s foot.”</p>\n<p>UCSB found itself threatening early and often, outshooting Charleston 21-4 on the night. Goalkeeper Kevin Shields was the easy choice for man of the match for the visiting side, as the junior made nine saves to keep the score line respectable.</p>\n<p>“I did feel like our offense really started to come alive today,” Vom Steeg said. “We really wore that team down, so our energy and our running was good.”</p>\n<p>Despite the win, it wasn’t all smiles for the Gauchos. Already missing junior midfielder Drew Murphy to an ankle injury, UCSB now might also be without its starting left back Jome as well against UCLA after he suffered an apparent sprained ankle.</p>\n<p>The game was also delayed for an extended period of time in the first half when Charleston’s Eric Clark needed to be carted off after taking a hard fall while challenging for a header.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now shift their attention to tonight, where they will face a hostile Bruin crowd in a Pac-12 televised game. UCSB most recently fell to UCLA at Harder Stadium 1-0 last season and has not defeated its UC counterpart since 2011, going 0-3-1 since that last win.</p>\n<p>The Bruins enter with a 2-3 record this season, most recently ousting Big West opponent Cal Poly 4-1 on Friday. UCLA’s youth has powered it so far this season with seven of its eight goals coming from its underclassmen. Freshman midfielder Jackson Yueill and sophomore forward Seyi Adekoyi lead the way with two goals each.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is set to kickoff at 7:00 p.m. at Drake Stadium and will be televised on the Pac-12 Networks.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/","id":1498,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1497,1496,1495],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Familiar Start for Men’s Soccer","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M-Soccer-v-Cal-Poly-by-Cameryn-Brock_exported-10.28.2014-3005.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M-Soccer-v-Cal-Poly-by-Cameryn-Brock_exported-10.28.2014-3005.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After its second consecutive 2-2-1 start to the season, the UCSB men's soccer team looks poised to finish with the No. 1 seed in the Big West once again.

Seeing as how the Gauchos went on to finish the 2014 season with the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage throughout the Big West Tournament, this solid start seems to bode well for them. After all, they were selected to repeat as Big West North Division Champions in the 2015 Preseason Coaches Poll.</p>\n<p>Bringing back core players in left back Ismaila Jome, midfielder Drew Murphy and forward Nick DePuy, all of whom are juniors who were named to the Preseason All-Conference Team, UCSB has experience on its side this time around.</p>\n<p>DePuy is the reigning Big West Offensive Player of the Year, having scored 10 goals and six game-winners last season. The former midfielder has already gotten off to a hot start to this season as well, notching three goals in five appearances, tied for first in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Murphy and Jome are coming off a season in which they each compiled a team-high five assists, with the latter having already tallied three assists this season, also tied for first in the conference.</p>\n<p>Kicking off their campaign against national powerhouse Stanford and star junior forward Jordan Morris, who has recently been seeing time playing for the US Men’s National First Team, the Gauchos got off to a perfect start to the season. DePuy was able to pick up right where he left off, scoring a first-half header off a cross from junior midfielder Seo-In Kim.</p>\n<p>A resistant UCSB defense shut down Morris and the Cardinal all night behind the great play of its defense. Fantastic debuts from sophomore holding midfielder Kevin Feucht and a couple of freshmen in center back Sam Strong and goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg provided the Gauchos 90 minutes without a slip-up on the way to a 1-0 statement win over the team that was ranked No. 8 in the nation to start the year.</p>\n<p>Strong’s efforts earned him his first Big West Defensive Player of the Week award while Vom Steeg earned a call-up to play for the USMNT U-20 squad in Serbia the following weekend. The team’s top goalkeeper and son of Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has given the defense a comfortable, composed presence in goal, providing two shutouts and going 2-1 in his first three starts. His .800 save percent and 0.67 goals against average are both good for third in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ first road trip to New Mexico saw them tying 2-2 against Denver before falling 2-1 to host team No. 17 New Mexico. UCSB’s top two transfers in Feucht and sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani were named to the All-Tournament team, continuing to impress and solidify their spot in the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>Just this past weekend, Santa Barbara traveled to UConn where it bounced back with a 2-0 win over Yale before once again losing to the host team 2-1.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have tended to start games strong, scoring a goal in the first half of four out of their five games, they have conversely found themselves faltering late in games. Already three times this season, they have conceded two goals after halftime to lose their lead.</p>\n<p>Up next for UCSB is a home game against the College of Charleston, a team the Gauchos defeated on its home turf last season 2-1. The game will be played at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow night at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This article appeared on page 12 of September 17, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64663\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64663\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/msoc/","id":1504,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1503,1502,1501],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":13,"route":"/authors/63"}},"__N_SSG":true}
