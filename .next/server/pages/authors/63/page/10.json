Santa Barbara’s only other first-half goal came from sophomore utility Samantha Murphy on a power play, but the five-goal deficit at halftime was too much for her team to handle.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to get back in the game, the Gauchos looked to sophomore utility Jessie Porter to lead the way. Porter scored three consecutive goals in the fourth quarter, while her defense played better than it had played all game, allowing just one LMU goal in the final period.</p>\n<p>Despite the spirited comeback attempt, though, UCSB fell short with a final score of 10-7.</p>\n<p>In their next match against Marist College later in the day, the Gauchos took advantage of their opponent defensively, shutting the Red Foxes out in the opening period.</p>\n<p>UCSB took a 1-0 advantage off an early goal by sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson, but lost its lead after a Marist goal early in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>After conceding their first goal of the game, the Gauchos finished out the half with one of their strongest performances in any quarter this season.</p>\n<p>Freshman attacker Taylor Shore scored her second goal of the day to put UCSB back up 2-1, and her teammates took over from there.</p>\n<p>Goals by freshman attackers Jenna Solberg and Carly Christian extended the Gauchos’ lead to three goals, and sophomore utility Holly Smith added another to make it 5-1 going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Hudson made her mark in the second half by adding three more goals to her tally, giving her a total of four in the game.</p>\n<p>Goals by freshman attacker Brenna Thomas and senior utility Jade Wentz Fitzgerald sealed the deal for UCSB as it cruised to a 10-4 victory.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos split two tightly contested matches against two fellow top-20 ranked teams. Against UC Davis, UCSB fell just short by a final score of 6-5, but it answered back by taking down San Diego State in overtime, 7-6.</p>\n<p>The win against San Diego was the Gauchos’ first against a top-20 team this year, bringing their record in those games to 1-7.</p>\n<p>After taking next week off, UCSB will be back on the road for the UCI Invite, which begins Feb. 22 at the Anteater Aquatics Complex.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of Feb. 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-goes-2-2-at-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-goes-2-2-at-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-goes-2-2-at-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-goes-2-2-at-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-goes-2-2-at-ucsd-triton-invite/","id":5087,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5086,5085,5084],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 18 UCSB Faces No. 11 LMU in First Round of UCSD Triton Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.CMS-2_Vadenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.CMS-2_Vadenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No.8 UCSB women’s water polo team will try to win its first game against a top 20 team.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This weekend, the No. 18 UCSB women’s water polo team goes on the road to take on No. 11 LMU in the UCSD Triton Invite.

We have room for improvement and it’s just the beginning.”</p>\n<p>Already at 0-5 against top-20 teams, UCSB will look to end this streak with a win over LMU. The Lions are off to an impressive 3-1 start, already having picked up a 12-7 win over No. 8 San Jose State in the UCLA Invite two weeks ago. Their only loss came against the No. 3 ranked Bruins with a final score of 15-6.</p>\n<p>LMU possesses one of the most powerful offensive machines in the country, already averaging an impressive mark of nearly 16 goals per game in wins. Senior attacker Alexandra Honny is averaging a team high 2.75 goals per game, while four of her teammates are averaging 1.75 or more per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re not really doing anything specific just because we’re playing LMU; we’re just going to play our game and see what we can do,” Martin said. “We’re working on our 6-on-5 as well as our 5-on-6 defense, and making sure that everything is flowing together.”</p>\n<p>Early in the season, the young Gaucho squad has been led by Martin, who has 11 goals through seven games.

After the Bears got out to a quick 4-0 lead after the first quarter, sophomore utility Samantha Murphy scored the Gauchos’ first goal of the game to cut the lead to three. However, the Bears answered back with four more consecutive goals heading into halftime.</p>\n<p>Going into the third quarter with a large deficit, sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson gave the Gauchos their second goal of the match. Cal answered with three goals of its own, taking a dominant 11-2 lead into the final period. Junior utility Lauren Martin was one of the few bright spots for UCSB during the game, scoring two goals in the fourth quarter, but the Gauchos were outplayed once again and finally fell 14-4.</p>\n<p>Playing No. 5 Arizona State early on Saturday, Santa Barbara came out strong with Martin scoring the game’s opening goal. The Sun Devils answered with three goals of their own, but freshman attacker Carly Christian scored two straight before the end of the first period, making it a one-goal deficit at 4-3 heading into the second.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos again started the second quarter strong as Hudson scored first to tie it at four goals apiece, but Arizona State began to pull away with another three consecutive scores heading into the half.</p>\n<p>In the second half, UCSB found goals from freshman attacker Jenna Solberg and Murphy, but the team was unable to pull off the comeback and lost 11-6 for its second-straight loss.</p>\n<p>Against No. 8 San Jose State Friday afternoon, the Gauchos’ offense got off to a slow start. UCSB was shutout in the first quarter but its strong defense kept them in the game by giving up only one goal.</p>\n<p>Just after the second quarter began, Hudson tied the game at 1-1. As they did multiple times over the weekend, though, the Gauchos gave up three consecutive goals to the Spartans and went into the half trailing 4-1.</p>\n<p>To have any shot at coming back, UCSB needed a big second half, and it got one. Martin scored two goals, including one coming off of a set, and Christian added another to give the Gauchos three in the quarter and head into the fourth trailing 6-4.</p>\n<p>In a tightly contested fourth quarter, UCSB took the game down to the wire. Hudson scored her second goal, and Martin scored two more to bring her total to four on the day. Still trailing 8-7, Christian tied the game.</p>\n<p>However, with just 1:11 remaining, San Jose State was able to beat sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw and come away with a 9-8 victory. Brokaw ended the game with eight saves.</p>\n<p>In their first game of the season, the Gauchos were brought down to earth quickly as they gave up a goal just 15 seconds into the match. Sophomore utility Jessie Porter answered back to tie it at one and Christian scored her first career goal to give her team the lead.</p>\n<p>Before the end of the half, Christian contributed her second goal of the match while sophomore utility Michelle Dunn and freshman utility Megan Linder also scored to give UCSB a 5-3 lead at the half. In the third, Martin scored once more to make it 6-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to hold on in a low-scoring fourth quarter, ending the game with a 7-6 win and their first of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB gets next weekend off before heading on the road for the UCSD Triton Invite on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/","id":5086,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5085,5084,5083],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Preview: Long Beach State Men’s Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Long Beach State finished with the best regular season conference record last season and will look to do the same again this year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Long Beach State men’s basketball team will look to defend its Big West regular season title this year after finishing with a narrow one-game lead over Pacific last season.

The Toreros, whose overall record of 24-3 was good enough to earn them the No. 9 seed in the tournament, defeated Santa Barbara, 3-0, back on Sep. 14.</p>\n<p>“I was kind of shocked after finding out we were playing them because I thought we were going to have a better seed in the bracket,” senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “But I was also super excited because they were the last team that swept us, so that definitely left an imprint on our brains. All we want to do now is go out and get some revenge on them.”</p>\n<p>After enduring a tough preseason, UCSB found something special right at the perfect time. The Gauchos went 13-2 over their final 15 matches, ending the season with a record at 18-10 overall and 13-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With its impressive regular season now concluded, UCSB’s outstanding play over the course of the season was acknowledged this past week with a remarkable five players named to the All-Big West teams.</p>\n<p>“I could not have asked for my teammates to play any better [this season],” Thompson said. “Every game, every practice they stepped up and took the challenge that we had in front of us and killed it.”</p>\n<p>Senior libero Leah Sully, who became UCSB’s all-time digs leader last weekend, was named to the All-Big West First Team along with Thompson and sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau. Freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt, who was named the Big West Freshman of the Year, also earned a spot on the First Team, and freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt was given an All-Big West Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>“For us to have so much representation on the All-Big West team was certainly something that shows how far we’ve come this year,” Lantagne Welch said. “Our results, obviously being tri-champions, and just having such a balanced team really showed in the All-Conference results.”</p>\n<p>Although USD dominated UCSB in the teams’ previous matchup, the Gauchos believe that they are a different team this time around.</p>\n<p>“Beating No. 5 Hawaii pretty much gave us the confidence to feel like we can take anyone down, so we’re not afraid,” Spindt said. “I don’t think they know what we’re [capable of].”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has had great success against ranked teams this year, not only with its upset over Hawaii but also with two victories over the previously-No. 24 ranked Northridge. However, the Gauchos will need to be sharp in every aspect in order to come away with another upset.</p>\n<p>“[San Diego is] an excellent defensive team and their floor defense is what really shines,” Lantagne Welch said. “The biggest key for us is serving tough, and in addition we need to be sharp offensively and take advantage defensively when we get them out of system.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be looking to the trio of Thompson, Spindt and Barbeau to carry them on the offensive end. Thompson’s 3.25 kills per set average was good enough for third best in the Big West this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also look to its defensive trio of Sully, Grunt and freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg to try and slow down the fast paced Toreros offense. Sully finished the year with the most digs in the Big West despite only starting the last 16 matches at libero, while Grunt and Sullberg finished in first and third in blocks per set, respectively.</p>\n<p>“They run a very quick offense and they are very heavy with their middle and right side attack,” Lantagne Welch said. “That’s their bread and butter, so we need to be able to slow that down by serving tough, blocking well, and playing good defense.”</p>\n<p>San Diego’s fierce offense is powered by one of the most balanced attacks in the nation with five players averaging 2.67 or more kills per set. Senior middle hitters Chloe Ferrari and Katie Hoekman lead the way for their team with incredible hitting percentages of .435 and .383, respectively. Ferrari will be the main emphasis for the Gauchos’ defense, as she was voted the 2013 WCC Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to approach it as any other game, but we’re super focused,” Spindt said. “Obviously we’re going to be extra pumped since we’re playing on such a big stage and we have this great opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos owe much of their success this year to Lantagne Welch, whose efforts in her first season as the team’s head coach earned her a Big West Co-Coach of the Year Award. After five trips to the NCAA tournament while coaching the University of Miami, her experience will surely be a boost for a young roster which, with the exception of Sully, has never played an NCAA tournament match.</p>\n<p>“She pushed us and influenced us in such positive ways,” Thompson said. Without her, I don’t think we could’ve made it to the NCAAs.”</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s match is scheduled at 7:30 p.m. at Jenny Craig Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/","id":5286,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5285,5284,5283],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sweep Pair of Weekend Opponents","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/volleyball1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/volleyball1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is now just two wins away from a Big West championship.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With just one weekend left to play this season, the UCSB women’s volleyball team is two wins away from winning its first Big West title since 2004.

Leading 15-14 in the first set, the Gauchos went on an 8-0 run to pull away, led by senior opposite Katey Thompson.

UCSB kept the pressure on, hitting at a remarkable .583 clip in the set, and a final kill by Villanueva gave the Gauchos a 25-13 win and 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“Our focus sharpened up a little [in the second set],” Lantagne Welch said. “We were able to [come up with] some ideas where we could score more effectively. We became a little more deceptive with our setting and our hitters started to get into a groove.”</p>\n<p>The third and final set was more of the same as a second 8-0 run put UCSB up 15-5. Thompson hit the final kill in front of home fans, giving the Gauchos a 25-15 victory and a sweep. This was the last career home game for Thompson as well as for senior liberos Kara Sherrard and Leah Sully.</p>\n<p>“It’s surreal; I don’t think it’s hit any of us yet,” Sully said. “I’m just glad that we had a good team effort tonight and we could pull out a win.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s match against Fullerton, the Gauchos had one of their most efficient nights offensively, hitting at a .303 clip. After winning a tough first set 25-22, UCSB came out to dominate the second set, 25-18.</p>\n<p>Fullerton tried to extend the match, but a 16-15 lead in the third set. The Gauchos reeled off seven straight points, including three straight service aces by Sherrard, and eventually won the set 25-21 on a Thompson kill.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces Long Beach on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 25, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53252\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53252\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/gauchos-sweep-pair-of-weekend-opponents/","id":5293,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5292,5291,5290],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Ready to Clinch Big West Championship at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895777259-O.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895777259-O.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos Host Cal State Fullerton, UC Riverside","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With just four matches to go in the regular season, the UCSB women’s volleyball team is in as good a position as any team to win the Big West.

Freshman outside hitter and sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau back Thompson up with solid averages of 2.73 and 2.52, respectively.</p>\n<p>This weekend, the Gauchos play their final homestand of the year against the two teams at the bottom of the standings, a favorable matchup for a team that can almost taste the finish line.</p>\n<p>“We’re all super excited; we want to win the Big West so bad,” freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt said. “We’re just going to keep doing what we’ve been doing, working hard in practice, and I think we’re going to pull it out.”</p>\n<p>The match against Fullerton begins at 7 p.m. on Friday at home, and the match with Riverside will also be set to begn at 7 p.m. on Saturday in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53143\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53143\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-ready-to-clinch-big-west-championship-at-home/","id":5282,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5281,5280,5279],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Cinderella Story","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895776639-O.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895776639-O.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's historic run has catapulted the Gauchos from mediocrity to the top of the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>What makes sports so fun to follow? As fans, we try to write the scripts of our favorite sports even before any games are played. We always think we know what’s coming — which team will end up in first place and which one is doomed to a season of insignificance — yet we keep watching. We do this because we know that on any given day, an underdog can win a game that they weren’t supposed to. The script is constantly being flipped, and we are reminded that every statistic we see on paper is thrown out the window the second the two teams step onto the playing field. We don’t want to miss out on the teams making those amazing runs, those improbable upsets that no one could have seen coming. This season, the UCSB women’s volleyball team just happens to be one of those teams.</p>\n<p>After the Big West Preseason Coaches Poll predicted the Gauchos to finish in sixth place out of nine in the conference, expectations weren’t exactly sky high. New coaches, new players and a conference dominated by Hawaii, the No. 11 ranked team in the nation — not the ideal formula for a season with championship aspirations. For whatever reason, though, this team of scrappy Gauchos has done the improbable this season. They are currently second in the Big West at 10-2, trailing only the 12-2 Matadors of Cal State Northridge. With just four matches left and a tiebreaker over Northridge, UCSB has its destiny in its own hands; win out, and they’re the champs. But how did this happen?</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons I took the program is because I knew we could have success, challenge for Big West championships and make the NCAA’s,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “However, back in February when I took over, I did not think that we would be challenging [this season], and that’s just a testament and credit to the team.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Twelve games into the year, the Gauchos didn’t look like the team that they knew they could be.

As a result, UCSB stumbled to a disappointing 3-2 loss, but the injury would prove to be a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>“That was the first match we moved Leah to libero and so we had a brand-new lineup and only a day or two to practice with it,” Lantagne Welch said. “We really got into a rhythm after that and were able to really produce. People were really comfortable in their roles and really started to excel from that point on.”</p>\n<p>With Sully now playing libero, other positions began to open up for the younger players on the team. Sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau’s production skyrocketed thanks to the absence of Sully on the outside, and Spindt established herself as a nightly threat for a double-double. The Gauchos also received consistent contributions from freshmen middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg, who have remarkably risen to first and fourth, respectively, in blocks per set in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard for any freshman to come into a starting role, there’s a lot of adjustments to be made,” Sully said. “But they did a really great job at taking on their roles and when they play well other people play well, so that helps the team a lot.”</p>\n<p>With the role players in place, Sully continuing to anchor the middle at libero, and senior opposite Katey Thompson performing at a high level as the team’s top hitter, the Gauchos were ready to make a run, and they did just that.</p>\n<p>Following the loss to Long Beach State, UCSB took down UC Irvine in straight sets and a hot Cal Poly team, 3-1. Next up was the most difficult road test of the season: Hawaii. The Rainbow Wahine had risen to No. 3 in the nation at the time and had been undefeated in the Big West since they entered it last season, but the girls from Santa Barbara came in ready for a fight. After five grueling sets, the Gauchos came away with one of their biggest and most exciting wins in the team’s recent history, reminding everyone, including themselves, that anything was possible.</p>\n<p>“I think the team really believed that we could play with anybody,” Lantagne Welch said. “The combination of the older players believing in the new players, and everyone just being ready to go after it was a big point in that victory.”</p>\n<p>From then, things became almost too easy. UCSB defeated the Big West’s top team for the second straight week in Cal State Northridge, 3-0. The next day, it showed its resilience in a comeback victory over a tough UC Davis squad. In the Gauchos’ next three road matches, they failed to drop even one set, sweeping UC Riverside, Cal State Fullerton and Cal Poly as they prepared for the season’s final stretch of matches.</p>\n<p>“One of the best things is we had such balance,” Lantagne Welch said. “One match it would be a Katey Thompson, another match it would be an Ali Spindt, then it was Ali Barbeau and Leah Sully’s passing and defense. There isn’t one particular player, and I think that’s the reflection of our success because there have been so many contributions.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s historic winning-streak of eight straight matches, its longest since 2005, came to a close in a tough loss to Hawaii a couple of weeks ago, but the Gauchos have since bounced back with wins over Davis and first-place Northridge. The Gauchos haven’t made it to the NCAA tournament since 2009, and they haven’t won the conference since 2004, but for whatever reason, this is the year that it might happen.</p>\n<p>With all the unexpected ups and downs a season has to offer, it is difficult to predict how any team’s year will go. Sometimes, like in the case of the 2013 UCSB women’s volleyball team, everything just comes together the right way at the right time. Now, just four more wins is all it will take to complete what has been a storybook season. Four more wins, and these underdog Gauchos are Big West champs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 20, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/ucsbs-cinderella-story/","id":3241,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3240,3239,3238],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Beat CSUN, Now Sit in First Place in the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/volleyball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/volleyball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB swept the season series against Northridge.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last Saturday, the UCSB women’s volleyball team played what was then its biggest match of the season against No. 12 Hawaii, coming up just short in a 3-2 loss. Exactly seven days later, the Gauchos took on first-place Cal State Northridge in a match with even bigger implications in deciding the Big West championship race. UCSB did something that it couldn’t do against Hawaii, prevailing with a thrilling 3-2 win and putting itself in the best position of any team to win the conference.</p>\n<p>The latest win gives UCSB a record of 15-9 overall and 10-2 in the Big West while dropping Northridge to 22-5 and 12-2. After completing the season sweep over the Matadors, the Gauchos earned the all important tie-breaker, which will give them first place if the two teams end the year with the same record. On Thursday, a 3-0 UCSB victory over UC Davis dropped the Aggies to 14-12 overall and 6-7 in conference.</p>\n<p>“It felt awesome. Winning any five-set game is really a great feeling,” freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt said. “We were just hungry to win and we knew we had to pull it out.

UCSB pulled away with five straight points, taking a 20-13 lead thanks to the serving of senior opposite Katey Thompson.</p>\n<p>“We had confidence knowing we could beat them because we’ve been there before,” Spindt said. “We never underestimate any team so we just came out how we did the first time we played them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went on to win the set 25-18, but the Matadors responded well in the second, winning it 29-27.</p>\n<p>After splitting the next two sets, with UCSB winning the third 25-20 and Northridge taking the fourth 25-21, the fifth set began promisingly for the Gauchos. With the score at 14-12, the final point provided a fitting end to the match as Thompson took a pass from senior libero Leah Sully and finished it off for her 15th kill of the night.</p>\n<p>“We stayed mentally tough and we had a lot of energy and fight,” Spindt said. “We grinded it out for every single point and we knew it was going to be a battle.

The loss snapped an eight game winning streak, handing the Gauchos their first loss since late September.</p>\n<p>Up first for UCSB is Davis, a team that the Gauchos barely defeated 3-2 in a home match last month. The Aggies are one of only three teams in the conference to have upset Hawaii this year, and they have played well behind a strong offense this season.</p>\n<p>Leading the way are senior opposite Devon Damelio and junior middle blocker Victoria Lee. Damelio averages a team-high 3.08 kills per set while Lee leads the entire conference with a .406 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“UC Davis is a very good team and they play excellent defense,” Lantagne Welch said. “We need to be very patient and determined in finding ways to score against them.”</p>\n<p>In the match that could likely decide which team wins the Big West this year, UCSB takes on the second-best offense in the conference in the Matadors on Saturday. The Gauchos are sure to come in with confidence since they beat Northridge 3-0 back in October, holding the Matadors to a measly .170 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“Their offense and their setter really create things for them and they’re a very good blocking team,” Lantagne Welch said. “We had a pretty balanced offense against them last time and our defense was able to keep them below their averages.”</p>\n<p>The Matador’s junior libero Kelcie Randazzo averages 3.71 digs per set, good for fifth best in the conference. Northridge’s offense is extremely balanced with no players averaging over three kills per set and four averaging over 2.5. Setter Sydney Gedryn is third in the Big West averaging 10.39 assists per set.</p>\n<p>The emergence of middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg on the defense has been huge for UCSB as the season has progressed. The two freshmen are first and fourth in the Big West with averages of 1.22 and 1.11 blocks per set, respectively.</p>\n<p>With senior Leah Sully continuing to start at libero and averaging a fourth best 3.79 digs per set, the defense should not have to worry too much about facing two strong offenses this week.</p>\n<p>The match against UC Davis begins at 7 p.m. on Thursday, while the match against Northridge will be played at 7 p.m. Saturday and will be viewable on ESPN3.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52956\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-season-on-the-line-with-two-matches-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52956\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-season-on-the-line-with-two-matches-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-season-on-the-line-with-two-matches-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-season-on-the-line-with-two-matches-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-season-on-the-line-with-two-matches-this-weekend/","id":5284,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5283,5282,5281],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Hawaii as Win Streak Snapped","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895776916-O.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WomensVBvsHawaii_EricSwenson_1-2895776916-O.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB loses to Hawaii 3-2; eight game win streak napped","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team came into this past weekend with loads of confidence, despite the fact that they were playing the No. 12 team in the nation in Hawaii.

The Rainbow Wahine had been undefeated in conference since entering the Big West last season, and a scrappy Gauchos’ squad appeared to be no threat to the dominant team that was ranked No. 3 in the nation.</p>\n<p>Now, less than a month later, UCSB is near the top of the Big West, sitting just a half game back from Cal State Northridge for first place. At 13-8 overall and 8-1 in conference, the Gauchos have turned it on lately. They are going for their ninth-straight win this weekend against No. 3 Hawaii, who they beat earlier this season by a score of 3-2 in one of the most thrilling matches they have played in years.</p>\n<p>After the loss to UCSB, the Rainbow Wahine stumbled further by losing two straight Big West matches on the road a week later. Now, the once unstoppable and unanimous choice to win the conference finds itself dreadfully sitting in third place with a record of 18-4 overall and 7-3 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s going to be a really tough match but we’re looking forward to it,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “They’re going to be coming in really fired up because we broke their streak and beat them in their place, so we know we’re going to get their best game.”</p>\n<p>Possessing one of the best offenses in the nation, Hawaii leads the conference in every important offensive stat including kills, kill percentage, assists per set and points per set.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to be ready for them and play at a really high level,” Lantagne Welch said. “We’re really looking forward to that challenge and having the opportunity to play in front of our home crowd and hopefully a great environment.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way for the Rainbow Wahine as always is senior outside hitter Emily Hartong, who leads the Big West with 4.65 kills per set. Setting her up is senior setter Mita Uiato, who is first in the conference averaging 10.88 assists per set.</p>\n<p>“They are a good hitting team,” senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “We need to make sure we serve them tough so they won’t be able to execute their offense.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ counter for Hartong is Thompson, who averages a second-best 3.49 kills per set. The last time these two teams met, she played one of her best games this season with a team-high 19 kills and an astounding 10 block assists.</p>\n<p>While UCSB has been picking up the wins, they have not done so with any kind of remarkable offensive stats. Staying disciplined may be the number one reason why the Gauchos are 8-1 in the conference as they have accumulated the lowest amount of errors in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB finds its strength in its defense, which held Hartong and the entire Hawaii offense to just a .111 hitting percentage in October. Freshman Phoebe Grunt has quickly found her place as one of the best middle blockers in the conference, averaging a Big West leading 1.17 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>“Our confidence is definitely higher than the first time we played them,” Thompson said. “At the same time we need to make sure we have the same determination in order to win.”</p>\n<p>Anchoring the middle at libero for the Gauchos is the invaluable senior Leah Sully, who has now risen to fourth in the Big West with 3.69 digs per set. If the Gauchos fall behind, Sully may be asked to play her more favored position of outside hitter as she did in a come-from-behind win against UC Davis several weeks ago.</p>\n<p>However, the Rainbow Wahine may have the advantage in the form of senior libero Ali Longo, who leads the Big West with 332 digs this season.</p>\n<p>The match will be played Saturday at 6:30 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em></em>Daily Nexus <em>File Photo.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52863\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52863\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/gauchos-host-no-12-hawaii-in-battle-of-big-west-contenders/","id":5283,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5282,5281,5280],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sweeps Rival Cal Poly for Eighth Straight Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Womens-Volleyball_Peter-Vandenbelt_5D3_5426.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Womens-Volleyball_Peter-Vandenbelt_5D3_5426.jpg?resize=457%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is red hot with eight straight victories.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It’s becoming almost too easy for the UCSB women’s volleyball team, which defeated Cal Poly 3-0 this past weekend to improve its winning streak to eight matches.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have now won their last 11 sets to help them improve to a 13-8 overall, 8-1 conference record, and are on their longest win-streak since 2005.

Off a pass from sophomore setter Hanna Nielson, Thompson picked up her eighth and final kill to seal the Gauchos’ third straight sweep.</p>\n<p>The UCSB defense saw three players record five block assists, and was once again led in the middle by Grunt who had two solo blocks of her own. Senior Leah Sully made the start at libero for the ninth straight match, recording a team-high 14 digs.</p>\n<p>“Leah’s an incredible libero for us. We’ve played really well as a team when she’s in that role,” Lantagne Welch said. “Spindt and Barbeau have really picked up their game as the season’s gone on, and we’re getting a lot of kills from our pins.”</p>\n<p>Barbeau led the team in kills for the second straight match with 16, going for a .289 hitting percentage on the night, while Spindt added 7 kills and 13 digs of her own.</p>\n<p>Despite the streak, the Gauchos still find themselves one win back from Cal State Northridge (19-4, 9-1) in the standings.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home for a 6:30 p.m. match against Hawaii on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 4, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-sweeps-rival-cal-poly-for-eighth-straight-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-sweeps-rival-cal-poly-for-eighth-straight-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-sweeps-rival-cal-poly-for-eighth-straight-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-sweeps-rival-cal-poly-for-eighth-straight-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-sweeps-rival-cal-poly-for-eighth-straight-victory/","id":5281,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5280,5279,5278],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"First Place UCSB Faces Rival Cal Poly on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_06.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_06.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces rival Cal Poly with a seven-game winning streak on the line.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The currently tied for first place UCSB women’s volleyball team puts a seven-match winning streak on the line this weekend when it travels to Cal Poly to play the rival Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Now at 12-8 overall, 7-1 in the Big West, the Gauchos have been unstoppable in the last month, dropping just five of their last 26 sets played.

Sully once again played excellently at libero with 16 digs, and Grunt led the middle with five block assists.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is a road match against rival Cal Poly that will be played Saturday, 7 p.m. at the Mott Athletics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 28, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/ucsb-sweeps-pair-for-seventh-straight-win/","id":5278,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5277,5276,5275],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":10,"highestPage":13,"route":"/authors/63"}},"__N_SSG":true}
