The Gauchos shot just 8-30 (26.7 percent) from the field and 1-12 (8.3 percent) in the second half on their way to a 71-59 loss.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara falls to 1-2 in the young season while the Beavers went undefeated on their two-game weekend road trip to improve to a perfect 4-0 start for just the second time since 2000.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Gary Payton II filled up the box score once again for his team with a game-high 21 points on 8-13 from the field and 3-4 from three-point range. The reigning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year also finished with seven boards, four assists and two steals.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With a steal in each of his last 35 games, Payton II is just two short of the school record his father set from 1989-1990.</p>\n<p>An 8-2 run out of the gates by Oregon St. didn’t bode well for the Gauchos, who have had relatively slow starts in each of their first three games. UCSB answered with a 7-0 run, taking the lead after a pair of free throws by senior guard Michael Bryson, but the home side was only able to hold on to a 9-8 advantage for 12 seconds for its only lead of the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kept it close before a three-pointer by freshman guard Stephen Thompson Jr. gave the Beavers a 43-35 lead heading into halftime. Oregon St. shot lights out in the first half, going 8-10 on three-pointers through 20 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Going back to the final minutes of the first half, Oregon St. went on a 15-2 run to help put the game away.</p>\n<p>From there, UCSB was unable to find much of a flow on offense, finishing the night shooting 33.8 percent from the field and an ugly 18.2 percent from three.</p>\n<p>It was another disappointing game for sophomore Gabe Vincent, who finished with just three points on 1-8 shooting. Bryson and senior forward John Green finished with similar numbers, both shooting just above 30 percent to score 14 and 16 points, respectively, to lead the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Sam Beeler was one of the few bright spots for UCSB, recording his first career double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the game with a 39-37 rebounding advantage and turned the ball over just nine times compared to the Beavers’ 13, but shooting proved to be the difference. As a team, Santa Barbara has a field goal percentage of just 36.2 so far this season and are a miserable 23.4 percent from deep.</p>\n<p>Missing the efficiency of their focal point from the previous three seasons in Alan Williams, the team’s remaining big playmakers will need to step up their game moving forward for UCSB to have more success. Reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent is hitting just 25.8 percent of his shots playing alongside fellow guard junior Eric Childress, who is also shooting just 31.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a mid-week road game at San Francisco state this Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66737\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66737\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/","id":378,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[377,376,375],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall at No. 15 Cal, Open Home Schedule Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLu0-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLu0-03-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Despite 23 points from senior guard Michael Bryson, the UCSB men's basketball team was unable to contain the dynamic offense of No. 15 Cal in its 85-67 loss on Monday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A 13-2 deficit to open the game set the tone for the UCSB men’s basketball team on Monday as it fell 85-67 at No. 15 Cal.

There’s a lot of things we’ve got to work on and shooting might be one piece but we have a lot defensively to work on as well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off a season-opener in which UCSB shot just 34.9 percent from the field, things weren’t much better to open the game at Cal as the Gauchos missed their first seven shots before center Ami Lakoju’s got them on the board at the 14:38 mark, already trailing 8-0 prior to the freshman’s layup.</p>\n<p>Berkeley’s junior guard Jordan Mathews came out hot, knocking down a pair of triples and converting a three-point play during the Bears 13-2 run to open the game. He went on to finish with 16 points and seven rebounds while going 3-6 from deep and 6-9 from the field.</p>\n<p>From there, senior guard Tyrone Wallace took over as he led Cal with a 15-point first half, including 8-9 shooting from the free throw line to give his team a 47-28 lead heading into the break. The Bears shot 50 percent in the half compared to just 32.3 percent for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior guard John Green was miscredited with a third personal foul in the first stanza, causing him to play only nine minutes before the foul was reversed in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a much better effort in the final 20 minutes, outscoring Berkeley 39-38 on 14-29 shooting as a team, but the end result was never in question.</p>\n<p>One bright spot for UCSB was the play of senior guard Michael Bryson, who played his first game of the season. The Gauchos’ leading returning scorer and rebounder scored 23 points on 8-18 from the field and an impressive 4-8 from three to lead his team on offense.</p>\n<p>Wallace finished with game-highs of 24 points and six assists on an efficient 6-10 shooting night and 11-13 from the line to lead Cal. Freshman forward Jaylen Brown scored in double-digits for the second consecutive game, recording 17 points to go along with seven boards.</p>\n<p>UCSB now shifts its focus to Saturday’s game against Oregon State. With two impressive 20-point wins in their first two games, the Beavers are currently 2-0 and will play Rice later tonight.</p>\n<p>“We need to get stops,” Vincent said. “The more we can keep them out of the paint and off the free throw line like the other two teams we’ve played have been, the better off we’ll be and we can get out, run more and get more possessions.”</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Drew Eubanks has shot a remarkable 13-15 from the field through his first two career NCAA games, averaging a team-high 16 points a night. The Beavers have a total of five players averaging double-figures to start the year, including two off the bench, and are shooting a solid 49.6 percent as a team.</p>\n<p>Reigning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton II, son of NBA great Gary Payton, is another player shooting lights out at 55 percent. He averages 14 points and a team-leading 5.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to handle them just like we do everybody else,” Vincent said. “We’re going to play them straight up, keep them off the line and keep them out of the paint, make them shoot over us instead of around us.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, John Green has continued to show his growth coming off his first full season without missing significant time due to injury. He is currently second on the team averaging 17 points a night but has also been extremely helpful on the boards, pulling in a team-best nine per outing.</p>\n<p>Vincent is the team’s third leading-scorer at 10.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ first home game of the season will be played early at 2 p.m. this Saturday against Oregon State in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/","id":400,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[399,398,397],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Childress Tips In Game-Winner, UCSB Defeats Nebraska-Omaha 60-59","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Playing without senior Michael Bryson, the Gauchos finish the game on a 9-1 run to come away with a close win in their first game of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66481\" style=\"width: 195px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1809710560\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66506\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66481\" data-attachment-id=\"66481\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/john-green-drives-toward-the-hoop-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 6D\",\"caption\":\"John Green drives toward the hoop.

The basket was Childress’s only one on the night, capping off a 9-1 run over the final 4:19 to give the Gauchos a 60-59 win.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara earned the victory despite playing without senior guard Michael Bryson, the team’s leading returning scorer and rebounder from last season, who was suspended for one game by the NCAA for playing in an unsanctioned summer league game in July.</p>\n<p>Shouldering the load in Bryson’s place was senior guard John Green, who led the way with game-highs of 22 points and 13 rebounds. However, with Green fouling out with 3:54 left to play, Childress and sophomore point guard Gabe Vincent took over to bring UCSB back.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a close first half, the Mavericks finally took control thanks to a 25-4 run in the second half to put them up 58-51.</p>\n<p>With his team down by seven with less than five minutes to go, Vincent knocked down a deep three just 25 seconds prior to Green fouling out. Childress followed that up by knocking down two clutch free throws at the 3:02 mark to cut the lead to 58-56.</p>\n<p>Omaha’s Tre’Shawn Thurman went 1-for-2 at the line with 1:36 left to go, leading to a pretty driving score by Vincent just eight seconds later to make it a one point game at 59-58.</p>\n<p>A pair of missed three-point attempts by the Mavericks gave the Gauchos possession with 38 seconds left. After deciding not to call for a timeout, UCSB freshman Justin Burks failed to connect on a three with 22 ticks to go. Childress was able to rise up and tip the ball out to senior guard T.J. Taylor in the corner, leading to a Gaucho timeout with 12 seconds left.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Mitch Brewe received a pass from Vincent and put up a shot with four seconds left that rimmed out, but Childress was there for the put back and Omaha was unable to get off a final shot.</p>\n<p>It was a poor shooting night for both teams, as the Gauchos finished shooting just 34.9 percent (22-63 FG) and the Mavericks not much better at 34.7 percent (17-49). UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams was surprised to come away with the win given his team’s 20 turnovers compared to just 10 assists, but the Gauchos were helped out by Omaha’s similar mark of 19 TOs and 10 assists.</p>\n<p>Brewe finished with nine points and five rebounds off the bench on a solid 4-5 shooting night. Senior guard DaJuan Smith reeled in a career-high eight rebounds, including four on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Omaha had three players score in double figures, including Thurman with a near double-double at 10 points, nine rebounds, and Randy Reed, who recorded 14 points and eight rebounds while going a perfect 8-8 from the line.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be back in action tonight on the road against Cal with tip-off set for 7 p.m. at Haas Pavilion. The Golden Bears came into the season ranked No. 14 in the nation and defeated Rice 97-65 in their season-opener as five different players scored in double figures.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/","id":399,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[398,397,396],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Valiant Effort from No. 15 UCSB Falls Short in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Playing in their first Big West final since 2011, the Gauchos fell 1-0 to Cal State Fullerton despite a 22-6 advantage in shots.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66463\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"750721530\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66505\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66463\" data-attachment-id=\"66463\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/msoccer_vsfullerton-20151114-dustinharris-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Before CSU Fullterton's defense can get to it, Nick DePuy traps the ball.

That’s what we strive for.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton also qualifies for the NCAA Tournament for the third consecutive year and will play Santa Clara in the first round on Thursday. Head Coach George Kuntz improved to an outstanding record of 13-1-1 in the Big West Tournament with the win, earning his sixth Big West title in the process.</p>\n<p>In a match that was dominated by the Gauchos from the opening whistle, it felt for much of the game as if the home side was bound to score at any moment. UCSB saw several close scoring chances in the first half clang off the crossbar, including a free kick by sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht from 30 yards out.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara headed into the break with a 9-2 advantage in shots and the game’s only shot on frame through 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>The second half began with a bit of a momentum change as UCSB’s freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg was subbed out due to injury and Fullerton found itself with possession more consistently.</p>\n<p>“Justin’s been dealing with a shoulder issue for about 2-3 weeks now. He warmed up today before the game and dove and he said he just can’t dive to his right,” Tim Vom Steeg said. “Realistically, he’s probably not going to get through the season. Obviously Justin is very disappointed right now.”</p>\n<p>Although recording just two shots in the first half, the Titans doubled that mark in a matter of seconds, as Bell gave Fullerton all it would need to come away with the upset victory. After a throw in, a shot from the right side by senior midfielder Julian Okai came hard off the right post and fell right to Bell, who knocked in his first goal of the season past sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke in the 52<sup>nd</sup> minute.</p>\n<p>“When the throw went in, unfortunately [junior midfielder Josue Espana] just couldn’t clear it. It’s just luck, really. They got the ball and they scored,” sophomore center back Fuad Adeniyi said. “Tonight I think the whole back four did a really good job, but unfortunately that’s the game that we play. One slip-up, one mistake can cost you the whole thing.”</p>\n<p>The shocking turnaround forced the Gauchos to go into an all-out offensive mode, putting attacking players in at nearly every position outside of center back. Junior Ismaila Jome led the onslaught down the left wing, beating defenders and sending in a number of crosses for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB finally got the chance it was looking for in the 82<sup>nd</sup> minute, after junior forward Nick DePuy blocked a pass in the midfield which led to his own breakaway. Before the nation’s second-leading goalscorer could get a shot away, he was taken down from behind by Fullerton’s Ricardo Covarrubias just outside the box, who was sent off with a straight red card.</p>\n<p>Playing up a man, the Gauchos continued to send everything they had forward, resulting in their best scoring opportunity of the game in the 85<sup>th</sup> minute. DePuy working a perfect 1-2 combination with freshman defender Sam Strong on the right side of the box, but his right-footed strike went wide of the far post and the Gauchos’ attempted comeback fell short soon after.</p>\n<p>“The sequence with about seven minutes left was our best soccer,” the older Vom Steeg said. “You’ve got Nick at that back post with everything to shoot at and he’s your best scorer. We had him 8 yards out to tie the game up a man and we know where that would’ve gone with them having the red card.”</p>\n<p>DePuy led his team with eight shots, three more than the entire Fullerton team, but UCSB was hurt by the fact that only six of its 22 shots were on goal. It was just the third time all season that Santa Barbara reached the 20-shot mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have not won a Big West Championship since 2010 and last played in the final in 2011, when they lost to UC Irvine 3-2. The road to their first NCAA championship since 2006 begins on Sunday when they host either South Carolina or Furman in the NCAA Tournament Second Round.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/","id":1472,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1471,1470,1469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Visits Midwest for Season Opener, Bryson Suspended","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After a strong exhibition performance, in which senior guards Michael Bryson and John Green combined for 43 points in a 66-45 win over SFSU, the UCSB men's basketball team will be on the road at Nebra...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The post Big-Al era officially tips off this Friday when the UCSB men’s basketball team heads on the road to face Nebraska-Omaha in both teams’ season-opener.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66358\" style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"922315923\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66357\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66358\" data-attachment-id=\"66358\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/michael-bryson-searches-for-a-way-past-the-defender-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 6D\",\"caption\":\"Michael Bryson searches for a way past the defender.

Senior guards John Green and Michael Bryson handled the offensive load in that game, scoring 23 and 20 points, respectively.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a series of unfortunate injuries kept Green out for much of his collegiate career, he was finally able to stay healthy last season, playing in all 33 games. His averages of 11.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game earned him an All-Big West Honorable Mention. He figures to be one of the team’s most critical players in his senior year, especially with the departure of UCSB great Alan Williams.</p>\n<p>Alongside Green as one of the team’s two starting guard/forward combo players is Bryson, the only Gaucho who was named to the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team. With averages of 13.9 points and 4.8 rebounds a game in 2014-15, Bryson was named First Team All-Big West. Unfortunately for UCSB, he will be unavailable for Friday’s game after he was suspended by the NCAA earlier this week for playing in an unsanctioned summer league game in July.</p>\n<p>With their most proven, consistent scorer out of the lineup, the Gauchos will need to rely on their other role players to provide a scoring punch. That shouldn’t be a problem for reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent. The sophomore had averages of 10.1 points and 2.1 assists per game last season and was second on the team in threes with 57, knocking the long ball down at an efficient rate of 41.6 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos still have huge shoes to fill in the middle with Williams, the program’s all-time leading rebounder and second all-time leading scorer, now playing in the Chinese Basketball Association. However, if Head Coach Bob Williams continues to stick with the starting lineup he used against San Francisco, which included two point guards in Vincent and junior Eric Childress, the former inside-out approach that utilized “Big Al” in the center position may be replaced with a small ball, guard-heavy offensive style.</p>\n<p>Nebraska-Omaha has not played since August, when it went a perfect 4-0 on a tour through Italy, outscoring its foreign opponents by an average margin of 48.5 points per game. In the Summit League Preseason Poll, the Mavericks were picked to finish seventh out of nine teams in the conference this season, with no players being named to the Preseason All-Conference first or second teams.</p>\n<p>Friday’s game will be the first of 10 non-conference games away from home for UCSB. The Gauchos will play only three non-conference home games this season and two games on a neutral site when they face Akron and Iona in Las Vegas over winter break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has not played a season opener without Big Al since 2011. Playing without him in 2014-15, the Gauchos went an impressive 5-2, a mark which gives them confidence that they will be able to succeed this season playing without their focal point from the last three years.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s and Nebraska-Omaha’s seasons tip-off at 5 p.m. this Friday at Ralston Arena in Nebraska.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of November 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66357\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66357\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/ucsb-visits-midwest-for-season-opener-bryson-suspended/","id":397,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[396,395,394],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Late Goal Springs No. 17 UCSB to Big West Final","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After defeating UC Davis for the third time in 2015, the Gauchos will play in their first Big West Tournament Championship since 2011 this Saturday against Cal State Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66388\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"603435463\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66391\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66388\" data-attachment-id=\"66388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/mens_soccer_ucd_111115_eric_swenson_006-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Ahinga Selemani crosses the ball in for an unsuccessful attempt on goal.

After being deadlocked with UC Davis through 78 minutes in the semifinal match on Wednesday, sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani unleashed a perfectly placed near-post strike from just outside the box to spring the Gauchos to a 1-0 victory.</p>\n<p>“Tonight was a tough game. Anytime you play a team that if they lose their season’s over, you’re going to get everything they have,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We played well tonight. We moved the ball around well, we had our best game in terms of possession, our backs did well in trying to control the game, and we took what they gave us.”</p>\n<p>With the win, Santa Barbara ends a streak of four consecutive postseason losses dating back to 2011 and improves to a record of 13-5-2 overall and 8-2-1 against Big West opponents.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After going winless in their final five regular season games, the Aggies defeated CSUN 2-1 in the quarterfinals to advance and have a chance to avenge two losses to the Gauchos in the previous three weeks. However, UCSB completed a perfect 3-0 sweep of Davis in 2015, dropping the Aggies to 8-10-3 overall, 3-5-3 conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now host Cal State Fullerton in the Big West Tournament finals this Saturday. The Titans overcame an early 1-0 deficit against Cal Poly last night to take a 3-1 win at home, thanks to a second half brace by sophomore midfielder Diego Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Fullerton enters the championship game this Saturday as the No. 1 seed in the Big West South, boasting a record of 12-7-1 overall, 7-3-1 conference.</p>\n<p>After having 11 days off since their last regular season game, the Gauchos came out rested and healthy on Wednesday night. The game marked the third consecutive year that UCSB has entered the semifinals with home-field advantage and the No. 1 seed, but in the past the Gauchos have not been able to get the job done despite playing at home, going 0-3 in the postseason since 2013.</p>\n<p>That all changed last night thanks to a timely one-two between Selemani and sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht, who was placed in a more attacking role than he has been for most of the season. After receiving the ball back on the give and go, Selemani fired a shocking shot in from 25 yards out to give UCSB its only goal against Davis all season that didn’t come from the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to finally bring a playoff win at home,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “We’ve had so many letdowns in front of our fans, but to finally get into that Big West final it’s a new experience for all of us and it’s a really good opportunity to make some noise and get into the NCAA Tournament.”</p>\n<p>It was the fourth goal for Selemani all season, justifying his All-Big West Second Team selection in his first year with UCSB.</p>\n<p>“My goal was basically to get as many chances as I could,” Selemani said. “I was fortunate enough to get a ball from Kevin in the second half. It’s a strength of mine to put the ball on my left foot and I was lucky enough to get it past the keeper.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara gained control of the game about 15 minutes in. Dominating possession for the rest of the first half and finding several good scoring chances. Junior Ismaila Jome, who has missed significant time this season with an ankle injury, was dangerous nearly every time he touched the ball, torching defenders and sending balls in from the left wing. However, Davis was able to keep the game scoreless all the way until the break.</p>\n<p>“I had the luxury tonight of this being the first time that I can remember going into the Big West Tournament with a full complement of players,” Vom Steeg said. “[Davis] got tired, we were able to press them a little bit, we needed one good shot and Ahinga got that for us tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies picked up the pressure in the second half, attacking UCSB hard on the counter. They found their best chance to score in the 54th minute, when a header by freshman forward Kristian Heptner forced freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make an outstanding one-handed, diving save just inside the post.</p>\n<p>It was a relatively quiet night for Vom Steeg, but his two saves in the game helped give UCSB its second consecutive 1-0 victory, both of which came against Davis.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was a great game. It was entertaining,” Davis Head Coach Dwayne Shaffer said. “I give all the credit to Santa Barbara, that’s probably the best team I’ve seen in Santa Barbara in five years. I was impressed.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will now shift its focus to Saturday’s game, when it will play a Fullerton team that it took two overtimes to defeat at home just over a month ago.</p>\n<p>The Big West Tournament Championship will be played Saturday night at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of November 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily

Senior forward Matt Wiesenfarth played the hero in that game, scoring his fourth goal of the season on a breakaway in the 93rd minute.</p>\n<p>In UCSB and UC Davis’ two meetings this season, the Gauchos came away victorious thanks to three goals from sophomore holding midfielder Kevin Feucht, all of which came from the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we’ve gotten three goals from the spot means that we’re doing some damage in the box,” Selemani said. “Obviously you want to get goals in other fashions, but I think the fact that we’re getting goals is important and the fact we’re getting wins is all that matters right now.”</p>\n<p>In the two teams’ first meeting at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos lost a 1-0 lead after conceding a 74th minute goal to junior Steven Guzman. It was a trademark goal for Davis that was characteristic of the gameplan it has continued to utilize against UCSB, being scored by a defender following a scramble off a long throw into the box.</p>\n<p>“We have to have high pressure and keep them from scoring set piece goals because that’s where they’re most dangerous,” junior left back Ismaila Jome said. “Their two center backs have their most goals, so if we just keep them from getting any headers in the box and play as well as we have throughout the season we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>However, junior forward Nick DePuy was dragged down in the box just 50 seconds after the Aggies’ equalizer, leading to Feucht’s second penalty of the game and eventual game-winner.</p>\n<p>Davis brings to town a physical, sluggish style that serves as somewhat of a foil to UCSB’s more traditional approach of passing and making good runs into the box. The Gauchos ended the season with the eighth best offense in the nation, scoring 38 goals through 19 games.</p>\n<p>“They have two guys, [sophomore forward Evan Barrett and junior forward Dashiell MacNamara], who are pretty quick,” Selemani said. “We just need to make sure we take those guys down and we have a good chance to win again.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ offensive attack can be summed up by the fact that its top two goal scorers during the regular season were defenders in senior Lucas Mohageg and redshirt freshman Roy Boateng. They will be looking to keep the score low as they wait for their chance to pack the box and find a goal off a good ball in or a fortunate bounce.</p>\n<p>“We work on [clearing] every practice, but especially [this week],” Selemani said. “We had everybody setting up in [Davis’] formations and defended like we would tomorrow, so hopefully that works as well and we get the result.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have had great success during conference play in recent years, they have been unable to get it done when it matters most, going 0-3 over the past two postseasons. That will likely change this time around with an experienced core group that has grown together over the years.</p>\n<p>“Since I’ve been here this is the best team as far as talent-wise, just collectively,” Jome said. “We have a good mix of younger guys and older guys and we know how big of a struggle it is to get into the postseason and win games.”</p>\n<p>Under Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, who received a record fifth conference Coach of the Year Award, UCSB’s dominant record this season was reflected in its dominance of the Big West yearly awards.</p>\n<p>Nick DePuy earned his second consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Year after scoring 15 goals through 19 games. To put that number in perspective, the four players who tied for second in goals in the conference had less than half of DePuy’s total with seven. Only one NCAA player, USC Upstate’s Gordon Wild (16), has scored more goals than him this year.</p>\n<p>The 6-4 DePuy has been unstoppable all season thanks to a combination of size, good feet, extremely accurate shooting, and an excellent supporting cast that has given him great service. All of these factors have helped catapult him to a nation-leading eight game-winning goals. His individual success has led to the team’s success ever since he switched from the midfield to forward midway through last season, proven by UCSB’s undefeated record of 16-0-4 in games he has scored in.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s aforementioned supporting cast includes Big West Freshman of the Year Geoffrey Acheampong, who scored four goals and led the Big West with 10 assists, good for sixth-best in the country. UCSB first-year players have now won the award in four consecutive seasons and six of the past seven.</p>\n<p>The former Cate School star received a Big West Honorable Mention alongside sophomore left back Randy Mendoza and freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>Other players joining DePuy on the All-Big West First Team were Feucht, who was second on the team with five goals, junior midfielder Josue Espana, and senior defender Duncan Backus.</p>\n<p>Selemani rounds out the long list of Gauchos receiving accolades, being named All-Big West Second Team with four goals. He ranked third in the conference with 50 shots, putting a high amount of pressure on back lines all year to help free up space for his teammates.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will benefit from having 11 nights of rest since their last game against Davis on Halloween, thanks to their winning the No. 1 seed and a bye in the first round of the postseason. In that final regular season game against the Aggies, UCSB came away with a 1-0 victory after freshman forward Cody Gibson was taken down in the box, leading to another game-winning penalty by Feucht.</p>\n<p>The winner of Wednesday’s game will face the winner between Cal Poly and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. If the Gauchos win, they will be at home for the championship game as they look to win their first Big West title since 2010.</p>\n<p>“Tomorrow is the biggest test because we haven’t made it to the final in [four] years,” Jome said. “The biggest challenge would just be winning tomorrow, and after that, we have to take it game by game.”</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s game begins at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

He was one of three starters to knock down a pair of three-pointers on the night, along with Bryson and freshman guard Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>After a slow start for UCSB, which trailed 4-0 several minutes into the game, a three-pointer from Vincent began a 14-0 run for the Gauchos as they took control of the lead for the remainder of the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a layup by Green at the 6:35 mark gave Santa Barbara an 18-10 lead, the Gators responded well, going on an 11-4 run to cut the deficit to just one point.

Bryson meanwhile had a solid overall game, shooting 8-17 from the field and picking up six boards, two assists, a steal and a block.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for San Francisco State was forward Floyd Wormley. The senior shot 4-12 from the field to end the night with 12 points, six rebounds and four assists, all team-highs. As a team, the Gators finished an inefficient 15-59 (25.4 percent) from the field, compared to 25-57 (43.9 percent) for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Senior point guard T.J. Taylor didn’t score, but was able to impact the game in other ways as he tied Vincent with five assists for the team-lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to face the University of Nebraska-Omaha in its regular season opener this Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/strong-second-half-powers-gauchos-to-win-in-preseason-opener/","id":394,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[393,392,391],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Set for First Tip Off in Post Big-Al Era","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-16-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-16-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team gears up for its first exhibition game this Sunday.

He leaves behind huge shoes to fill after finishing as UCSB’s all-time leader in rebounds and second all-time leader in scoring.</p>\n<p>Even though they have to replace two key starters, the Gauchos received 161 points in the Big West Preseason Coaches’ Poll, predicting a second place finish behind only UC Irvine. After a 72-63 overtime win in the Big West Semifinals, the Anteaters went on to win the conference and earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Despite the lineup changes, UCSB will not be without strong leadership this season. Senior guard Michael Bryson was named to the Big West All-First Team after averaging 13.9 points per game in 2014-15, good for ninth best in the conference. His career point total of 1,043 is the most among active Big West players, helping make him the only Gaucho voted to the Big West Preseason All-Conference team.</p>\n<p>Alongside Bryson, senior guard John Green has overcome a series of injuries throughout his collegiate career to establish himself as one of the best players on the team. After missing all but four games from 2011-2014, Green played all 33 games in 2015 while averaging the third most points per game on the team at 11.3 on an impressive 47.7 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent will have an increased role in the backcourt with the absence of Harmon. In just his first year with the Gauchos, Vincent averaged 10.1 points and 2.1 assists per game while knocking down 57 three pointers, the second most by a freshman in program history.</p>\n<p>UCSB added a handful of freshmen in the offseason, including point guard Grant Troutt from Episcopal School of Dallas and forward Jarriese Blackmon.</p>\n<p>Troutt averaged 12 points, five assists and two rebounds in his junior year and impressed scouts with his play in the AAU circuit to earn a spot with UCSB. He will join a crowded backcourt that already has several other point guards including junior Eric Childress and senior T.J. Taylor. Similar to last year, Head Coach Bob Williams may plan to use different combinations which utilize three or four point guards throughout the season.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Blackmon was Utah’s Player of the Year, leading his team to the state championship tournament with averages of 16.7 points, 10.7 rebounds and over two assists, blocks and steals per game.

They will need a win against Cal Poly and a UC Davis loss on Saturday to secure the final spot in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The seats at Harder Stadium weren’t even warm yet before DePuy got his team on the board less than two minutes into the game. After UCSB won a free kick deep in the left midfield, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong played a long ball towards senior defender Duncan Backus at the far post.</p>\n<p>Despite a difficult angle, Backus redirected a header back across goal right where DePuy was making his run, and he knocked it in to open the scoring. The goal was the fastest scored for UCSB all season, coming just 104 seconds into the game and marking the second straight game in which DePuy has scored.</p>\n<p>The two sides provided little action until the second half, when DePuy capped off his night recording his third brace of the year. In the 53rd minute, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong played a simple cross in from the right side towards DePuy, who rose above his defender and headed it down and in towards the far post as he has done so many times this season.</p>\n<p>“We wanted the second goal because this is a dangerous team,” Vom Steeg said. “They score a lot on free kicks, they break out really well, and they haven’t been shutout in a while, so my concern was I didn’t think one goal was going to be enough.”</p>\n<p>UCSB went up 2-0 for the second straight game, but it took just 17 seconds for the Hornets to answer back and cut the lead in half. A cross from the left wing by junior midfielder Ivan Ramirez cut through the Santa Barbara defense before senior forward Isaac Flores put away his fourth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>However, unlike when they tied Cal Poly 2-2 last Saturday, the Gauchos were able to hold on to extend their unbeaten streak to three games.</p>\n<p>“Credit to the team, we did finish this game off a little better than [against Cal Poly],” Vom Steeg said. “We took a couple balls to the corner, we made it a throw in game, we won the head balls in the box that we had to win. All those things that we did not do against Cal Poly, we did tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Big West has seen quite a few goals from the Gauchos this season, who lead the conference with 37 total, but the offensive success can be attributed mostly to DePuy, who ranks first in the nation with 15 goals and eight game-winners.</p>\n<p>“The one thing we discussed at the beginning of the season was if he wanted to pick up 15, 16 goals, he would have to work really hard in the offseason on attacking the ball and either putting it back across the box or getting it down,” Vom Steeg said. “He put the work in to be where he is right now. It’s very hard to stop him when he gets the kind of service he got today.”</p>\n<p>Picking up an assist on both of UCSB’s goals, Acheampong now has 10 for the year, three more than anyone else in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Today I think it all kind of came together,” Acheampong said. “The big guys have been open all year. It just comes down to how efficiently I can get it done and how well I’m able to find them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos lost junior winger Ismaila Jome to injury in the first half and he did not return. Jome recently returned to the lineup after missing nearly half the season with an ankle injury.</p>\n<p>With Cal Poly drawing 0-0 against UC Davis last night, both the UCSB men’s and women’s soccer teams clinched a spot in the Big West Tournament for the first time since 2009. The Gauchos can keep the No. 1 seed, a first round bye and home-field advantage in the tournament for the third-straight year with a win or tie on Saturday or a Cal Poly loss or tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB will close out the regular season at UC Davis on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65947\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65947\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/","id":1462,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1461,1460,1459],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 18 UCSB Seeks Revenge in Home Finale Against Sac St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_026-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_026-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Still just a point in front of No. 22 Cal Poly for first place, the Gauchos need a win against a team that beat them 5-2 earlier this month.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65790\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_026-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"778732682\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65870\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65790\" data-attachment-id=\"65790\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/ismaila-jome-passes-the-ball-in-towards-the-box-eric-swensondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_026-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Ismaila Jome passes the ball in towards the box.

The Gauchos suffered an embarrassing 5-2 loss to the Hornets the last time the two teams played earlier this month.</p>\n<p>“At some point, hopefully sooner rather than later, we’ll figure out how to be good and finish off a game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Today we’ve got payback, so our guys should be excited about that.”</p>\n<p>With just two games remaining, Santa Barbara possesses the Big West’s best record at 10-5-2 overall and 5-2-1 in conference.

They trail UC Davis by just one point for the final playoff spot.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos are coming off perhaps the most disappointing undefeated week in program history. After a sluggish, frustrating 2-1 win over UC Davis last Wednesday, UCSB let a 2-0 lead slip away against Cal Poly on Saturday, conceding a game-tying goal with just four seconds left to go. The game ended in a 2-2 tie after two overtimes.</p>\n<p>A win would have given the Gauchos complete control in the standings, but they are still just a point ahead of the Mustangs for the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“The result’s disappointing,” Vom Steeg said. “It doesn’t change what we have to do. Everything’s still out in front of us, but it’s still disappointing because it’s four seconds left to win a game.”</p>\n<p>When UCSB traveled to Sac St. two weeks ago riding a five-game win streak, the Hornets shocked the nation, pulling off a dominant upset. After Santa Barbara trailed 2-0 heading into the half, a red card to defender Sam Strong in the 61<sup>st</sup> minute made matters much worse, and Sac St. punished its helpless opponent to the tune of five goals, the most the team has scored against a Division I opponent since 2010.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Brad Bumgarner was a key player in the 5-2 win, picking up both an assist and a goal within the first 34 minutes. He leads Sac St. with six goals, 13 points and three game-winners.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, the 2-2 tie against Cal Poly marked the end of a three-game scoring drought for junior Nick DePuy. The 6-4 forward leads the Big West with 13 goals – six more than any other player – and seven game-winners.</p>\n<p>DePuy has benefited from having a number of attacking options in support this year. Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong hooked up with sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani on Saturday for his eighth assist of the season, also a conference-best. Selemani put away his fourth goal, the second most on the team, ending a seven-game scoring drought.</p>\n<p>Defensively, neither team has been particularly stellar since the beginning of the conference season. UCSB ranks sixth in the Big West with a 1.63 goals against average while Sac St. comes in just behind at seventh, giving up 1.70 goals per game in conference play.</p>\n<p>While the Hornets defense is not going to have an easy time going up against the Big West’s top offense playing on its home turf, they will have their best chance of keeping the score low with goalkeeper James Del Curto playing in goal. The sophomore ranks 22<sup>nd</sup> in the nation with 4.75 saves per game, while he comes in at No. 2 in the Big West with a .760 save percentage.</p>\n<p>Scoring opportunities might be in abundance for the Gauchos tonight, but they’ll have to put away their chances if they are going to be able to pick up a win in their final home game of the season.</p>\n<p>Seniors Duncan Backus, Adam Carn-Saferstein, Brandon Brockway and Christian Rodriguez will be honored tonight as part of Senior Night.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Sac St. will kickoff at 7 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65870\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65870\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/","id":1482,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1481,1480,1479],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Classic Blue-Green Rivalry Game Ends in 2-2 Tie","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_024-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_024-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Instant classic.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>This past Saturday, the Blue-Green rivalry between the No. 18 UCSB men’s soccer team and No. 22 Cal Poly delivered an absolute classic in front of nearly 15,000 fans in attendance and thousands more viewers on Fox Sports Prime Ticket. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, a 2-0 first half lead was not enough to avenge a 3-2 loss to the Mustangs seven days prior, as the road side was able to find an equalizer with just four seconds left in regulation to send the game to an eventual 2-2 tie.</p>\n<p>Despite the result, UCSB still remains in first place in the Big West North at 10-5-2 overall and 5-2-1 in conference. Cal Poly continues to linger just a point out of first with a record of 9-3-4 overall, 4-1-3 Big West.</p>\n<p>“We were four seconds from winning the game, so obviously, it’s a disappointed locker room,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We played a good first half, we got the two goals, I thought our defense was the best they’ve been all year. The frustration is that when you do a lot of the right things, hopefully the guys are rewarded at the end of the day.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The 14,919 members in the audience now take over last year’s Blue-Green game for the second largest campus crowd in NCAA history. Since 1980, 13 of the 19 largest crowds have been UCSB-Cal Poly matchups, with the largest ever (15,896) being when UCSB hosted UCLA back in 2010.</p>\n<p>The final seconds of regulation seemed to move in slow motion as the Gaucho faithful waited patiently for the clock to reach zero. With time running out, Cal Poly’s senior defender Kip Colvey sent in a cross towards the far post where senior forward Matt Lagrassa, who had been winning headers all night, rose above a UCSB defender to place a shot on goal, forcing freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make a remarkable one-handed save.</p>\n<p>“I could tell [Lagrassa] was going to head it to the far side. The ground is a little sloppy on that side of the field so I lost my footing a little bit but I was fortunate to get a hand out,” the younger Vom Steeg said. “To be honest I thought I should’ve done a little better with it, but with plays like that it happens pretty quickly, and when you have the ball bouncing around the six-yard box, you usually get punished.”</p>\n<p>The ball eventually fell to freshman forward Jared Pressley right inside the six-yard box, who scored a goal that will be remembered for years to come into the open net. It was just the second goal of his career.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZK2nP8X_W6o?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>“We’ve made this repeated mistake when balls get played into the box where we get stuck watching while the attacking player just keeps going forward,” Vom Steeg said. “That back post head ball is probably where [sophomore forward Kevin Feucht] would’ve been. It’s unfortunate because it takes away from a really good effort all night.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos dominated the game from the outset, looking comfortable playing in the spotlight of a much-hyped, televised game between two teams widely accepted to have the greatest rivalry in college soccer. It took little more than 10 minutes for them to open the scoring, as freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong pounced on a loose ball in the attacking third to set up for the cross.</p>\n<p>After not scoring in seven consecutive games, sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani was found making a near post run to tap it in with his favored left foot, giving UCSB the early advantage.</p>\n<p>With fatigue and injuries forcing Vom Steeg to utilize his bench early and often, he was rewarded in the 43<sup>rd</sup> minute when freshman forward Cody Gibson played it in from the right wing to find a sky-high Nick DePuy. The junior forward outjumped his defender, placing a perfect header towards the far post and past Cal Poly senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton to give UCSB a huge 2-0 advantage heading into halftime.</p>\n<p>“Physically, they could just not stay with [our forwards]. That’s where the gameplan was,” Vom Steeg said. “I asked Ahinga to start making his near post run, he hasn’t made it in the last five games. He made the run, and we got two good services.”</p>\n<p>The goal was DePuy’s Big West-leading 13<sup>th</sup> of the season.</p>\n<p>Things changed in the second half with the Gauchos facing the dilemma of sitting back or going for a third goal to put the game away. With Cal Poly sending men forward for the remainder of the game, UCSB eventually got punished on the break.</p>\n<p>In the 73<sup>rd</sup> minute, junior defender Jack O’Connor was all by himself down the left side, sending in a cross towards an unmarked Chase Minter in the box. The senior forward/midfielder put away a solid strike, giving him his fifth goal of the year and cutting the deficit in half.</p>\n<p>“We all know that Minter is a very good player. We all know that we need to not get beat out wide,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ve spent the last two weeks working on finding men in the box, and if you’re going to leave anyone open, don’t leave their best player, that’s a pretty simple rule. We didn’t find him and it was a good finish.”</p>\n<p>From there, two overtime periods yielded few chances before a final corner kick by Acheampong hit the post as time expired. The result was the second consecutive 2-2 tie between the two teams at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“A lot of positive things that our team did tonight. Again, I feel bad for the players to be not going home tonight having won the game,” Vom Steeg said. “We are in first place and that is a top-20 RPI team, so we didn’t do anything bad tonight, but that’s going in my fourth column of games that we left out there this season. Hopefully we’ll learn and be here in a playoff situation saying we figured out with ten seconds left how to clear a ball.”</p>\n<p>It’s never fun to dwell on what-if scenarios, but had the Gauchos not lost Feucht, their best holding midfielder, to a suspension on yellow card accumulation, they may have been able to hold on in a game like this. In the German’s place, senior right back Duncan Backus, who Vom Steeg named the man of the match, stepped in to do a phenomenal job in an unfamiliar center defensive midfielder role.</p>\n<p>“I’m just happy that the coaches put the trust in me to play a position,” Backus said. “The main thing was just defend, work hard, connect my passes and get the ball to the dangerous guys that can go do damage. I just made sure that we aren’t missing Kevin too much.”</p>\n<p>If these two teams play each other again in the Big West Tournament, we can expect an even crazier atmosphere than the ones we’ve witnessed in the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is a rematch against Sacramento St. on Wednesday at home.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/","id":1486,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1485,1484,1483],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry: Chapter Two","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The time has arrived!

The Mustangs picked up a big win themselves yesterday over Sac St. to stay just behind Santa Barbara at 9-3-3 overall and 4-1-2 in conference.</p>\n<p>For those who weren’t there last year when the Gauchos hosted the Mustangs in October 2014, the annual Blue-Green matchup drew an audience of 14,345 crazy fans, the second-largest campus crowd in NCAA history.</p>\n<p>That number could very well go even higher this time around, with both top-20 sides generating a high level of buzz so far this season.</p>\n<p>“That was a big part of my recruitment,” sophomore defender Fuad Adeniyi said. “I’ve been dreaming about playing in front of [large crowds], especially our fans, who we all know and love. They all pump us up for the game. It’s really, really good playing in front of them.”</p>\n<p>Expectations were high for the Gauchos coming into the year after having finished with a No. 1 seed in each of the past two seasons, and they have not disappointed in 2015.</p>\n<p>Junior Nick DePuy hasn’t been able to stay out of the headlines over the past year, currently leading the nation in game-winning goals with seven and ranking second overall with 12.</p>\n<p>That’s not too bad of a stat line for a player that didn’t even play forward until midway through his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>DePuy isn’t the only Gaucho making noise in the stat department this season. Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong has been absolutely crucial for his team, tied for the Big West lead in assists with seven in just his freshman year while picking up a point in eight of the Gauchos’ last 11 games.</p>\n<p>Despite a perfect 4-0 start to conference play, the Big West has since learned that UCSB is most certainly not unbeatable. A terribly disappointing 5-2 loss at Sac St. last Wednesday ended a five-game winning streak for Santa Barbara just three days before it suffered its second straight loss at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Those two losses were not all negative for UCSB, however, as they saw the return of junior left back Ismaila Jome. After missing nearly eight full games with an ankle sprain, the former Big West Freshman of the Year showed just how important he is by scoring in each of his first two games back.</p>\n<p>“I think the losses affected us in a good way,” sophomore left back Randy Mendoza said. “We were on a high when we were 4-0, and I think it’s making us hungry and realize that nothing is going to be given to us.”</p>\n<p>Defensive issues have become somewhat of a plague for the Gauchos since the beginning of Big West play. Through their first six conference games, they conceded 11 goals, just one less than the conference’s worst defenses over that span.</p>\n<p>Leading the UCSB defense is a player who is no stranger to the Blue-Green rivalry in goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, son of long-time UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>The freshman, who has spent time playing for the US men’s national soccer team (USMNT) U-20 squads, has had a solid year, going 10-4 as a starter and ranking fifth in the conference in goals against average at 1.32.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been in the stands for quite a few [UCSB-Cal Poly games] — some wins, some losses,” the younger Vom Steeg said. “It’s a real emotional game.”</p>\n<p>With three games still to play this season, the Mustangs have already surpassed their mark of eight wins in 2014.</p>\n<p>It’s no surprise that Cal Poly has been able to turn things around this year behind first year head coach Steve Sampson, who boasts an incredible resume that few coaches at this level, if any, could rival.</p>\n<p>Sampson has coached at virtually every competitive level, leading Santa Clara to a national championship in 1989, managing the US Men’s National Team in the 1998 World Cup, leading the Costa Rican national team to its highest ever FIFA world ranking of 17 in 2004 and winning both the U.S. Open Cup and MLS Cup in 2004 with the Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have lost just one game out of their last nine, picking up their biggest win of the year just five days ago at home against UCSB.</p>\n<p>After a thrilling first half in which both teams notched two goals, a sold-out crowd of 11,075 was forced to wait until the 104th minute before Cal Poly’s junior defender Kody Wakasa scored his first career goal on a corner kick, sending UCSB to its second straight Big West loss and bringing Cal Poly just one point out of first.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to dominate in the shot department, outshooting the Mustangs 23-12, but Cal Poly’s senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton was able to make seven big saves to help his team to victory.<br>\nHamilton currently sits at second in the Big West with a 1.01 goals against average.</p>\n<p>“Saturday was really tough. I thought we deserved to win and with seven minutes left they score off a corner kick. It was a pretty crazy environment,” Justin Vom Steeg said. “I’m really looking forward to this Saturday to get some revenge and hopefully we can show them up with a big victory in front of our home crowd.”</p>\n<p>The large audience tied for the 12th largest regular season crowd in NCAA history, but will likely be even bigger this Saturday at Harder Stadium, which seats 17,000. The Blue-Green rivalry is considered the greatest rivalry in college soccer for a reason, as evidenced by the fact that the two sides have provided 12 of the 18 largest audiences in college soccer since 1980.</p>\n<p>Looking at how the two teams have fared against one another over the years, UCSB has come away with the advantage at 45-18-7. However, the Mustangs have done well to flip the script in recent years, outdueling the Gauchos to the tune of a 4-3-2 record through their last nine meetings.</p>\n<p>While many Gaucho supporters are looking at this storied rivalry’s upcoming installment as a chance for revenge, Jome summed up his team’s mindset in two words: “Just win.” Regardless of all the hype, statistics and big names involved in this game, we’ll just have to wait for Saturday to see what happens.</p>\n<p>The second Blue-Green rivalry matchup of 2015 will kick off at 7 p.m. this Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 13 of October 22, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/","id":1487,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1486,1485,1484],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 19 UCSB Downs UC Davis in First of Crucial Three-Game Homestand","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-v-UC-Irvine-Big-West-Semis-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7097.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-v-UC-Irvine-Big-West-Semis-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7097.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One down, three to go before the conclusion of the 2015 regular season.

Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht scored twice from the penalty spot, giving him four goals in the last four games, as he led his team to a crucial 2-1 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“Really the story of tonight is we did enough to win and that’s all there really is to say about it,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said after the game.</p>\n<p>The win ends a two-game losing streak for the Gauchos, keeping them just one point in front of No. 20 Cal Poly for first place in the Big West North Division. UCSB is now 10-5-1 overall and 5-2 in conference, while the Aggies, who had gone undefeated in four straight, fall four points out of first at 7-7-2 overall, 3-2-2 Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Playing without junior midfielder Josue Espana, who was suspended after picking up two yellow cards in UCSB’s game last Saturday at Cal Poly, the Gauchos struggled to find a flow on their offensive half.</p>\n<p>“Josue has started and played basically every minute for us and he controls the middle of our field. That made a huge difference,” Vom Steeg said. “Without him in the game, we were lost.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, a pair of crucial mistakes by Davis defenders cost them the game.</p>\n<p>After controlling the game through the first 15 minutes, midfielder Seo-In Kim brought the ball down the right flank before sophomore defender Greg Salazar’s attempted clearance came right back down off Kim’s arm. The junior transfer from Duke quickly recovered the ball before sending in a cross, ironically coming off of Salazar’s arm this time and resulting in a UCSB penalty.</p>\n<p>“There are referees where literally no matter what happens on the field, they’re not going to call it,” Vom Steeg said. “The referee tonight will call PKs. Definitely the arm was stretched, so I thought that first one was a good PK call.”</p>\n<p>It was Feucht who stepped up to take the penalty for the Gauchos, as he did against Cal State Fullerton in UCSB’s last home outing 11 days prior. The German showed great composure from the spot, seeming to hesitate at the last moment before taking the shot. After seeing Davis redshirt junior goalkeeper Armando Quezada go left, Feucht calmly slotted the ball into the right corner, giving the Gauchos an early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“The first half we were moving so well. It was just a matter of time,” Kim said. “Fortunately, we got a cross and [Salazar] handballed it, and Kevin of course is going to tuck it away.”</p>\n<p>Following a solid first 20 minutes of play, UCSB was unable to establish any kind of offensive flow for the rest of the first half. As the second half kicked off, momentum quickly turned the Aggies’ way, as they forced turnovers in the Gauchos’ defensive third and came close to scoring on a number of occasions.</p>\n<p>Davis finally found an equalizer in the 74<sup>th</sup> minute off a long throw into the box. A scramble for the ball resulted in a poor defensive clearance from just in front of goal and junior defender Steven Guzman capitalized, lobbing a header over freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg from about eight yards out to tie the game at 1-1.</p>\n<p>“In general, I thought we did decent [defending] the throw in,” Vom Steeg said. “But you put enough bodies inside the six yard box and bounce it around and do it 15 times… I hope everybody knows it’s not really soccer.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ unorthodox attacking methods brought them level with UCSB, but not for long. Just 70 seconds after the equalizer, junior forward Nick DePuy beat his defender in the box before being dragged down by a reckless tackle from senior defender/midfielder Lucas Mohageg, awarding UCSB its second penalty of the night.</p>\n<p>“Nick did a good job of dropping his shoulder and getting in front of [Mohageg],” Vom Steeg said. “As a defender at that point, I’d let him go a little bit, but the minute Nick got in front and the defender now is trying to save the day with a tackle, I would say around the world that one gets called.”</p>\n<p>Once again, it was Feucht stepping up to put the Gauchos up by one, this time firing it into the left corner with no hesitation while Quezada dove to the right post. That would be the high moment of the game for Feucht, who celebrated with a spectacular flip after notching his fourth goal for UCSB in as many games.</p>\n<p>From there, the Gauchos were able to hold on for the 2-1 victory, but they suffered another huge loss before the game was over. With just 4:33 remaining, a free kick that was awarded to Davis was delayed when Feucht kicked the ball away, resulting in his fifth yellow card of the season.</p>\n<p>This means that UCSB will be without its best holding midfielder for an even more crucial matchup with second place Cal Poly this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The reason why it feels like a loss is because we did lose [Feucht] tonight on a fifth yellow,” Vom Steeg said. “We seem to make mistakes that really hurt us, and that’s obviously a mistake because there was no point. Now you’ve got two days to redo all your set pieces and your defensive marking because you’ve got to drop a new player in.”</p>\n<p>Already facing the challenges of fatigue, injuries, and a top-20 ranked Cal Poly team that just beat UCSB 3-2 in double overtime last Saturday, Feucht’s suspension could not have come at a worse time.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard for me to walk in and scream, yell and get animated when the reality is the guys are giving you everything they have. At some point you just get tired,” Vom Steeg said. “You’re now deep into the bench. It’s why we carry 28 players and you’ll have to see a bunch of them Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Despite his frustrations after a grueling contest, Vom Steeg was still able to find one silver lining.</p>\n<p>“At least, good news, Josue will be fresh,” he said with a smile.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry game will be played for the second time in seven days this Saturday at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>The Aggies will get their shot at revenge against the Gauchos in both team’s regular season finale at Davis on Halloween.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/","id":1485,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1484,1483,1482],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nick DePuy: UCSB’s Humble Beast","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FEAT-MensSoccer_UCR_Oct-08_BRANDT_9533-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FEAT-MensSoccer_UCR_Oct-08_BRANDT_9533-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Over the past 13 months, Nick DePuy has meant everything to the Gauchos.

Spencer Brandt/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The year is 2014. The UCSB men’s soccer team is coming off an excellent bounce-back year in which it went undefeated in conference play on the way to a second round appearance in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg knows that things are going to be different this time around, as he has to replace nearly half of his team’s goal scoring production which previously came from graduated senior forwards Goffin Boyoko and Achille Campion.</p>\n<p>Nearing the midpoint of the season, things haven’t been going so well. The Gauchos have struggled to score goals and have managed a record of 2-3-1 through six games – not nearly up to UCSB’s high standards.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Having tried nearly everything he could think of in search of goals, Vom Steeg is forced to make a big decision in the final weekend before conference play begins.</p>\n<p>Thus begins the story of Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>“We were at the point in our season where we were below .500. We had tried every forward combination we had and we couldn’t get results from them,” Vom Steeg said. “Nick was our next best option as a big target player with good size. It was a little bit out of desperation in terms of putting him up front, but we had seen a lot of things in practice that told us he might do well.”</p>\n<p>Playing San Diego State on September 26 of last year, DePuy, a sophomore who had seen limited playing time being moved around the midfield and center back positions, got his first ever start at forward. Prior to that game, the 6-4 Irvine native had just one career goal, scored three weeks prior in a 1-1 tie against Northwestern.</p>\n<p>Little did anyone know, this season was about to get turned around in a big way.</p>\n<p>“I knew especially after my freshman year when we had a lot of seniors graduate that we were kind of low on the offensive side,” DePuy said. “I just wanted to work as hard as I could and help the team, whether that’s on defense or going up top and scoring a goal.”</p>\n<p>And help his team he did, as he capitalized on his first start as the team’s leading offensive option by tapping home a goal in the 21st minute. The 1-0 result got UCSB back on track as it headed into Big West play, sparking a season-best run of four straight wins.</p>\n<p>Not only did DePuy notch the first of his nation-best 13 game-winners over the past 13 months, but he began cementing his spot as the focal point in the Gauchos’ offense.</p>\n<p>“He got us the goal, he won the game, and that’s going to lead to the next start, which leads to another goal and another start,” Vom Steeg said. “If you’re looking for goals and you’re getting goals, you’re not going to mess with that. After five or six games, we saw that up front could be the place for him.”</p>\n<p>Having been voted the overwhelming favorites to finish first in the North Division in the 2014 Big West Preseason Coaches Poll, the Gauchos entered conference play last year at 4-3-1 and well short of living up to their own standards.</p>\n<p>Facing Cal State Northridge in its Big West opener, UCSB was able to overcome a 1-0 deficit thanks to a 71st minute winner by DePuy, who headed in a far post cross from teammate Drew Murphy back across the six-yard box.</p>\n<p>Neither the weekend nor DePuy were done at that point. Just two days later, UC Irvine came to town boasting a No. 3 national ranking as it looked to steal one on the road.</p>\n<p>In one of the most memorable moments in UCSB’s recent history, DePuy stunned the Anteaters with an unbelievable strike from 30 yards out, giving the Gauchos a 1-0 lead with just 37 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>“I had a good chance early in that game and I knew I had to get that one back. I got the ball, I just wanted to hit it on frame and it went right where I wanted it to go,” DePuy said. “That was probably my most memorable goal here, especially since it was at home in front of a couple 1,000 people and against Irvine.”</p>\n<p>With his second game-winner in three nights, and despite never having played forward for an extended period of time, the now former midfielder was suddenly thrust into the national spotlight, earning both a Big West Offensive Player of the Week and a National Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>“Things definitely started moving pretty fast after that. It was an honor,” DePuy said. “I’m glad I could get that achievement, but in the back of my head, obviously I was just thinking, ‘Help this team win,’ and I’m glad I could do that.”</p>\n<p>Never one to boast about his individual achievements, the team-first attitude that DePuy has made evident every time he steps on the field is a key reason for why he has been so dominant over the past two seasons. It certainly hasn’t hurt in building a high level of trust with his head coach, as he continues to prove that he can get the job done each and every time he steps on the field.</p>\n<p>“It’s a team sport. I wouldn’t be able to score those goals if someone didn’t cross it, and we wouldn’t win without our defense,” DePuy said. “I think [Vom Steeg] understands the trust aspect, that I’m going to work hard for my teammates and I’m a good forward that’s going to hold up the play. That helps a lot in the sense that we’ve known each other for two years already and we still have another year and a half to go.”</p>\n<p>Starting at forward the rest of the season, DePuy went on to score six game-winners and 10 goals overall – good for second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Ever since making his first start at forward 30 games ago, DePuy has many times been the only difference between UCSB winning or losing. In games that he has scored, the Gauchos have a near-perfect, undefeated mark of 15-0-3.</p>\n<p>“Our success this year, it’s no surprise, will start and end with how Nick does in terms of him scoring goals,” Vom Steeg said. “When he scores goals, we win.”</p>\n<p>Proving that his breakout season was no fluke, the junior started his 2015 campaign the best way possible, scoring another decisive header against No. 9 Stanford in a 1-0 season-opening victory.</p>\n<p>Things seemed to start following the same script every game, as in the Gauchos’ first four Big West games this year, DePuy scored five goals – four of them game-winners.</p>\n<p>His list of streaks and achievements now reads like a perennial All-Star’s. At one point this season, DePuy earned his second career National Player of the Week award and three consecutive Big West Player of the Weeks, making him the first player ever to accomplish that feat. His total of five conference awards has him tied for third all-time in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Prior to last Wednesday’s game at Sacramento St., DePuy had scored an incredible 21 goals in 26 games, more than any player in the nation over that stretch. He currently sits atop the country with seven game-winners in 2015 and is tied for second with 12 scores.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen situations this year where Nick has really started to take over games and be completely dominant,” Vom Steeg said. “Now, we just need him to keep going in that direction.”</p>\n<p>It’s remarkable what DePuy has been able to accomplish, especially considering the fact that he had never been a permanent forward in his life prior to last season. As is the case with many breakout situations, it has been a combination of raw talent and excellent coaching that has led to all this success.</p>\n<p>“We recruited Nick on 100 percent potential. Here was this really big, athletic midfielder who was mobile, had good feet, and a good first touch,” Vom Steeg said. “Once we’ve decided that he’s a forward, there is a set of skills that you need to work on in order to be a good forward. My job as a coach is to keep pushing him and keep encouraging him that the sky’s the limit.”</p>\n<p>Another huge contributing factor has been the play of DePuy’s supporting cast, particularly during this season. A couple of left-footed forwards in sophomore Ahinga Selemani and freshman Geoffrey Acheampong have joined DePuy atop the Big West stat charts, with the former ranking third in shots and the latter tied for the conference lead in assists with seven.</p>\n<p>“We’ve created a pretty good environment for [the players],” Vom Steeg said. “Nick doesn’t get those chances if he doesn’t have good players around him. He’s got Ahinga working hard for him, he’s got service coming, and now he just needs to keep doing his part.”</p>\n<p>Up next for DePuy and UCSB is a huge game against Cal Poly this Saturday. Sitting in first place in the standings, the Gauchos will be relying on their superstar to bring them the postseason glory they have worked all year for.</p>\n<p>Win or lose, though, DePuy will continue to be fueled by his competitive fire and the desire to play the game he loves.</p>\n<p>“I’m loving my time at UCSB right now,” he said. “I’m loving the soccer, too. I enjoy it every time I play.”</p>\n<p>Whatever happens down the stretch of this season, one thing is for sure: we’re all just lucky that he’s only a junior.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65665\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65665\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/","id":1481,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1480,1479,1478],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":13,"route":"/authors/63"}},"__N_SSG":true}
