While the Highlanders’ offense has only managed to compile a .119 kill percentage as a team, they do boast one of the conference’s top liberos in Maddie Hubbell. Although she’s just a freshman, Hubbell is third in the Big West with an average of 3.93 digs per set.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important for us to just stay focused on treating these opponents like we would treat any other opponents,” senior outside hitter Leah Sully said. “We need to treat every opponent like they’re going to give us their best.”</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos travel to play Fullerton, they will be looking for ways to dissect a strong Titan defense that leads the Big West with 17.72 digs per set. UCSB will also be busy trying to stop junior setter Julie Consani, whose 10.84 assists per set is good for third in the conference.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working on our defense every day,” Thompson said. “We feel like we can win a lot of long rallies, so we’re trying to be error-free offensively and keep moving our feet to the ball.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have the second-lowest amount of errors in the Big West this year, something that has benefited them greatly. Their offense is by no means overly prolific, as they are second to last in both kills and assists per set, but they have found ways to win nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Thompson has been a dominant hitter all year, averaging 3.45 kills per set and freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt has made an excellent impact defensively. Her 1.08 blocks per set are fourth best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The match against Riverside will begin Friday at 7 p.m. and the Gauchos will close out their weekend against Fullerton on Saturday at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of October 24, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/gauchos-take-five-game-win-streak-on-the-road/","id":5277,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5276,5275,5274],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Down But Never Out: Leah Sully Battles Back from Injury","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Leah Sully Battled Back From a Torn ACL","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There are a select few injuries in sports that every athlete can only hope they never have to experience. Breaking bones can be pretty bad, and rupturing an Achilles can end your career, but one of the more common dreaded injuries is a torn ACL. The increasingly prevalent season-ending knee injury can happen to anyone at anytime, ending a promising season or even a career in a flash.</p>\n<p>Some players never come back from tearing their ACL. Those who do usually find it difficult to perform at the same level they did prior to the injury. Players tend to come back a little slow at first, and it usually takes some time before anyone can really say what long-term effects the injury has had on them.</p>\n<p>Leah Sully, co-captain of the UCSB women’s volleyball team, is one of those players who didn’t play at the same level she was at before tearing her ACL.

She was third on the team with 223 kills and led the entire Big West with 52 service aces. In the only NCAA tournament appearance of her college career against St. Mary’s, she posted a then-career-high 20 digs.</p>\n<p>“Her first year she was a tremendous impact player,” Gregory said. “Her hitting was good, but that wasn’t the most important thing. She was a great all-around player. Her passing, defense and serving were what was really good.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the first match of her sophomore season, Leah came down with the injury that ended her year just as it began.</p>\n<p>“It was tough because I was excited to have a good season and it’s just a hard thing to cope with in the beginning,” Sully said. “Once I got over that initial hump though, I was just trying to work hard at rehab and push myself to get back as quick as I could.”</p>\n<p>Her coach, however, looked only at the positives that she believed would come from an injury of such magnitude.</p>\n<p>“As difficult as it is to go through an injury, there’s always a silver lining,” Gregory said. “She sat out a year and her hitting got better and better, and by the last year I coached she was the go-to hitter. She really developed her all-around game.”</p>\n<p>While most athletes fear that knee injuries will hinder their physical abilities in a more general sense, when it comes to a sport like volleyball, players and coaches are more concerned with one thing in particular: jumping. Sully made it a point to battle her way into peak physical form before the start of the next season and prove that that would not be an issue.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to improve my vertical,” Sully said. “That was the biggest thing, and I ended up gaining two inches when I came back to the team.”</p>\n<p>Since coming back from her injury, Sully has led the Gauchos in total kills, digs and aces, further solidifying her reputation as an all-around player. She has earned All-Big West First Team honors, she’s placed her name all over the UCSB record books, and she will surely hit many more statistical milestones before her time is done. Despite all of these accomplishments though, there are still a few goals that have continued to elude her.</p>\n<p>“Obviously I would like to go as far in NCAA as possible,” Sully said. “But a Big West title would be huge.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a difficult preseason this year, going 5-7, but they received some bad news before their first conference game of the season when an MRI showed that Sully had a sprained ligament in her elbow. As the team’s top outside hitter, it wasn’t a very good time for her to be forced to sit out games for the first time since her ACL tear.</p>\n<p>As a result, Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch moved Sully to libero; a position where she could play without risking further injury, but also one which she had never before started at in college. Since that decision, UCSB has gone on a tremendous 5-1 run to start their Big West campaign, highlighted by an incredible road win over No. 9 Hawaii in which Sully had a game-high 22 digs.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of what position she’s playing, she’s trying to win at everything,” Sully’s teammate senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “There’s always this intensity and heart to play 100 percent, to just leave it all out there.”</p>\n<p>Thompson perhaps knows better than anybody what Sully went through while rehabilitating her ACL because she too was sidelined for the majority of the 2009 season with a knee injury.</p>\n<p>“After she came back, her mindset completely changed, and she was more driven than ever,” Thompson said. “Her mindset is just so aggressive, she wants to win so badly and she’ll do whatever it takes and play whatever position she’s assigned to.”</p>\n<p>During her time as a Gaucho, Sully has excelled in everything she’s been tasked with doing on the court. Since tearing her ACL, she became the team’s number one hitter, she has been a calming force on the defense whether she’s playing libero or any other position, and she’s become a true leader for her teammates both on and off the court. Not surprisingly, she can owe much of her success to the time she was forced to spend off the court.</p>\n<p>“That knee injury was really inspirational for me because I had never had a serious injury before,” Sully said. “Just always having that in the back of my mind, every day when I come into practice there’s times when I think about it and how I couldn’t play for so long. It really makes you want to practice every day as hard as you can.”</p>\n<p>The silver lining that Coach Gregory foresaw may just be the reason why Leah Sully has, and will continue to be one of the best women’s volleyball players that UCSB has ever been lucky to call a Gaucho.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52583\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52583\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/","id":3230,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3229,3228,3227],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes Down Top Big West Team Again","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_03.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_03.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Northridge 3-1, UC Davis 3-2 at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Riding the momentum of a three match winning streak, the UCSB women’s volleyball team continued its hot run this past weekend with a pair of wins over Cal State Northridge and UC Davis.</p>\n<p>For the second consecutive weekend, UCSB defeated the top team in the Big West, dropping Northridge to 16-4 overall and 6-1 in conference.

However, despite winning the set by a score of 25-20, the Gauchos allowed the Aggies to go on a run of their own and gain momentum going into the next two sets.</p>\n<p>Momentum in hand, UC Davis used strong blocking to keep up with UCSB in the second game. Trailing 17-18, the Aggies went on an 8-2 run to win the set 25-20. The next set got even worse for the Gauchos as Davis took advantage of numerous UCSB errors, and therefore took a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Needing a comeback, Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch made a crucial change by moving Sully from libero back to her favored position at outside hitter. The result was only positive for UCSB as Sully, who was already well on her way to a season high 25 digs, turned the game around with nine kills in the final two sets on an incredible .643 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>“We were a little bit out of sorts; I felt like we needed a change and it was a gamble,” Lantagne Welch said. “[We] just jumped on it and it gave us a ton of momentum.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos stole momentum back from Davis in the fourth set, winning 25-20 to even the match. Entering the fifth set, UCSB finished off the Aggies 15-11, capped off by another winner by Sully.</p>\n<p>Making a big difference for UCSB was Barbeau, who ended the game with 19 kills and six digs. Thompson and freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt led the defense with nine and eight blocks, respectively.</p>\n<p>In Friday’s match against Northridge, the Gauchos came in confident after defeating No. 10 Hawaii just a week earlier.</p>\n<p>UCSB made quick work of CSUN, using a balanced offensive attack to win the first two sets 25-22 and 25-19. The Gauchos then finished off the Matadors 25-15 for a 3-0 sweep.</p>\n<p>“It’s extremely rewarding because it’s tough to play a match after you have such a big emotional win like [Hawaii],” Lantagne Welch said. “For us to come in so prepared and really take it to a team that’s been very hot, I’m very proud of the team for that.”</p>\n<p>Freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt led the way with 12 kills and nine digs. She also hit at an impressive .375 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>Next weekend, UCSB heads to UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52548\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52548\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-takes-down-top-big-west-team-again/","id":5276,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5275,5274,5273],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Seek Win Against Top Team in the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_Sept27_11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"preview women's volleyball against Cal State Northridge, UC Davis","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off what is undoubtedly its biggest win of the season in Hawaii, the UCSB women’s volleyball team returns home this weekend to host Big West leader Cal State Northridge and UC Davis.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, now at 8-8 overall, 3-1 in the Big West and in sole possession of third place in the conference, will be looking to ride the momentum of an impressive three-match winning streak heading into Friday’s match against Northridge.

The loss dropped the Rainbow Wahine from No. 3 in the nation to No. 10.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely feeling confident,” senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “We feel that since we did take down one of the biggest teams in the nation our abilities are unlimited right now.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB is going to be able to take down the conference’s top team for the second weekend in a row, they will likely have to follow the same winning formula that they have found in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>The key player in this formula has been Thompson, whose performance in one of the most important games of her senior year against Hawaii could go down as her best ever. The team’s leading scorer all year, Thompson ended the game with a career-high 26 points that included 19 kills and 11 blocks on her way to earning her first-ever Big West Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge honor, but obviously I didn’t do it all by myself,” Thompson said. “We had a huge team effort in beating Hawaii; they definitely helped me receive the award.”</p>\n<p>Senior Leah Sully has also been a huge part in the team’s recent wins, and not in the way she has been in the past. The team has gone 3-1 ever since Sully’s move from outside hitter to libero, and she has compiled 20 digs twice during the stretch.</p>\n<p>Northridge boasts the second-most prolific offense in the conference, only behind Hawaii, averaging 13.94 kills per set on a 0.274 kill percentage. However, the Gauchos only need to look to last weekend, when they held Hawaii to a 0.111 kill percentage, to feel good about their chances defensively.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working a lot on our blocking, so hopefully [it] carries over from the Hawaii match,” Thompson said. “If we keep an aggressive mindset we’ll be able to come out on top.”</p>\n<p>One of the Matador’s top contributors on the offensive side will be senior setter Sydney Gedryn, who is currently third in the Big West at 10.57 assists per set.</p>\n<p>“[Gedryn] is very physical,” Thompson said. “We’re definitely going to have to take care of her and also make sure that we take care of their pin hitters.”</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos will be busy trying to beat a defense led by junior libero Megan Lancaster that leads the conference in digs. Sophomore outside hitter Kaylin Sguyres will also be a player to watch out for as she leads the Aggies with 3.08 kills per set this year.</p>\n<p>“[Sguyres] is a strong right side so we definitely need to watch out for her,” Thompson said. “But once again blocking and our defense are the two aspects that we need to focus on [against Davis].”</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts Northridge on Friday and UC Davis on Saturday. Both games will be played at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of October 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52514\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52514\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/gauchos-seek-win-against-top-team-in-the-big-west/","id":5312,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5311,5310,5309],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Defeat No. 3 Hawaii on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W_VBall_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W_VBall_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Hawaii for the first time since 1994.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team headed into a road game against No. 3 Hawaii with loads of confidence and the belief that they could compete with any team in the country.

Down 14-8, the Rainbow Wahine put together three straight points, but that would be the only stretch in the first set where they scored on consecutive serves. The Gauchos stayed strong and eventually won the set at 25-20, after a Hawaii service error.</p>\n<p>The second set began even better than the first for UCSB as it took advantage of several Hawaii errors on the way to a 6-1 lead. Later in the set, a kill by senior opposite Katey Thompson made it 14-6, the largest lead of the night for either team.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine fought back, eventually making it a 21-19 game after an attacking error by Thompson. The Gauchos answered back though, by scoring four of the next five points to win the set 25-20 and take a 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara started off the third set strong after three straight Hawaii attacking errors, including two blocks from Thompson, gave UCSB a 5-3 lead. However, plagued by service and attacking errors, UCSB found itself facing a 20-13 deficit. Senior outside hitter Emily Hartong put it away for Hawaii with a kill to win the set 25-21 and cut the Gauchos lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>Hartong was the only Rainbow Wahine player in double digits in kills on from the night with 20.</p>\n<p>Hawaii took its momentum into the fourth set as they took an early 7-2 lead. Both teams traded runs throughout, but the Rainbow Wahine ended up prevailing 25-22 after a second straight set-winning kill by Hartong.</p>\n<p>Despite losing the previous two sets, UCSB did not lose its composure. Tied 10-10, a kill by freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt put the Gauchos up 11-10 and they did not look back. Leading 14-12, a block by Thompson and freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt sealed the 3-2 upset.</p>\n<p>Thompson once again led the way for UCSB with 10 block assists and 19 kills, both team-highs, while Spindt added a double-double with 12 kills and 17 digs. Senior Leah Sully played excellently at libero as she contributed 22 digs, both a game high and a personal season high.</p>\n<p>UCSB looks to continue its great stretch when it hosts Big West leader Cal State Northridge and UC Davis next weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 14, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Hawaii’s only loss this year came against No. 8 San Diego, but the Rainbow Wahine have since gone on a 13-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons they have been able to dominate is because there isn’t anything they’re not good at. Hawaii owns the Big West’s leaders in kills, digs and assists per set. Although the Gauchos don’t boast the record or statistics that a team like Hawaii does, they are confident in their ability to compete this weekend.</p>\n<p>“We’re really going to have to stay focused and disciplined to beat Hawaii,” senior outside hitter Katey Thompson said. “We really want to and that’s a huge part of it. If we play our best volleyball then I really believe we can come away with a win.”</p>\n<p>If they’re going to be able to get the win, the Gauchos will have to try and find an answer for senior outside hitter Emily Hartong; something no team has done yet this season. Hartong leads the way with 259 kills and a .308 kill percentage. Setting her up is senior setter Mita Uiato, who leads the conference with 10.91 assists per set.</p>\n<p>If Hawaii’s offense wasn’t already enough to deal with, its defense is tops in the Big West as well. Senior libero Ali Longo leads the conference with 230 digs and junior middle hitter Kalei Adolpho adds another dimension with her ability to contribute both offensively and defensively. Adolpho’s .423 hitting percentage and 1.09 blocks per set put her at second and fifth in the Big West, respectively.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to take a lot of hard work,” sophomore setter Hanna Nielson said. “We’ve been practicing really hard so we just need to figure out our passing and continue to be aggressive on defense. If we put everything together we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, they will need to continue relying on Thompson, whose 3.51 kills per set are good for second in the conference. Freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt has been playing excellently as well, and is second on the team in kills with 145.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to play extremely well, but I know one thing about this team is they rise to every challenge,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “There’s not one team in the country that we can’t play with, so we’re looking forward to it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has won two straight conference games thanks to solid team play and contributions from every player on the court. Perhaps the most important contribution though has come from Sully, who recently made the switch from outside hitter to libero.</p>\n<p>Despite only starting the last three matches at libero, she is fifth in the conference in digs with 188 and third on the team in kills with 136.</p>\n<p>“Last year we didn’t have a great match there so a lot of people are ready to come out and get some revenge on them,” Sully said.</p>\n<p>The match starts Saturday at 7:00 p.m. in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/ucsb-takes-on-undefeated-no-3-hawaii-on-the-road/","id":5309,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5308,5307,5306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Defeat Rival Cal Poly 3-1","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_102012-6.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WVolleyball_102012-6.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's volleyball defeats rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the season’s first chapter of the Blue-Green Rivalry, the UCSB women’s volleyball team came away with a 3-1 victory over Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos improved to 7-8 overall and are now tied for third in the Big West with a 2-1 conference record.

However, the Mustangs took advantage of some costly UCSB errors and won the set 27-25.</p>\n<p>“We realized the [in] first game we caused a lot of errors on our side and that helped them win,” Thompson said. “After we took care of those [errors] it was a lot easier for us to be in system and execute when we needed to.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos trailed for much of the second set, but with the score tied at 20-20, they were able to score four straight points and pull away. A block by sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau and freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg gave the Gauchos a 25-22 win and tied the match at 1-1.</p>\n<p>“We were resilient,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We made some little adjustments, we cleaned up our side and put a little more pressure on them and that’s what we needed to do.”</p>\n<p>The third set was over before it began for Cal Poly as UCSB jumped out to a quick 7-2 lead. Spindt eventually finished it off with a kill to make it 25-16 and give the Gauchos a 2-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>UCSB again found itself trailing in the fourth set 16-13, but once again they made a run and took a 22-19 lead. Sophomore opposite Jaylen Villanueva ended the game with a kill to make it 25-22 and give the Gauchos a 3-1 win.</p>\n<p>“Throughout the season so far we’ve kind of been a comeback team and we’ve had a lot of slow starts,” senior outside hitter Leah Sully said. “I think everyone on the team knows that we’re capable of making that push at the end.”</p>\n<p>Spindt continued a stretch of fantastic performances with 13 digs and a career-high 17 kills. Thompson also stayed consistent with 16 kills of her own. Sophomore setter Hanna Nielson added a double-double with 27 assists and 14 digs.</p>\n<p>“We kept our composure really well,” Thompson said. “We just knew what we had to do and [we] know regardless of what the score is, it’s not over until it hits 25.”</p>\n<p>The win is the Gauchos’ second straight overall and fourth in a row over Cal Poly, dating back to 2011.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a trip to No. 6 Hawaii, which will take place on Saturday at 7 p.m. in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article appeared on page 6 of  October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52338\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52338\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/gauchos-defeat-rival-cal-poly-3-1/","id":5279,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5278,5277,5276],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host First Place Cal Poly in Blue-Green Rivarly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-VBall-Shaminder-Dhindsa.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-VBall-Shaminder-Dhindsa.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's volleyball preview vs. Cal Poly","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team finishes off a three-game home stand this weekend with the season’s first installment of the blue-green rivalry.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter Saturday’s game with a 6-8 overall record and at 1-1 Big West mark.

While she has consistently led the team in kills, Sully’s temporary move to libero comes at a crucial time during the season as the team continues searching for answers in their rotation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a bummer not having [Leah] hitting because she’s such a great asset to the team, but she’s doing a great job at [playing libero],” Thompson said. “She’s been one of our big hitters this entire year, so that definitely puts some pressure on the other outside hitters who are filling her shoes.”</p>\n<p>That pressure didn’t seem to faze the Gauchos’ hitters in their dominant victory over Irvine last weekend, as they finished off an astounding .394 percent of their kill attempts. Behind a strong team attack, five players end up with five or more kills, the most they’ve had in any three-set game this season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had to be more balanced,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We’ve played an extremely tough schedule and [gained] a lot of experience from that. ”</p>\n<p>The players most responsible for filling in for Sully as outside hitter are freshman Ali Spindt and sophomore Ali Barbeau, who had 26 and 20 kills, respectively, in the two games last weekend.</p>\n<p>“They’re doing really well,” Thompson said of the other outside hitters. “They’re young so they don’t have as much experience as Leah does but they’re definitely stepping up.”</p>\n<p>Thompson continues to dominate the position with a team-high 3.46 kills per set, well ahead of Sully’s second-highest of 2.47.</p>\n<p>The rival Mustangs were able to do what UCSB couldn’t do and defeat the 19ers last weekend. Their duo of senior outside hitters Chelsea Hardin and Megan McConnell lead another well-balanced attack with each averaging over three kills per set.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos are not as worried about Cal Poly’s attack as they are about their defense.</p>\n<p>“We know that Cal Poly is a very strong, defensive team,” Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Mustangs face off at 7 p.m. this weekend in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of Oct. 3rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52315\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52315\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/gauchos-host-first-place-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivarly/","id":5262,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5261,5260,5259],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes 1-1 at Home To Open Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W_Vball_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W_Vball_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team went 1-1 this past weekend in what was both their first home and Big West games of the season.

However, after a timeout, UCSB scored three straight points and ended up dominating the majority of the game.</p>\n<p>After breezing through the first set 25-19 and winning the second set 25-21, the Gauchos met their biggest test of the night in the third set. The Gauchos were able to prevail off a kill by senior outside hitter Katey Thompson, ending the set with a score of 26-24 and the game 3-0.</p>\n<p>“It was really important for us to get this win,” sophomore opposite Jaylen Villanueva said. “We just came out today with so much fire and so much intensity and we’re really excited for this win.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way for UCSB were Thompson and freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt with 10 kills each, while freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg added five kills and the team’s only block. Spindt also led the way with 14 digs as she continues to excel in just her first year with the team.</p>\n<p>“We kept our energy high on the court and we were able to shake off the balls that we missed,” Villanueva said.</p>\n<p>The first conference win of the season came on the heels of a tough loss to Long Beach on Friday night. In the fifth and final set, UCSB found itself tied 12-12 with the 49ers before conceding three of the final four points and losing the match 3-2.</p>\n<p>Thompson and Spindt led the way for the offense in this one as well, with 23 and 16 kills, respectively, and sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau added 13 kills of her own. Senior Leah Sully made her first start of the season at libero, and she led the team with 20 digs.</p>\n<p>“Leah’s a great ball hander and unfortunately it’s putting her in a position where she has to pass the ball a lot for us,” Lantagne Welch said. “Tonight we just had incredible offensive production, hitting close to .400 as a team with so many players contributing, so that was definitely a credit to our passers, our setting and our hitters to be smart when attacking.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ends its home stand on Saturday when it hosts rival Cal Poly. The game will begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52225\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52225\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/","id":5308,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5307,5306,5305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Big West Play vs. Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Vball-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Vball-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With a new coach and a new system, there have been a lot of firsts for the UCSB women’s volleyball team this season.

Long Beach State has started 7-6, while the Anteaters are sitting comfortably above .500 at 9-5.</p>\n<p>While a 5-7 start is not necessarily a dream for the Gauchos, they are hoping their preseason tune-up games and weekly practices will help them get off to a strong start in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“This entire week has just been focused on game time situations and how to finish big points,” Sherrard said. “That’s something that we were trying to focus on in the preseason tournaments. We know Long Beach pretty well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have had a lot of changes since the end of last season, first with the departure of long-time head coach Kathy Gregory and next with the introduction of six new freshmen to the team.</p>\n<p>Replacing Gregory is new head coach Nicole Lantagne Welch, who is coming off a very successful stint at the University of Miami.</p>\n<p>Besides the drastic change at head coach, there have been big changes all over the roster. Most notable of these changes is the departure of last year’s standout freshman libero Taylor Formico, who broke the school and Big West record for digs.</p>\n<p>“[Formico] did leave a pretty big hole,” Sherrard said. “We realized it was a big change, but we all just came together and figured out a way to get past [losing her].”</p>\n<p>The team also brought in six new freshmen, a couple of which have already made a positive impact on the court. Freshmen middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg lead the team in blocks with 37 and 32, respectively.</p>\n<p>Offensively, freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt has really hit stride early in the season, and is tied for the second most kills on the team with 102.</p>\n<p>“[Spindt] has already made a really big impact,” Sherrard said. “She’s one of our go-to [players] when it comes to kills.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Hanna Nielson, who was the Gauchos’ starting setter last season, has gotten off to a good start with 316 assists after just 12 games.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays Long Beach State in the Thunderdome at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, and UC Irvine at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/","id":5306,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5305,5304,5303],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Ready for Season Under New Head Coach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a disappointing record last season, women's volleyball is starting off a new season with coach Nicole Lantagne Welch at the helm.

After being picked No. 4 in the preseason coaches’ poll, the Gauchos ended up finishing tied for fifth in the Big West with a conference record of 9-9 and an overall 16-17 record.<br>\nLuckily for UCSB, this will be a completely new season with a very different looking team.<br>\nThis year marks a new beginning for UCSB volleyball as for the first time in 38 seasons Kathy Gregory will not be the team’s head coach. The legendary Gaucho coach, who holds the school record for winning percentage (.681) and won the AVCA National Coach of the Year award in 1993, retired after last season.<br>\nTaking Gregory’s place at the helm is Nicole Lantagne Welch, who is coming off a 25-6 season and a trip to the NCAA tournament at the University of Miami last season. During her time at Miami, Welch compiled a 243-120 record, giving her an impressive .669 winning percentage.<br>\nThe Gauchos come into this season as the No. 6 team in the Big West, as voted by the coaches. The biggest roster change for them will be in the middle, as standout libero Taylor Formico will not be returning to the team.<br>\nAs a freshman last season, Formico broke the school record for digs on her way to being named the Big West Freshman of the Year and earning a First Team All-Big West selection.<br>\nUCSB’s only other departure in the offseason was another libero in graduated senior Erica Lau. Filling in at the defensive specialist position will be sophomore Shauna Klein, backed by a couple of newcomers in freshmen Ella Roberts and Helen Gannon.<br>\nUCSB is looking strong on the wings with opposite Katey Thompson and outside hitters Leah Sully and Kara Sherrard all entering their senior years. Sully and Thompson were named to the First and Second Team Honorable Mention All-Big West last season, respectively. Despite having only three seniors on the team, the Gauchos will have plenty of solid veteran leadership.<br>\nThe remaining four incoming freshmen include outside hitter Ali Spindt and middle blockers Phoebe Grunt, Allie Sullberg and Kristen Berlo. Berlo, a double athlete who is also on the UCSB softball team, should be an exciting prospect to watch next season as she and the other freshmen compete for playing time.<br>\nAt setter, the Gauchos will welcome the return of junior Ali Santi, who led the team with 8.28 assists per game in 2012. Sophomores Jaylen Villanueva and Hanna Nielson will back Santi up as the only other setters on the team.<br>\nRounding out the roster are two liberos in Klein and junior Keely Stevenson, and three middle blockers in sophomores Britton Taylor and Elizabeth “ZZ” Meddaugh and junior Jordan Pehanick.<br>\nUCSB may have been predicted to finish in the bottom half of the Big West this year, but with a number of fresh new faces on the team and a strong core of upperclassmen, the team could very well make some noise in the conference.<br>\nThe Gauchos open their season this Friday against volleyball powerhouse Stanford. The game will be played at noon at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51814\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51814\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/","id":5305,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5304,5303,5302],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Recapping the NBA Offseason’s Biggest Storylines","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/NBA_Logo.svg_.png?resize=254%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/NBA_Logo.svg_.png?resize=254%2C545&ssl=1","description":"Every year, between the NBA finals in June and the beginning of the preseason in October, basketball fans are forced to suffer.

After years of preparation, teams get their chance to reshape their rosters and hopefully reel in some of the league’s top talent.<br>\nRecent off-seasons have not disappointed. In 2010, we were all witnesses to the infamous “Decision,” where after months of speculation, LeBron James told the world he would be taking his talents to the Miami Heat along with Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.<br>\n2011 was hell on earth for NBA fans as a lockout extended the offseason an extra two months. Laker fans however will forever remember it as the year of the infamous David Stern veto, a decision that sent Chris Paul across the hall to the Clippers locker room instead of the Lakers.’<br>\n2012 was the year of the “Dwightmare,” when after months of flip-flopping, Dwight Howard miraculously ended up in a Laker uniform along with Steve Nash, beginning one of the most disappointing seasons in sports history.<br>\nThe 2013 offseason has already seen multiple blockbuster deals reshape the entire NBA landscape.<br>\nThe first blockbuster came from the Celtics, who shipped off Head Coach Doc Rivers to the Clippers to replace Vinny del Negro, while Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce were sent to the Brooklyn Nets to form one of the strongest starting lineups in basketball.<br>\nThe most anticipated move of the off-season came soon after, and for the second straight offseason it involved Dwight Howard.<br>\nAfter a dreadful season with the Lakers, the one they call Superman chose to leave and join James Harden and the Houston Rockets. The move will surely add to the league’s newest rivalry between the Rockets and Harden’s old team, the Oklahoma City Thunder. The two young teams are set to dominate the western conference for years to come.<br>\nGolden State made moves to acquire Andre Iguodala from the Nuggets, adding a leadership presence to another young, rising western conference team.<br>\nThe Clippers didn’t stop after acquiring their new head coach, sending away Caron Butler and glorified backup point guard Eric Bledsoe to Phoenix for Jared Dudley and JJ Redick.<br>\nCleveland wasn’t able to fulfill Dan Gilbert’s promise of winning a championship before LeBron James did, but they might be headed in the right direction after signing former Laker center Andrew Bynum. Along with Kyrie Irving, Cleveland may have the best point guard-center combination in recent years.<br>\nThere were a few surprising moves by some of this year’s high profile free agents, starting with Josh Smith, Brandon Jennings and Chauncey Billups joining the Detroit Pistons. Monta Ellis signed with the Dallas Mavericks, Al Jefferson left Utah to join the Charlotte Bobcats, and OJ Mayo joined the Milwaukee Bucks coming off his best year yet.<br>\nNew Orleans, in their first year being known as the “Pelicans,” may also be a team on the rise after acquiring guards Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans  in separate deals.<br>\nOther than the Celtics, the NBA’s glory franchises have made only small adjustments to their teams.<br>\nThe Heat have stayed basically the same, with their biggest move being the re-signing of “The Birdman” Chris Andersen.<br>\nNew York moved some pieces around to acquire center Andrea Bargnani from the Raptors, while also re-signing J.R. Smith and guard Pablo Prigioni.<br>\nThe Lakers have moved on from the Dwight Howard saga and have made small one-year signings, including guard Nick Young and center Chris Kaman. With Steve Nash being the only contract on the books for the 2014-15 season, the Lakers are positioning themselves to bring in a star like Carmelo Anthony next summer to take the torch from the great Kobe Bryant.<br>\nWith that, nearly all of the offseason’s biggest moves are likely done. Fans will now go back to counting the days until they can see their team’s newly adjusted rosters in action.<br>\nJust two more months and normalcy shall return. Heat fans will continue to enjoy dominance, Thunder fans will be hungry to get back to the finals, Laker fans will be pretentious as always and Bulls fans… Well, Bulls fans will probably continue to wait for Derrick Rose to come back. Good old NBA.</p>\n<p><em>This story is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy of  Wikipedia.org. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/","id":3219,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3218,3217,3216],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kobe Bryant: Down But Not Out","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  For the past 17 years, the world’s best basketball players have asked the same question.

He’s going to go to the free throw line, knock down two clutch free throws, get back on defense and get us through this game. He might even limp.</p>\n<p>He did what most of us expected. He came out of the timeout, walked to the free throw line, and he made two free throws to tie the game with just over three minutes remaining. Only this time, he didn’t get back on defense. His eyes were red. It was obvious he was holding back tears. He limped off the court and into the locker room. The result was a torn Achilles tendon.</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant has pushed his body to its physical limits year after year. He has been described as more than just a basketball player, but a warrior, and often regarded as the toughest player in the NBA.</p>\n<p>So, how fitting then that the only weakness of the legendary, indestructible warrior Achilles would be the only thing that could stop the greatest warrior of this era.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, nothing made sense in Lakerland.</p>\n<p>After two depressing years in which the previously top of the world Lakers were run out of the second round of the playoffs, one of the greatest franchises in basketball had seemingly found its way back to the top by acquiring future hall of famer Steve Nash and the most dominant big man in basketball in Dwight Howard.</p>\n<p>However, the dream quickly turned into a nightmare. After a 1-4 start to a year that was supposed to be one of the greatest in the team’s glorious history, the Lakers found themselves in disarray.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to January. The Lakers are 17-25 and Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard continue to miss games with various injuries. The only constant, as he has been since 1996, is Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Then, something changed, and the Lakers started to win. Kobe would go on to have one of his greatest seasons ever, averaging over 27 points a game for the ninth time in his career, tying his career high with 6 assists per game, and shooting the ball more efficiently than he has in years.</p>\n<p>Kobe hit the winning shot against the Hawks in a must-win game. Three days later, he brought his team back from down 25 points at New Orleans, a game where his teammates once again failed to play with the fire needed to make the playoffs.</p>\n<p>He followed it up two nights later with miraculous shot after miraculous shot against Toronto, ending in another game-winning shot.</p>\n<p>With five games left in the season, Kobe vowed not to come off the court again. If the Lakers won their remaining games, they would clinch a playoff spot, something that seemed unreachable three months earlier.</p>\n<p>The Lakers won one game. The next night, they played in the Rose Garden in Portland, an arena they rarely win in. In 48 minutes, Kobe had 47 points, eight rebounds, five assists, four block shots, and three steals, becoming the first player to ever put up a stat line like that.</p>\n<p>With three games remaining, the Lakers returned home to play the Golden State Warriors. They trailed for most of the game, but with just minutes left they still had a chance. Kobe nailed a deep jumper to bring the Lakers within three with under five minutes to go.</p>\n<p>A minute later, he took a classic “Kobe shot:” a deep, 29-foot, stand-still three to tie the game with a defender in his face. He made it.</p>\n<p>The next time he touched the ball, he made his final move, one that after the game he said he’s made “a million times.” He had played every minute of every game for almost three weeks, but on this night, his body gave out on him.</p>\n<p>The Lakers would go on to win their remaining games and make it to the playoffs, where they were swept by the much superior San Antonio Spurs.</p>\n<p>Kobe underwent successful surgery to repair his achilles, and was originally diagnosed as out six to nine months. Many players never come back from this injury, and those that do have found it very difficult to perform at a high level.</p>\n<p>If there’s anyone that can do it, though, it’s Kobe Bryant. While the numbers of his dwindling number of peers who played in the ‘90s, such as Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan and Steve Nash, have fallen steadily, Kobe has somehow kept his production consistent.</p>\n<p>If there’s anything his teary-eyed interview which directly followed his injury tells us, it’s how much he cares. The undeniable, unbreakable emotion is still there. The fire, will and inhuman competitive spirit is still there.</p>\n<p>Every doubter that he’s ever had, he’s silenced. He’s stepped up to every challenge he’s been faced with since joining the league at the age of 17. In 2003, someone said that his daughter was a better shooter than Kobe. The Mamba answered that by breaking the NBA record with 12 three-pointers in a single game, a record that still stands today.</p>\n<p>That’s just who he is. He won’t stop fighting because he doesn’t know how. He already has a head-start on the recovery process by studying from the fastest recoveries from this dreaded injury and promising to “do it better.” He’s shooting for a return to the court by the end of October, the start of what just might be his final season.</p>\n<p>He will prove the doubters wrong again. He will come back not as a shell of his former self, but as formidable a force as he has ever been. He will continue to be Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of http://blackmambablog.edublogs.org</em></p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51660\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51660\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/","id":3210,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3209,3208,3207],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Softball Brings in Six New Recruits Next Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SoftballGame15_KevinYang_05.10.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SoftballGame15_KevinYang_05.10.2013.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One year after finishing just a win short of the Big West Conference title, the UCSB softball team took a step back this season as they ended with a .500 conference record and a fourth-place finish. �...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One year after finishing just a win short of the Big West Conference title, the UCSB softball team took a step back this season as they ended with a .500 conference record and a fourth-place finish.</p>\n<p>“A lot of those freshmen got game experience and they filled some pretty key roles for us,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They had some big performances, and there’s a lot of room for them to get even better physically and mentally.

The gifted 6’1” athlete has not only signed on to play pitcher aside standouts sophomore Shelby Wisdom and freshman Alex Pingree, but she will also be playing for UCSB volleyball in the fall. In her junior year, she struck out 277 batters and maintained a .429 batting average.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have five pitchers and she’ll also be playing volleyball here at UCSB too,” Galiciano said. “She can come in and make an impact right away.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos were generally solid on defense this past season, they struggled to put up runs at times. Incoming outfielder and three-time Fountain Valley Offensive Player of the Year Emily Brucelas should be able to help with the offensive woes.</p>\n<p>“It’s always a transition going from high school to travel to college, but she’ll be a hitter who can adjust playing at this level,” Galicinao said. “She’s pretty aggressive offensively and I think she’ll be pretty consistent at this level.”</p>\n<p>Another player with good potential to help on the offensive side is Texas native Kristen Clark. With a good swing and great speed, she can also help fill in the outfield, an area that was once controlled by Soria’s speed.</p>\n<p>“She’s somebody who’s fast from the right side, but she can hit for power and also play the short game,” Galicinao said. “She’s pretty softball-savvy and just an all-around athlete.”</p>\n<p>Also adding to the depth of the outfield is Sunkist League MVP Stacy Cavazos. In her senior year, she hit at an incredible .544 clip and had 54 RBI.</p>\n<p>“She’s the other fast one,” Galicinao said. “She’s a triple threat that hits from the left side and can also hit it over the fence. After she signed on, she asked what she should do. I said ‘Just stay fast,’ and she did.”</p>\n<p>While most of the other recruits are versatile players who can play multiple positions, local native utility Rieanna Thomas is the only one who will have it in her job description. As a utility, she will be able to chip in by playing multiple positions on the field.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruits is outfielder Jackie Hinojosa from Saint Francis High School. In her junior year, she had a .531 batting average and scored 22 runs.</p>\n<p>Overall, the speed and versatility of the incoming freshmen should make an instant impact.

Soria led off with a single to start things off and three batters later, Jennings hit a single to right field to bring Soria home and give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was kind of perfect in [Keilani and Jessica’s] first at bats of their last games that they were able to put up the first run,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB’s early momentum was ended in the second inning when junior outfielder Dionne Anderson tied the game off a sac fly by freshman third baseman Brittanie Akey.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders kept the pressure on with four more runs, aided by two Gaucho errors in the fourth inning to go up 5-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB stayed resilient and fought back. The Gauchos tacked on two runs in the bottom of the fourth, first by junior first baseman Lauren Boser off a single by freshman catcher Samantha Stark, and next by junior outfielder McKenzie Kane off a ground out by sophomore pitcher Shelby Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Riverside eventually pulled away in the sixth inning, scoring four runs on six hits and killing the Gauchos’ chances for a comeback. UCSB didn’t have an answer in the final two innings, losing with a final score of 9-3.</p>\n<p>“Riverside came out hitting and swinging well today and we just couldn’t match them offensively,” Galicinao said. “We didn’t have the same performances [as Friday], but offensively we could’ve come out a lot stronger today. We just couldn’t keep up.”</p>\n<p>The previous game was a much more balanced effort for the Gauchos on both sides of the ball. The team came out firing with Wisdom and Soria scoring the first two runs of the game off a double by Jennings. Junior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil followed up with a double of her own to bring Jennings home and give UCSB an early 3-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Alex Pingree was solid as she has been all year, giving up no runs and striking out four batters in five innings played.</p>\n<p>Wisdom knocked a solo homer over center field, her eighth homer of the season, and finished the game pitching the last two innings as UCSB won 5-1.</p>\n<p>“On Friday we strung hits together a little bit better,” Jennings said. “[Saturday] we just had a rough defense and didn’t get those clutch hits.”</p>\n<p>The first game of the weekend was a struggle on the offensive side for both teams, but one run by freshman outfielder Arianna Palomares in the first inning was enough to seal a 1-0 UCSB win.</p>\n<p>Wisdom was masterful in the circle, striking out nine batters and shutting out the Highlanders as she pitched a full seven innings.</p>\n<p>“We started [the weekend] out really great, we were really excited,” Jennings said. “Overall we had a pretty good weekend.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 13th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51330\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51330\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/","id":1023,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1022,1021,1020],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":11,"highestPage":13,"route":"/authors/63"}},"__N_SSG":true}
