After making a run through the midfield, the senior slipped through the Gauchos’ defense before firing a left-footed shot back across his body. The shot took a deflection off of a UCSB defender and beat freshman goalkeeper Brandon Berke, putting the Lions up 1-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, whose starting lineup was extremely hampered by injuries and suspensions, struggled to get back in the game despite outshooting LMU 9-5 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We were down five starters, so we were there with half our team,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “With that being said, we still made three or four mistakes because we just had players in the wrong position, and three or four mistakes later you’re down three goals.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense, which was already hurting due to red card suspensions for freshman Jeff Quezada and junior Dylan Murphy, was further decimated with injuries to both starting fullbacks in senior Kevin Garcia-Lopez and Drew Murphy. Garcia-Lopez will be out for about two weeks due to injury, while sophomore forward Nick DePuy picked up his fifth yellow card and will miss the Gauchos’ next game. Sophomore defender and captain Paul Ehmann did not play after officially leaving the team this past week.</p>\n<p>“Garcia-Lopez and Paul are two big losses in terms of players that were unavailable to us,” Vom Steeg said. “Murphy was at 50 percent but he should be better for Saturday. He was all banged up in the game, but he did the best he could.”</p>\n<p>LMU’s redshirt senior Craig Nitti took over in the second half as the Lions continued to take advantage of the Gauchos’ weakened back line. Nitti bended a free kick from 25 yards out around the wall in the 62nd minute, placing it just under the crossbar to give his team a 2-0 lead. Just six minutes later, the Lions’ co-captain picked up a brace on a penalty kick after sophomore midfielder Adrien Perez was taken down in the box on a breakaway. Perez eventually capped off the night with a 75th minute header to put his team up 4-0.</p>\n<p>“We just didn’t have enough players and we ran out of defenders,” Vom Steeg said. “In order to win college games you have to have your whole team there, and we didn’t do enough from a defensive standpoint to win a game like that.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the night outshooting LMU 12-11, but the goalkeeping duo of Berke and sophomore Josh McNeely just couldn’t stop a very hot Lions offense. However, the Gauchos are not dwelling on the loss, instead focusing on looking forward to their next conference match.</p>\n<p>“The result itself didn’t feel good, but we’re still thinking more about Saturday and getting our players back,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos will end their current four-game stretch of road games when they play at UC Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/gauchos-road-slump-continues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/gauchos-road-slump-continues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/gauchos-road-slump-continues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/gauchos-road-slump-continues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/gauchos-road-slump-continues/","id":1559,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1558,1557,1556],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take A Break From Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB travels to LMU to take on the Lions.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_56507\" style=\"width: 348px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-28.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"300091825\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56862\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56507\" data-attachment-id=\"56507\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/this-week-in-photos-sept-28-oct-6/msoccer_vsuci-20141004-dustinharris-28/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-28.jpg?fit=5244%2C3504&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5244,3504\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412456230\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"115\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-28\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-28.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-28.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56507 \" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-28-1024x684.jpg?resize=338%2C226\" alt=\"Tortillas always had a special place in UCSB's heart.

A loss to Cal State Fullerton and a tie with UC Riverside has put the Gauchos in a less-than-ideal position, but they know that they have plenty of time to fix their season.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to win every game and we’re still not out of it,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re in a situation where we have two more road games and I’m hoping that we will go back on Tuesday night to putting the ball on the ground, playing the way we want to play and moving in that direction again.”</p>\n<p>With the conference season in full swing, it seemed that UCSB had found its groove offensively at the perfect time but it has struggled in recent games, averaging less than one goal per game over the last three.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for the Gauchos are sophomore midfielder Nick DePuy and sophomore left back Drew Murphy, who lead their team with nine points apiece. Murphy is tied for the Big West lead with five assists and has tallied two goals on the year, while DePuy leads the team with four goals. However, the team knows that offensive production will have to come from other players.</p>\n<p>“[Freshman midfielder] Axel Mendez and [freshman forward] Ludwig Ahl played about ten minutes on Saturday because, I’ll be honest, Saturday was just not a game we could trap and pass,” Vom Steeg said. “We should be able to get those players back on the field on Tuesday and find a rhythm and move the ball around.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos enter Tuesday in search of a bounce-back victory, it won’t be easy going against a very hot Loyola Marymount side. The Lions have outscored opponents by a total of 9-2 in their last four outings while picking up a pair of shutouts.</p>\n<p>Offensively, LMU is powered by a pair of midfielders in sophomore Adrien Perez and senior Sebastian De Rada, who each have ten total points on the season. De Rada comes into tonight’s game leading his team with four assists while Perez has a team-high four goals.</p>\n<p>Both teams have seen a similar split in playtime this season at the goalkeeper position. Santa Barbara’s freshman goalkeeper Brandon Berke earned the starting spot after going 4-0 while filling in for injured sophomore Josh McNeely, but after going winless and giving up three goals this past weekend, the Gauchos might be seeing a switch back to the more experienced McNeely.</p>\n<p>In the net for the Lions is a stellar pair of junior keepers in Vince Paldino and Paul Blanchette. The duo have conceded just ten total goals this year, giving their team a GAA (goals against average) of just 0.85.</p>\n<p>“For two days we had to play a different kind of soccer game,” Vom Steeg said. “We couldn’t do what we want to do or what is going to lead to success, and hopefully tonight we’ll go back to that.”</p>\n<p>The matchup between these two teams has been dominated in recent years by Santa Barbara, with its last loss to LMU coming in upset fashion all the way back in 2009.</p>\n<p>The game will be played tonight at 7:00 p.m. at Sullivan Field in Los Angeles.</p><div

last weekend, the UCSB men’s soccer team couldn’t keep its hot start going as it lost 2-0 to Cal State Fullerton on Thursday before drawing 1-1 with UC Riverside on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The winless weekend moves the Gauchos into a three-way tie for first place in the North Division at 6-4-2 overall and 2-1-1 Big West. Fullerton now owns sole possession of second place in the South Division at 6-5-2 overall, 2-2 Big West, while the Highlanders are now in third place in the South at 2-8-2 overall and 1-2-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>“Our team played really hard and competed, but the Big West conference is a tough conference to go on the road,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We would’ve liked to have found a way to win one of those two games but the team played really hard. It was just a difficult situation and I thought we did the most we could with what we had.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although the Highlanders came into the game an outmatched team compared to the overall talent of the Gauchos, they found success with a gameplan centered around sending long balls into the box and doing whatever they could to keep UCSB from finding any sort of rhythm.</p>\n<p>“It’s tough because the two teams we played against were not necessarily interested in trapping and passing,” Vom Steeg said. “They were more interested in bringing in seven, eight, nine subs and just basically throwing balls in the box and trying to get something from nothing.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders got off to a great start when in the 17th minute, Titan senior defender Otis Earle played a ball into the box that found senior forward Ulises Mosqueda for a header past freshman goalkeeper Brandon Berke, giving Riverside a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want a game in which both teams just kick it back and forth. If we get into that kind of game then it takes away from what we do well,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re just having to learn the difference between playing at Harder Stadium and playing on the road. Our players just have to play a little bit quicker and work a little bit harder in terms of committing to try and keep the ball and move it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to end a long scoring drought in the 53rd minute when sophomore midfielder Ismaila Jome sent in a cross that found senior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez for a first-touch shot. Lopez was able to fire the ball past junior goalkeeper Ashkan Khosravi to give Santa Barbara its first goal in over three halves and its first of the weekend.</p>\n<p>A second yellow card given to freshman defender Jeff Quezada in the 74th minute put the Gauchos at a disadvantage down one man, but things got even worse in the 85th minute when junior holding midfielder Dylan Murphy was given a straight red.</p>\n<p>Heading into overtime two men down, UCSB was somehow able to stave off the Riverside offense despite being outshot 8-1 in the 25 minutes after the second red card was given. After two scoreless extra periods, the game ended in a 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>“Given what happened on Thursday, I was very happy that we did have a real good response under difficult circumstances on Saturday,” Vom Steeg said. “Given that it was nine versus eleven for about thirty minutes it was pretty remarkable to be honest. We would not have tied on Saturday being two men down if we didn’t learn something from Thursday night.”</p>\n<p>In Thursday’s game against Fullerton, a frustrated Gauchos team couldn’t find a way to get on the board with only two shots on goal out of ten attempts. The game got off to a slow start, especially after being delayed 45 minutes due to Fullerton’s women’s soccer team going into double overtime, and the Gauchos failed to record a shot on goal in the first half.</p>\n<p>The Titans finally got things going with a goal in the 42nd minute. A long throw-in by forward Nigel Patterson got knocked around in the box before freshman midfielder Robert Coronado was able to control it and chip it past Berke to put his team up by one.</p>\n<p>With UCSB pushing players up the field in search of a late equalizer, the Gauchos found themselves vulnerable to a counterattack. The Titans capitalized on this in the 82nd minute when a counter led to a deep shot by senior midfielder Spencer Johnson. An outnumbered UCSB defense failed to reach the ball after it came off the post, resulting in an easy rebound goal by sophomore defender Mitchell Bell.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, they had success against us on Thursday because we did not play well at all,” Vom Steeg said. “You have to ask yourself, ‘Is the success about the way they were playing or is the success about how we didn’t handle what they were doing very well?’ and I actually think it’s a combination of both. Fullerton didn’t have a lot of interest in making that a soccer game and we didn’t really respond well to that. ”</p>\n<p>Sophomore midfielder Nick DePuy led UCSB with five out of the team’s ten shots in the game. The disappointing loss marks the first time the Gauchos have lost in the conference since 2012, ending their  impressive 12-game unbeaten streak.

These two games are even bigger than last week’s and we’ve just got to continue to let this thing roll.”</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the Gauchos head to Fullerton to play a Titan squad that has gotten off to a rough start to conference play. Garrett Losee has scored three goals to lead a respectable offense that has averaged 1.27 goals per game.</p>\n<p>“People say that they’re 0-2 and this and that, but at the end of the day any team in our conference can beat anyone,” Murphy said. “Our gameplan has to be the same gameplan we always have: we’ve got to go out there and work harder than they do, have a little bit of fortune on our side and hopefully a couple goals go in.”</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB will be a Riverside team that has managed to get off to a solid 1-1 start in the conference despite an awful preseason. The Highlanders have been shut out in five out of their last six games and have really struggled against higher quality teams.</p>\n<p>In its two wins this season over Pacific and Sacramento State, Riverside outscored opponents 9-1, compared to being outscored 11-2 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We have a situation where I think we’ve played the best two teams on paper in the conference and now we’re going to two teams that have struggled,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Now you have to take the same energy and commitment to winning on the road. You have to be really cautious when you have a young team, because you can easily give up games quickly if you don’t do all the right things.”</p>\n<p>A slow start to the season hasn’t stopped this young UCSB team from adding to what is now a 12-game unbeaten streak in conference games dating back to the beginning of last season. The Gauchos have been able to accomplish this thanks to several key lineup changes made by Vom Steeg, including moving sophomore Nick DePuy to starting forward and sophomore Murphy to left back.</p>\n<p>“At 2-3-1 [overall], we were giving up goals and not scoring goals and we kept trying to find a combination that would be better.” Vom Steeg said. “We just kind of went with Drew at left back and we put Nick up front because we felt that’s what we needed and next thing you know those two are serving it to each other and winning games for us.”</p>\n<p>Both players have shined in their new roles. DePuy has scored three game-winning goals in the last four games and was named National Player of the Week by College Soccer News and Big West Offensive Player of the Week this week. Murphy, who leads the entire conference with five assists, earned the Big West Defensive Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>Another key change came as the result of an injury to starting sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely, which thrust freshman Brandon Berke into the starting role.</p>\n<p>Berke has gone a perfect 4-0 in the first four starts of his career while averaging a goals against average (GAA) of just 0.5, good for second best in the conference. He has also provided the Gauchos with their only two shutouts of the season, which includes the 1-0 win over a powerful Irvine side last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s game with Fullerton will begin at 8:00 p.m. at Titan Stadium. On Saturday, the Gauchos travel to UC Riverside Soccer Stadium for a 7:00 p.m. game.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of October 9, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56669\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/gauchos-look-to-keep-unbeaten-streak-alive/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56669\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/gauchos-look-to-keep-unbeaten-streak-alive/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/gauchos-look-to-keep-unbeaten-streak-alive/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/gauchos-look-to-keep-unbeaten-streak-alive/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/gauchos-look-to-keep-unbeaten-streak-alive/","id":1553,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1552,1551,1550],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Start Perfect for Second Year Running","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men's soccer team defeated No. 3 UC Irvine and CSUN on it's way to a 2-0 start to Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_56500\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-251.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1596084966\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56457\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56500\" data-attachment-id=\"56500\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/msoccer_vsuci-20141004-dustinharris-25-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-251.jpg?fit=3816%2C3090&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3816,3090\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412456029\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"170\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-251.jpg?fit=250%2C202&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-251.jpg?fit=888%2C719&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-56500\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-251-1024x829.jpg?resize=888%2C719\" alt=\"UCSB freshman goalie Brandon Burke is warmly greeted by fans after the Gauchos shut out No. 3 UC Irvine 1-0 to extend their win streak to four.

Northridge dropped each of its two games over the weekend, falling to 4-6-1 overall and 0-2 in Big West. The Anteaters, who were undefeated coming into the weekend, failed to win in their two conference opening games and fell to 8-1-2 overall and 0-1-1 in the conference.</p>\n<p>“I can’t think of a better way to finish the first week of conference,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We’ve been playing generally pretty well so far this season, but now it’s about getting results.

With just seconds left before overtime, a long ball aimed towards senior forward Reed McKenna took UCI junior goalkeeper Michael Breslin off his line to clear the ball under heavy pressure.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Gauchos, the clearance landed right at forward Nick DePuy’s feet. The sophomore was able to control the ball before taking a touch to his left and firing a deep strike into the top left corner of the net, earning his team a shocking victory.</p>\n<p>“As soon as I hit it, I knew it was going to be a goal,” DePuy said. “I saw the keeper off his line and decided to take a shot at it. It turned out to be a pretty good move.”</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Brandon Berke made five saves in the game, but none were more important than in the 69th minute when the Anteaters’ senior forward/midfielder Dennis Martinez found himself one-on-one with the freshman keeper. Berke smothered the chance, helping preserve the Gauchos’ second shutout of the season and bringing his record to 4-0 in starts this season.</p>\n<p>It was also the fourth game since Vom Steeg moved DePuy to starting forward, a move that seems to have paid off as UCSB has won every game since.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56498\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1610226506\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56457\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56498\" data-attachment-id=\"56498\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/msoccer_vsuci-20141004-dustinharris-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4.jpg?fit=3384%2C2226&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3384,2226\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412451066\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"255\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4.jpg?fit=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4.jpg?fit=888%2C584&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-56498\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4-1024x673.jpg?resize=888%2C584\" alt=\"UCSB freshmen forward Ludwig Ahl (left) has scored three goals this season, including two against Drake in the previous week.

DePuy was able to play a header back across goal towards junior defender/midfielder Duncan Backus who headed it in for his first goal of the season.</p>\n<p>The winner came in the 70th minute when freshman midfielder Axel Mendez found Murphy making a run down the left wing. Murphy sent a cross to the far-post to DePuy who was able to find good enough contact with the header to get it past the keeper and earn the Gauchos a 2-1 victory.</p>\n<p>“Anytime you can get a good result against a great team like Northridge, you’re happy,” Vom Steeg said. “It was a bit of a tale of two halves, but we’re improving on our game management skills and that allowed us to compete in the final 15 minutes of the game when they were trying to find a tying goal.”</p>\n<p>After notching two game-winning goals this past weekend, DePuy now leads his team with four goals on the season. Murphy, who won last week’s Big West Player of the Week award, now leads the Big West with five assists and shares team-high honors with DePuy for total points with nine.</p>\n<p>UCSB has now gone undefeated in its last twelve Big West regular season games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return to action against Cal State Fullerton on Thursday for their first road game in a month.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56457\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56457\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/","id":1551,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1550,1549,1548],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Conference With Homestand","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB men's soccer opens 2014 conference season tonight at Harder.

However, the Gauchos are offensively confident after coming off one of their strongest performances of the season, scoring four goals against Drake last Sunday.</p>\n<p>“Momentum is huge. Momentum is about feeling good about how your team is and how they’re playing,” Vom Steeg said. “You don’t want to go into these next two games without feeling really good about yourself because it’s conference; it’s a different game. Especially when you’re talking about Northridge or Irvine, it feels like NCAA playoff games.”</p>\n<p>The Matadors offense has been a one-man show thus far with senior Sagi Lev-Ari having scored a Big West-leading seven goals this season compared to two from the rest of his team. For the Gauchos, a balanced offensive attack has been a theme so far this season with their 13 total goals split between eight players. Sophomore Ismaila Jome continues to be a top offensive option as he works down the left side, while freshman forward Ludwig Ahl has emerged as a threat to opposing defenses with a team-high three goals.</p>\n<p>Last week’s Big West Player of the Week in sophomore midfielder Drew Murphy has also impressed as he continues to take on a bigger role for UCSB, accumulating a team-high three assists to go along with his two goals.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UC Irvine will bring to town a powerhouse of an offense that has seen an average of 2.33 goals per game. The Anteaters have been solid with their passing in the final third of the pitch, picking up 19 assists on their 21 total goals this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB has gone 0-3 against top 25 ranked teams this year, but the team has looked to take the positives away from those losses rather than dwell on them.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kick off Big West play against Northridge tonight at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium and return to action against Irvine on Saturday the same time</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 2, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56342\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/ucsb-opens-conference-with-homestand/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56342\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/ucsb-opens-conference-with-homestand/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/ucsb-opens-conference-with-homestand/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/ucsb-opens-conference-with-homestand/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/ucsb-opens-conference-with-homestand/","id":1552,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1551,1550,1549],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Capture Momentum With Pair of Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jomegonz.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jomegonz.jpg?resize=980%2C625&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes down Drake University and San Diego State to improve its record to 4-3-1.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its final two games before the beginning of Big West play, the UCSB men’s soccer team went undefeated this weekend with a 4-1 win over Drake University and a 1-0 victory over San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos improve to 4-3-1 on the season with their latest win over Drake on Sunday.

The freshman was able to keep the shot low as he placed it into the right side of the net, giving the Gauchos’ their fastest scored goal this season.</p>\n<p>“We talked about being dangerous, and I thought we were dangerous right from the get-go,” Vom Steeg said. “Our gameplan was to get on the board early and get good wide play from [Lopez] on the right and [sophomore midfielder Ismaila Jome] on the left. Sometimes you draw things up and it actually works and I tonight we got the ball in the right spots early and that first goal was really important.”</p>\n<p>UCSB kept the early pressure on and was able to capitalize off poor defending in the 21st minute. Left back Drew Murphy joined the attack before playing a 1-2 to Ahl and finding space at the edge of the box. The sophomore was then able to waltz through the defense against a weak challenge before scoring an easy tap-in goal past the keeper.</p>\n<p>“It’ll never happen again, it’s like they wanted everything but the ball,” Murphy joked. “It made me look good, a lot better than it was. I wouldn’t expect something like that again.”</p>\n<p>In the 28th minute, Murphy returned the favor, finding Ahl at the near post off a corner kick. Ahl finished it with a high, first-touch shot into the top left corner of the net, giving him a brace on the day.</p>\n<p>“[Ludwig] had the same look on Friday night and he put it over the bar, so I thought he took real good care of that thing to keep it down and tucked it in,” Vom Steeg said. “We got the ball in the right places, we put it in the right spot and I thought it was a great finish.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended up tacking on one more when in the 82nd minute, senior forward Reed McKenna got past his defender with a nice move on the right side of the box. He then set himself up for a shot on his favored left foot and fired it into the right corner of the net.</p>\n<p>What should have been a second straight shutout for UCSB and freshman goalkeeper Brandon Berke could not be preserved, however, as in the 85th minute, a Drake player earned a penalty after being knocked down in the box. Junior defender Alec Bartlett stepped up to put away his first goal of the season, placing his shot into the right side of the net while Berke dove the other way.</p>\n<p>In Friday’s game against San Diego State, the Gauchos shook up their lineup looking to bounce back from being shutout at home against No. 1 UCLA last week. Berke got the first start of his career at goalkeeper, filling in for injured sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely, and sophomore midfielder/defender Nick DePuy got the start at forward.</p>\n<p>The switch paid off, as DePuy got his team on the board in the 21st minute. A low-cross from Murphy took Aztec freshman goalkeeper Adam Allmaras off his line to slap the ball away, accidentally sending it right to DePuy, who easily put away his second goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Despite giving up three shots on goal and twelve in total, UCSB was able to earn its first shutout of the year behind Berke and his three saves. The Gauchos also had one of their most productive weekends offensively, getting off 33 shots through two games with 15 on frame.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to action this Thursday at 7:00 p.m. when it opens up its conference schedule against Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/","id":1548,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1547,1546,1545],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to End Preseason With Momentum","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.27.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-13.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.27.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-13.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB tries to rebound from loss to No. 1 UCLA with two home games this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off of a tough 1-0 loss to No. 1 UCLA last Saturday, the UCSB men’s soccer team is looking to get back on track with home games against San Diego State and Drake University this weekend.</p>\n<p>The loss to the Bruins dropped the Gauchos below .500 for the second time this season to a record of 2-3-1.

Despite the Aztecs’ hot start to the season, home-field advantage may prove to be an important factor as all five of their wins this year have come at home.</p>\n<p>“San Diego State is kind of a scrappy team. They won’t really make 10, 15 passes in a row,” sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely said. “I think they’re just going to try to sit behind the ball and capitalize on one of our mistakes, but that’s where we have to do better and keep it tight in the back.”</p>\n<p>San Diego’s offense is powered by forward David Olsen, who has scored a team-high five goals in seven starts. The 6’0” freshman is complemented on the attacking front by sophomore forward Forrayah Bass, who has accumulated three goals and four assists in only five starts this season.</p>\n<p>“[The Aztecs] have some good players up front that’ve been scoring a lot of goals,” Vom Steeg said. “I think it’s a dangerous attacking team, but they’ve also been giving up goals.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos did just hold the No. 1 team in the nation to a single goal last weekend, they have had some early season defensive struggles, most notably in giving up three goals to No. 22 Furman and four to No. 19 Stanford in previous weeks.</p>\n<p>“This is one of those games where I think it’s a good opportunity for us to take advantage of a defense that maybe isn’t as good as UCLA’s, but obviously we haven’t gotten a shutout this year,” Vom Steeg said. “We have a lot to do defensively to make sure that we start getting shutouts.”</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Drake will come to town looking to build on its recent 1-0 win over UMKC. The Bulldogs, who are currently averaging just over one goal per game as a team, have had their own share of defensive struggles this season, giving up 11 scores in just seven games.</p>\n<p>“The thing about Drake is that they’re a very disciplined team. They play basically a 4-5-1, they’re very organized,” Vom Steeg sad. “It’s a team that in the past we’ve struggled to find goals against, so hopefully we can find some goals on Friday night and have that lead into Sunday.”</p>\n<p>A point of emphasis for UCSB this weekend will be its offensive presence, especially after a solid defensive outing against UCLA was essentially wasted due to its inability to score a goal. So far, the team total of eight goals has been equally spread between eight different players.</p>\n<p>“Offensively, it’s not just scoring goals, we need to be more dangerous,” Vom Steeg said. “We need to be able to get more coming off the amount of times we’re on the ball.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos know they won’t necessarily be able to control how many goals they score or concede, what they must control is their mental game. Mental lapses on the defense have been costly at times this season, and the importance of every moment on the field will only grow when Big West play begins next week.</p>\n<p>“We have these little 10-minute lapses where we either lose focus or are under a bit of pressure, which is normal for soccer games. We just have to really stay focused for those 10 minutes,” McNeely said. “[The key] is just going to be staying focused for a full 90 minutes, improving on our defensive errors, and really staying focused in those ten-minute lapses.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against San Diego State is set for 7:00 p.m. this Friday, while the game against Drake is scheduled for 6:00 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of September 25, 2014th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Spearheading UCSB’s attack will be Jome, the player who currently leads the team with four total points (one goal, two assists). The young standout has lived up to early season expectations after being the only Gaucho named to the Big West Men’s Preseason All-Conference Team.</p>\n<p>While it hasn’t been a perfect start to the season for Santa Barbara, their only two losses did come against a pair of top 25 ranked teams in No. 19 Furman and No. 23 Stanford. With a relatively younger squad, the Gauchos are looking forward to what will be their biggest test before the beginning of conference play just two weeks from now.</p>\n<p>“We are a young team, and those were two hard tests which we obviously lost, but we’ve just grown as a team because of those tough losses,” Jome said. “The more games we get under our belt before conference the better. UCLA will be a big indicator of where we are right now, so we’re looking forward to that.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB is going to be able to come away with a favorable result this weekend, they will have to find a way to contain UCLA midfielder Leo Stolz. The senior leads his team with two goals and six shots on goal through six games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also be looking to keep possession numbers as even as possible, as the Bruins have shown that they are one of the best in the nation at holding the ball so far this season.</p>\n<p>“The key to the game is pressuring UCLA up the field and dispossessing them in their own half, and getting looks off that,” Jome said. “We need to be disciplined in our own half and not make mistakes like we did against Stanford and Furman which cost us cheap goals.”</p>\n<p>UCSB brings to the match a very balanced offensive attack which has seen a total of eight goals scored by eight different players through its first five games. </p>\n<p>After going winless in three straight games, the Gauchos pulled off a 4-1 win over Colgate last weekend, a match which saw midfielder Drew Murphy score his first goal of the season. The sophomore will be another important player to watch going against a stingy Bruin defense that has allowed an average of just .667 goals per game to opponents this season.</p>\n<p>“We knew we had to make a big statement against Colgate and we did that getting a 4-1 result. It just pushes our momentum forward going against UCLA,” Jome said. “I think we’ve made great strides to get where we need to be as far as just communicating on the field, knowing where we need to be, and being more disciplined as a team.”</p>\n<p>Defensive struggles have plagued UCSB early in the season, as it has allowed an average of two goals per game to opponents. However, the Gauchos are lucky to be facing a slumping Bruin offense which was just shutout in consecutive double-overtime home games last weekend.</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. this Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senior forward Reed McKenna looks primed to be an offensive leader this season already having tied his offensive production from last year with a goal and an assist in this year’s opener.</p>\n<p>Goals might be hard to come by for a relatively inexperienced squad, especially after the departure of the team’s top two goalscorers in Goffin Boyoko and Achille Campion. However, the 15-goal total that those departing players left behind might open the door for new players to showcase their talent.</p>\n<p>“We’re replacing [last year’s starters] with one of the best freshmen classes we’ve had in a long time,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The key is for us to incorporate our young players and have the starting sophomores step up and show their improvement. If we can get goals from new players, work on our defense and get on the same page, then by the end of the year we will be a very good team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will be playing at home during move-in weekend against San Diego State on Sept. 26 and Drake University on Sept. 28. The Gauchos’ quest for another Big West Conference title begins Oct. 2 at Harder Stadium against Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The early preseason exhibition gave the Gauchos their first look at a new lineup that has five new players in the starting lineup and at least nine overall.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for them to get off the mark in the new year as in the 12th minute sophomore midfielder Ismaila Jome pushed the ball up the middle before delivering a gorgeous through ball on the right side to McKenna. The senior’s initial one-time shot was saved by Westmont’s junior goalkeeper Josh Glover, but the rebound fell right back to McKenna who scored an easy goal after regaining his balance.</p>\n<p>UCSB proceeded to dominate possession for the rest of the first half with the Warriors continually attempting to catch the Gauchos on the break with unsuccessful long balls. Jome and McKenna were the best players on the field as they continued to put pressure on the Westmont back four, sending in dangerous crosses on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>After Jome won a corner in the 25th minute, McKenna put in a cross from the left corner flag that found a sky-high Murphy placing a header perfectly into the bottom right corner of the net. The goal gave UCSB a 2-0 lead that would remain intact until the final whistle, but the chances were not done.</p>\n<p>The second half told a different story from the Westmont perspective, as the Warriors tried to capitalize on several sloppy clearances and turnovers in play by UCSB defenders. However, sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely luckily didn’t need to record a single save on the night to preserve the shut out with Westmont attackers consistently missing the target on open looks.</p>\n<p>“I think [the second half] was good. The game opened up and we had a ton of opportunities,” McKenna said. “It could’ve turned into 3, 4, or 5 but you’re not always gonna score all your chances. I thought it was good that we were getting chances and it showed that we have a lot of firepower going forward.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos found themselves with more than one great chance to score, most notably on a breakaway in the 72nd minute when sophomore forward Armand Bagramyan had his one-on-one shot saved by the keeper. Bagramyan had a team-high five shots, as many as the entire Westmont team, as he led a bench mob that played for much of the second half.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re pretty far along,” McKenna said. “Obviously we have a group of 9 players coming in so it will take some time for them to get used to the college atmosphere and game but I think we’re ready to go down to South Carolina and perform well and win games.”</p>\n<p>Next weekend will see UCSB travel to South Carolina to play the College of Charleston at 4:30 p.m. on Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55979\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55979\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/","id":1173,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1172,1171,1170],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Season Against Westmont","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mens-Soccer-Vertical-Right-Facing-15.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mens-Soccer-Vertical-Right-Facing-15.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to start the year strong coming off a very successful 2013 campaign.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a year in which the UCSB men’s soccer team went undefeated in conference play, the Gauchos are set to kickoff the new season as they host Westmont in their annual exhibition game tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“The key for us is going to be the fact that we need to build on what we did last year with five seniors gone,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’ll be a bit of a slow process at the start and then hopefully we’ll get going.”</p>\n<p>With a 12-­6­-3 record last season and an impressive 7­-0­-3 mark in conference play, UCSB earned a No. 10 national seed in the NCAA Tournament.

Two of the more notable departures from the team, forwards Achille Campion and Goffin Boyoko, scored 15 out of the team’s 31 total goals on the year.</p>\n<p>“The key for us is our ability to get our players on the same page and of course we have to find goals from new players,” Vom Steeg said. “If we can get goals from new players, work on our defense, and get on the same page, then by the end of the year we will be a very good team.”</p>\n<p>Despite this loss in offensive production, a strong recruiting class has the team excited about its potential this year.</p>\n<p>“We’re replacing [last year’s starters] with one of the best freshmen classes we’ve had in a long time,” Vom Steeg said. “The key is for us to incorporate our young players and have the starting sophomores step up and show their improvement.”</p>\n<p>Out of the seven sophomores on the team, none perhaps will be more exciting to watch than Ismaila Jome.

Klinsmann made good decision after good decision as his team went on a historic run of 12 straight wins, the seventh-longest winning streak in the history of international soccer and the longest in the world at the time.  The streak included wins over No. 2 Germany, a near-perfect showing in the Gold Cup and a 2-0 comeback against Bosnia-Herzegovina on the road.</p>\n<p>The win-streak established Klinsmann as the right man to lead team USA into the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but his leadership was once against questioned when he cut Donovan from the World Cup roster.</p>\n<p>For thousands of fans, including myself, this move was difficult to understand and even harder to swallow. Not only does Donovan have the most goals and assists in the U.S. men’s national team’s history, but he was widely believed to still be the team’s best player at the age of 32. He won the Golden Ball in the Gold Cup, awarded to the tournament’s best player, and was valuable as an experienced leader having already played in three World Cups. This didn’t matter to Klinsmann, though, who claimed that the United States loves to reward its players for what they have done rather than rewarding them for how good they are now.</p>\n<p>Soon after, in what was apparently an attempt to motivate his team, Klinsmann claimed that there was not a “realistic chance” for Team USA to win the World Cup. The team had already been placed in this year’s “Group of Death,” put up against No. 2 Germany, No. 4 Portugal and its World Cup nemesis, Ghana.</p>\n<p>If these moves leading up to Brazil proved to be the wrong ones, Klinsmann would be the one to blame for a wasted World Cup.</p>\n<p>Now, with two games already having been played in Brazil, people all around the world are shocked once more by the brilliant decisions that Klinsmann has made.</p>\n<p>Forward Clint Dempsey got the United States off to an incredible start in its first match against Ghana by scoring a goal in the first minute of the game. Alejandro Bedoya performed well as he filled Donovan’s shoes on the right side.</p>\n<p>However, an injury to center back Matt Besler prompted Klinsmann to substitute young defender John Brooks in his place. As the second half began, I had one question going through my mind, the same question thatI’m sure thousands of other Americans had: “Who the hell is John Brooks?”</p>\n<p>In the 86th minute with the game tied at 1-1, the 21-year old German-American scored the game-winning goal off of a corner kick from teammate Graham Zusi. Now every fan who watched that game will remember the name John Brooks for the rest of their lives thanks to the decision by Klinsmann to put him on the pitch.</p>\n<p>More tough choices had to be made in the second group-stage match against Portugal with Altidore still out of the lineup and more injuries happening all over the place. Bedoya did not have the same performance he had in the team’s first match and was soon replaced by 20-year old DeAndre Yedlin.</p>\n<p>This was another questionable move that proved all of Klinsmann’s doubters wrong, as Yedlin came in with an immediate impact. In the 81st minute, he made a run to the end-line that led to Dempsey’s second goal against Portugal and a 2-1 lead for the US.</p>\n<p>A win or draw in its final group-stage match against Germany will have the USA through to the next round, but a loss by multiple goals could have them shockingly eliminated. Klinsmann, who obviously has a very intimate history with Germany, may have to pull another rabbit out of his hat to give team USA its most incredible World Cup group stage result ever.</p>\n<p>Can he do it again? Let’s hope so.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in June 24, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55854\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/klinsmann-just-what-team-usa-needs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55854\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/klinsmann-just-what-team-usa-needs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/klinsmann-just-what-team-usa-needs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/klinsmann-just-what-team-usa-needs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/klinsmann-just-what-team-usa-needs/","id":2028,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[2027,2026,2025],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Freshmen Ready to Build Upon UCSB’s Strong Finish to Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-02.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-02.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are set to bring in a much smaller recruiting class than they have in previous years, but  they hope that the incoming freshmen can make just as much an impact as they have in the past.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The season didn’t go quite as the No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team hoped it would as it missed out on the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished their season with a win in their last game over No. 18 UC Davis, earning them a fifth-place finish in the Big West Championships.

Everyone has been good teammates and it’s been a fun, competitive year, and we’ll look for that to continue next year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 15, 2014 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55317\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55317\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/freshmen-ready-to-build-upon-ucsbs-strong-finish-to-year/","id":5067,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5066,5065,5064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Add Six Freshmen to Roster","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensVolleyball4PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensVolleyball4PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=410%2C597&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has big shoes to fill with the departures of several key seniors.

After her senior season at St. Lucy’s Priory High School, Bast earned All-CIF honors and was named the San Gabriel Valley Tribune Player of the Year. With four league titles and two CIF Championships throughout high school, her history of winning is something that can surely help the Gauchos as they look to repeat as Big West champs.</p>\n<p>“Sydney is a really consistent player and we noticed that she has the skills as both a passer and a defender,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>Coming into the team at 5’8”, Kelly Bielaski is the tallest of the three new liberos. During her time at Dougherty Valley High School, Bielaski set the school records for career kills, digs and aces on her way to earning two Offensive Player of the Year awards and being named MVP after her senior year.</p>\n<p>“What really stood out from [Kelly] was her passing ability,” Lantagne Welch said. “She’s a really bright kid and I think that can translate well to the court.”</p>\n<p>The last of the three liberos is Jane Lamp from Thousand Oaks High School. At just 5’3”, Lamp helped lead her team to three consecutive undefeated seasons in league play and was named the team’s Best Defensive Player in her junior year. In each of her last two high school seasons, Lamp was named to the All-Marmonte League First Team as well as the All-Ventura County team.</p>\n<p>“Jane’s a go-getter. She’s not going to let her small stature get in her way,” Lantagne Welch said. “She’s a really energetic, fiery player and just brings a lot of energy to the court.”</p>\n<p>Adding offensive firepower will be outside hitter Chanel Hoffman. Hoffman finished her high school career with a Riverside County record of 1,338 kills and earned numerous postseason awards including Div. II Player of the Year and All-CIF Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Chanel is an all-around player and she’s going to have an opportunity to impact the game in both the front row and the back row,” Lantagne Welch said. “One of her strengths is her ability to do so many things well.”</p>\n<p>Joining UCSB’s good young group of middle blockers and outside hitters is 6’3” Megan Sullivan. After leading the way in her senior year with an impressive .353 hitting percentage, she was named to the Delta River All-League team and the Sacramento Bee All-Metro team.</p>\n<p>“Megan is a high-touching player,” Lantagne Welch said. “Just to get another good athlete in the program that’s playing a high level along the net is going to help our team tremendously.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the new recruits is setter/right-side hitter Noa Nightingale. A teammate of Sullivan’s in high school, Nightingale was listed in PrepVolleyball’s Players to Watch and Seniors Aces list as she went for 197 kills in her senior year without missing a start.</p>\n<p>“Noa gives us a lot of depth and flexibility,” Lantagne Welch said. “She’s really going to have some different looks depending on how everyone shapes out in the positions and whatnot. She’s a really hard worker and we’re excited about her versatility.”</p>\n<p>Last season, UCSB utilized numerous freshmen on its way to a Big West league title. These freshmen will have the same opportunity to make an immediate impact.</p>\n<p>“We’re not afraid to play freshmen,” Lantagne Welch said. “Our freshmen have been great in this program in the past so whoever earns it and can help us win the most is going to be out there on the floor.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 7th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55178\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55178\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-add-six-freshmen-to-roster/","id":5243,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5242,5241,5240],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":8,"highestPage":13,"route":"/authors/63"}},"__N_SSG":true}
