Ranked No. 22 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, Stojic and Dubavets participated in the NCAA tournament, becoming just the second Gaucho pair to play in the Round of 16.</p>\n<p>In addition to the milestones listed, the Gauchos also avenged last year’s Big West Conference final loss to CSU Long Beach by winning their first conference title in 20 years with a win over Hawaii to earn an NCAA Tournament bid.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara made the trip a tournament to remember as it knocked off the University of Kansas in the first round with a 4-3 victory and earned a chance to face No. 2 UC Berkeley in the second stage.</p>\n<p>Despite being swept in the second round by such a highly ranked team, UCSB’s efforts have earned it a current ranking of No. 56 in ITA standings, an encouraging sign of the team’s future upside.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Gauchos will have all 11 athletes eligible for return in the upcoming season. With no senior on the roster, all starters are expected to start and, with a heavy recruiting class, UCSB will be a team to look out for.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71560\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-31/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71560\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-31/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-31/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-31/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-31/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-tennis/","id":1109,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1108,1107,1106],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ No. 22 Duo Has Postseason Run Ended","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2193.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2193.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Helping extend the UCSB women's tennis team's season beyond its loss to Cal in the NCAA Tournament, the nation's No. 22 doubles pair in Stefani Stojic and Palina Dubavets were the Gauchos' last form o...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last Friday marked the end of the 2016 season for the UCSB women’s tennis team after the admirable effort of sophomore Palina Dubavets’ and junior Stefani Stojic’s participation in the NCAA Tournament’s doubles competition came to an end.</p>\n<p>Prior to being eliminated in the second round, the nation’s No. 22 ranked duo in Stojic and Dubavets defeated graduate student Rebeca Mitrea and junior Yuliya Shupenia of DePaul University.

Despite keeping the score close in a back and forth matchup, the Tar Heels evaded the Gauchos’ possible spoiler victory, winning the final set by a score of 10-7.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara exited the tournament sooner than it would have liked to, expectations for next season remains at an all-time high; especially when examining the fact that these two young tennis stars have only played one year together and have one more year ahead.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71559\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71559\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-28/gauchos-no-22-duo-has-postseason-run-ended/","id":1108,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1107,1106,1105],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Strong Pair Heads to Oklahoma for NCAA Tourney","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a successful regular season campaign, doubles pair junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets will look to dominate at the NCAA D1 Doubles Tournament beginning today.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1464150558792_2242\" class=\"yiv4529867077MsoNormal\"><span id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1464150558792_2241\">The UCSB women’s tennis team has concluded its season hitting all the major goals that Coach Simon Thibodeau had challenged its team to accomplish.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71388\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71388\" data-attachment-id=\"71388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-25/gauchos-strong-pair-head-to-oklahoma-for-ncaa-tourney/amanda-atanasson-returns-the-ball-to-the-opponent-jenny-luo-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-08-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Amanda Atanasson returns the ball to the opponent.

Eight times this season UCSB was forced to go to the seventh point and only twice has it come out on top.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB started strong as they sealed the doubles point after Kansas defaulted on court three.

Dubavets and Stojic also went undefeated during the Gauchos BWC title run just a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>The Jayhawks had a tough time during the Big 12 championships, defeating No. 40 Baylor 4-2 in the second round of the conference tournament. In the semifinals, however, Kansas was swept by eventual Big 12 champion No. 12 Oklahoma State. Despite falling short in the semis, Kansas still managed to clinch a No. 2 seed in this year’s NCAAs.</p>\n<p>Set for a fresh sleight after earning its first NCAA Tournament bid in 17 years and led by Head Coach Todd Chapman, who was recently named the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s (ITA) Central Region Coach of the Year on Tuesday, Kansas’ program is revitalized with youthful talent that could potentially achieve an opening round upset.</p>\n<p>Kansas’s standout freshman and the school’s first ever ITA Central Region Freshman of the Year is Anastasiya Rychagova. The young Russian from Moscow is currently ranked 77th in the ITA singles rankings after ending the season with a 15-5 singles and 28-6 doubles record.</p>\n<p>Rychagova has yet to play against other nationally ranked opposition, but that does not mean she has played easy competition. The true freshman has gone to the third set on seven different occasions this season and has gone 3-4 when forced to play three. Rychagova has come into the program without losing a step under Chapman in his third year at the helm.</p>\n<p>Chapman has elevated the program back to the success it has seen in years past, earning an NCAA berth for the first time since 1999, and it was the first time since 2002 that the Jayhawks moved on to the Big 12 semifinals.</p>\n<p>Both teams have the element of a good coach in common with each other. With Head Coach Simon Thibodeau at the forefront of the Santa Barbara program, the Gauchos have not only earned a spot at the NCAAs, but have also claimed a Big West Conference title along the way.</p>\n<p>The Jayhawks and the Gauchos will play this Friday, May 13 at Cal’s Hellman Tennis Complex at 10 a.m. The winner will advance to the next round and face the winner of No. 1 Cal versus the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

During that time the Gauchos were riding the momentum of a five year championship dynasty spearheaded by coach Chris Russell from 1991-1995.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This past weekend however, Santa Barbara took the first step needed to have another string of championships that this program has not had since the nineties.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Winning the first title in 20 for UCSB feels amazing, especially coming here and doing it from the first year, it is a wonderful feeling to be in the program,” Dubavets, the first year gaucho, said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB earned its seventh Big West title in school history after defeating the Aggies of UC Davis, CSU Northridge, and Hawaii.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The championship run began with a quick sweep of the seventh seeded UC Davis on Friday morning.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No.21 sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic made easy work of senior Tiffany Pham and junior Alex Huie by beating them 6-1 on court one.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomores Lou Adler and fellow gaucho Amanda Atanasson swept their opponents 6-0 and clinched the doubles point for UCSB.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After establishing a one point lead the Gauchos went on to win the next three singles matches to close out the contest.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Palina Dubavets beat sophomore Kristy Jorgensen in two sets 6-0 &amp; 6-1. Junior Jaimee Gilbertson and sophomore Natalie Da Silveira won their matches in consecutive sets as well.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The following day Santa Barbara faced off against CSUN and extended its win streak to seven by defeating the Matadors 4-1.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While the Gauchos continued breezed through the first two rounds, Hawaii was upsetting last years’ Big West champion LBSU in a close 4-3 win.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Long Beach was heavily favored and expected to meet UCSB at the finals for a rematch of the last years conference finals matchup.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We expected to play with Long Beach in the final, but we did not forget that Hawaii brought us a lot of problems a few months ago when we played against them, so it was also expectable.” Dubavets explained.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, thanks to freshman Marina Hruba and junior Cindy Nguyen on courts one and two, and the rest of the Rainbow Wahine they managed to earn themselves a ticket to the finals.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Saturday morning at the Indian Well Tennis Garden, Santa Barbara swept Hawaii 4-0 in a closely contested match, despite what the score may have indicated. Yet the Gauchos would not be denied a title after a long season of narrow defeats.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Palina Dubavets and Stefani Stojic wrapped up their undefeated weekend by putting six past senior Paulina Petriskova and sophomore Klara Pribylova.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On court two Hawaii won a set of its own 6-3 by beating junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All eyes were on court three as Atanasson and Adler engaged in a back and forth contest against senior Sarah Gealer and freshman Marina Hruba in order to clinch the doubles point and establish a crucial lead.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Earlier in the season during their first encounter, Adler and Atanasson fell to a different combination of Rainbow Warriors but after a series of close exchanges the young gauchos found redemption by winning the set 6-4, and the opening point.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB continued the onslaught and went on to win the next three singles matches. Excluding Da Silveira’s dominant singles performance against Petriskova all the matches were decided by two points.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The UCSB women’s tennis team has earned a bid to the NCAA championships following their conference victory and its first round opponent will be revealed Tuesday, May 3rd which will be streamed at <em>NCAA.com</em>. Its first round match-up will take place on May 13.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Able to retain his current total of four Middleweight titles with his weekend victory, the question of who can stop Triple G’s reign remains.</p>\n<p>Fighting in front of a crowd of 16,353 roaring fans at the sold-out Forum in Inglewood, Calif. in addition to the thousands of fans tuning in by purchase of Pay-Per-View, this past weekend was a clear reminder that boxing is still king in the fighting industry.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming into the fight, Golovkin was the clear favorite with the odds in his favor. Wade was a +1600 underdog. Meaning, had Wade won and someone placed a hundred dollar bet on him, those that gambled on the 26 year old would have received a $1600 payout according to <em>ESPN.com</em>.</p>\n<p>However, the game of odds did not hold much significance in Saturday’s bout once the bell rung and the referee gave the signal for the clash to begin as Golovkin established his lopsided dominance from its very beginning.</p>\n<p>Wade, in his neon green Everlast gloves, attempted to establish the jab early against a fairly static Golovkin. In typical Triple G fashion, Gennady walked down his opponent and did not show much head movement in the early parts of the round, but Wade was unable to capitalize on Golovkin’s lax defense.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the round, Golovkin, a Kazakhstan native, landed a solid overhand right and dropped Wade for the first time with only ten seconds remaining in the opening round, marking the beginning of the end for the young American middleweight.</p>\n<p>Despite getting knocked down in the first, Wade seemed to have gotten himself back together as he entered the second round connecting with a flurry of punches, but Golovkin regained his composure showing some solid defense and continued to seek his opponent.</p>\n<p>Triple G took the punishment but seemed unmoved and responded a few moments later with a three punch combination that would drop Wade for a second time. The jab, uppercut and cross all landed with fervor and it might have been the end right there, but Dominic showed the heart of a champion by getting up and began exchanging once again. Regardless of the heart Dominic displayed, Gennady Golovkin wrapped up the night by delivering an unforgiving right hand on the button. With all that it was over.</p>\n<p>As Triple G added another consecutive knockout as well as another successful title defense to his already impressive resume, there was a question looming over everyone’s head: Will Saul “Canelo” Alvarez be the next opponent?</p>\n<p>For the sake of boxing, we hope so.</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned in my colleague Sean White’s “Rebirth of The Ringside, Thurman Vs. Porter,” the sport of boxing is due for a major facelift. As the career of Manny Pacquiao nears its ending following the retirement of Floyd Mayweather Jr., the boxing industry is in need of a new ‘poster boy.’</p>\n<p>However, what my fellow counterpart has failed to mention is that the sport of boxing does not need to be revived; it has and always will continue to thrive. Perhaps to the casual boxing fan there are not enough stars in the sport to attract them to drop hard-earned cash to watch a hard-fought fight.</p>\n<p>Certainly, UFC and MMA has been a hot commodity over the past years, garnering the attention of many. But the truth of the matter is that both fighting organizations still have a long way to go. With regard to the vulnerability of all fighters in both MMA and boxing, it’s difficult to surpass the reality that the elite fighters of the UFC and MMA still make just a fraction of the pay day’s top prize fighters in boxing currently make.</p>\n<p>A fair question would be, why is it that there is such a disparity between combat athletes? I would propose to take a look at the popularity of the sports as a primary indicator as to how much each sport can afford to pay its athletes.</p>\n<p>The more paying viewers open to patronize the sport, the more the promotion has in profit, which in turn can find its way to compensate the fighters.</p>\n<p>According to a survey conducted on the discrepancy between the two combat sports posted on <em>sherdog.com</em>, the global authority on mixed martial arts, MMA has less avid fans than boxing.</p>\n<p>The amount of boxing fans weigh in at totals of 12,698,000, while the MMA fan base is at 12,219,000. Aside from the sheer numbers, it is when the demographics get broken down that there is a clearer understanding as to why one sport makes more money than the other.</p>\n<p>MMA has more viewers in the 18-29 age group than boxing. A total of 1,133,000 in that demographic have reported that they would prefer to watch Mixed Martial Arts. According to the same study on the other hand, the older age groups consisting of 30-44 and 45-64 would rather watch boxing. That is 853,000 more people with more money to spend.</p>\n<p>Even though the future is looking good for MMA, currently the demographic with the most disposable income would prefer to spend their cash on good ol’ fashion pugilism.</p>\n<p>Despite all the numbers, statistics, PPV buys and more, most people get stuck in a mindset of the polarity. For most people it is either or, but one thing is for sure. There is definitely enough room for the both of them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/","id":3300,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[3299,3298,3297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Greatness Comes in Pairs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2193.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2193.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Looking to take each of their playing careers to a higher level, the UCSB women's tennis team's transfer athletes in Palina Dubavets and Stefani Stojic have brought a refreshing element to the Gauchos...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time and time again we are told that hard work pays off, to keep our nose on the grindstone and to continue to move forward.

In singles, she recorded a 17-10 overall record along with recording a 19-14 doubles record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After just one year at TCU, Palina decided it would be in her best interest to look for a fresh start out West. Her search for a new place to call home came to a close once she became acquainted with UCSB’s elite coaching staff, stellar academics and sunny California weather.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Two main reasons to come here: the coaches and academics. I had to be really sure that the coaches were really good because they take a lot of time from your life, so I had to make sure there was a good chemistry,”Dubavets said. “Academics are definitely a lot better here at UCSB than TCU, and the location and climate is really good for tennis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Able to complete the transfer process and be welcomed to the UCSB women’s tennis program with open arms, Dubavets became another international asset to Santa Barbara’s program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entering UCSB with similar intentions of a fresh start, Australia native Stojic was determined to contribute to the Gauchos’ recruiting progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stojic picked up the tennis racket at an early age and has yet to put it down. Since then, she has made quite an impact in the tennis community by creating an extensive resume of her own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I started when I was seven. It got pretty serious, and then from there it was just playing under Australia and representing Australia through all those International Tennis Federation and junior tournaments,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After years of training, her junior career culminated during the 2011 Australian Open whenStojic faced some of today’s tennis stars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the main draw of the girl singles competition, she was pitted against Klara Fabikova from the Czech Republic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Fabikova plays for the Golden Bears of Cal and is ranked No. 12 in the nation according to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. Stefani managed to demonstrate what she is capable of by defeating a young Fabikova 6-3 in two consecutive sets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following round, Stojic competed against Monica Puig who is currently ranked top 40 in the world in the pro circuit, and the experience that Stefani had with her is something she has yet to forget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After participating in junior competitions, Stojic, like her fellow Gaucho transfer teammate Dubavets, made a decision to go to college because of the financial hardships that come with participating in tournaments at an elite level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So instead of going pro right after high school, she decided to pursue tennis at one of the best tennis programs in the country, the University of Florida, is currently ranked third in the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I didn’t know I was going to go to college,” Stojic said. “I thought I was going to jump into professional tennis, but financially it was too hard to travel. So, I came to college looking to get better and get a degree.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like most professional athletes can attest to, the journey is not a simple one, it is a process of stumbling and overcoming any obstacles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two years of being underutilized at the University of Florida, Stojic decided to take her talents to Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t get to play much, and we had a really strong team at the University of Florida,” Stojic explained. “We had eight players and it was always hard to get into the lineup. I personally want to go pro after college, so for me, it was important to get a load of matches and playing so I can go pro. So I was trying to find a school that I knew I would be playing top in line and get good quality matches every week consistently.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing time and opportunity have definitely been afforded to both Stojic and Dubavets here at UCSB. Regardless of all the chances that might be offered, it is up to the athlete to ensure that their production equals or even surpasses expectation in order to ensure a spot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two definitely have not disappointed as they have helped the Gauchos amass their season-high national ranking of No. 65 earlier in the season. They have been an important staple for UCSB’s young roster as the two are currently the team’s leaders in wins in singles and doubles at the one slot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to doubles action,Stojic and Dubavets have been a force to be reckoned with, losing only twice this season. They also have had an undefeated record against other top ranked doubles duos, having defeated No. 7 Gabby Smith and Giuliana Olmos of USC earlier in the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus far, Stojic and Dubavets have thrived at the collegiate level, reaching a high doubles ranking albeit playing together for just one year. Competing together has come naturally as the two have meshed quite well with an impeccable chemistry on and off the courts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are both aggressive players with a good serve, and it’s just a really good mix, so it’s all been pretty easy,” Dubavets said. “There is a lot of chemistry and confidence between us”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been pretty easy, because our game styles are pretty similar and our personalities as well. It’s been chill, all very chill when we play together,” Stojic agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These two, along with the rest of the currently No. 74 ranked UCSB women’s tennis team, are players to keep an eye on as they prepare for the Big West Championships beginning this Thursday, April 28th, with hopes of making it to the NCAA Tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from excelling at the collegiate level, Stojic and Dubavets are aiming to do what their competitors have already done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I still definitely want to turn pro afterwards, give it a good two years and hopefully get a sponsor that can help me work and travel and make it on the pro side” Stojic said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outlook for both players is tremendous as they have another year to work together. As long as they maintain the faith in the process, they will only continue to grow as athletes in the sport of tennis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not every year that two talented individual players with similar backgrounds and expectations of the sport can come together and play with something to prove. But sometimes, just sometimes, greatness comes in pairs.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/","id":83,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[82,81,80],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos End Season on High Note, Clinch No. 2 Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WomensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WomensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's tennis team concluded the 2015-16 regular season with two wins this weekend, entering the Big West Championships with a five-match win streak.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 75 UCSB women’s tennis team closed out the weekend and the regular season on a high note extending its win streak to five matches, defeating Big West Conference rival Cal Poly and Santa Clara University.

We are a dangerous team,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “We are a sleeping team that is not ranked as high, but we are right there and we are playing better. We are ready to roll in the Big West, we can beat everyone in the conference.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Santa Barbara continued its efficient play against the Mustangs. Sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson earned victories as they made quick work of senior Bryn Bacharach and freshman Celine Gruaz on court three.</p>\n<p>Freshman Stephanie Yamada and junior Melissa Baker almost earned a shutout of their own beating sophomores Abigail Bacharach and Molly Reed 6-1.</p>\n<p>No. 21 ranked doubles duo junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets were ahead 5-0 before the match went on unfinished as Yamada and Baker were able to clinch the doubles point beforehand.</p>\n<p>With the score at 1-0, the Gauchos continued to outperform the Mustangs winning the next five points in singles never trailing at any point during the match.</p>\n<p>Adler, Dubavets, Stojic, junior Jamiee Gilbertson, and Atanassan all won their singles matches in convincing fashion extending the lead and ensuring the win against Cal Poly. With the score at 6-0, all eyes were on court six as sophomores Molly Reed and Natalie Da Silveira were in their third set.</p>\n<p>The first went in Da Silveira’s favor as she edged out Reed 6-4.

Reed extended her singles win streak to three straight and ended her season going 6-4 in singles.</p>\n<p>With their momentous win to close out the Big West, the Gauchos turned around to wrap up their regular season against a tough Santa Clara team.</p>\n<p>Originally scheduled for a meeting in March, the match had to be postponed because of rain.With no rain clouds in sight, Santa Barbara and Santa Clara entered into a tough contest between two talented teams.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to ensure a one point lead after winning the Doubles Point. Both pairs consisting of Dubavets &amp; Stojic as well as Yamada &amp; Baker won their respective sets 6-4 to start the match strong for UCSB.</p>\n<p>During the singles matches, the Broncos won two of the following five matches to get on the scoreboard. However, with strong play from Lou Adler, Stefani Stojic, and Natalie Da Silveira Santa Barbara won the match 4-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s two wins to conclude the season helped it to wrap up its campaign with a 15-7 overall and 7-1 Big West record. UCSB look to enter the big west tournament and dominate and avenge its only conference loss, 4-3, to Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“We can dominate at each position.

However, against nationally ranked doubles competition Santa Clara is 0-2.</p>\n<p>In singles, leading the team is junior Daniella Silva. She is 12-6 overall and presents a versatile skillset that has served as beneficial for the rest of the team as she has found success in matching up with the competition on the one, two, three and four courts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ match at Santa Clara will be their last of the regular season.

Although rain caused a series of delays throughout the match, Santa Barbara seemed unmoved even when they lost the opening doubles point for the third time this month despite having a top 20 doubles pair in the country.</p>\n<p>Junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets are the fifteenth best duo according to the ITA rankings, together they have a 20-4 overall record and their dual record is at 10-2 all of which are at the one slot. However, they have hit a bit of rough patch as of late as they lost both times this weekend and are 2-3 against inner conference opponents.</p>\n<p>Against the anteaters Stojic and Dubavets lost to junior Mazy Watrous and senior Sarah Gong 6-3 giving the second set in doubles to the Anteaters after gauchos sophomore Natalie Da SIlveira and junior Jamiee GIlbertson beat senior Andrea Duva and sophomore  Ashlynn Hall 6-2 to kickoff the match.</p>\n<p>All eyes were on court two as junior gaucho Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada played against sophomore Vivien Dvali and junior Taylor Lefridge for a potentially crucial match point. Lefridge and Dvali proved too much for the Gauchos as they clinched the doubles point giving Irvin its first point.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to rally behind sophomore Amanda Atanassans’ quick win over senior Andrea Duva winning both sets convincingly 6-2 and 6-0. It then went on to win the next five matches in a similar manner with the exception of the fifth match that went to three sets. Vivien Dvali beat UCSB’s Dubavets to take its second point. The match ended 5-2.</p>\n<p>The following day Santa Barbara Traveled down to Fullerton to face the Titans in a match to determine the second place spot on the Big West standings. The day started with another Dubavets and Stojic loss, losing 6-1 to juniors Camille De Leon and Alexis Valenzuela.</p>\n<p>The subsequent match was decided by two points. Sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson defeated Sarah Nuno and Danielle Pham 7-5. Junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada beat freshmen Masako Makiba and Karla Portalatin in another evenly contested matchup 7-6 (2) in order to seal the doubles point in favor of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB extended the lead to 2-0 after an impressive Stojic win over Karla Portalatin winning both sets 6-1. Santa Barbara never lost the lead and  on to went win 5-2.</p>\n<p>Despite dropping from national rankings, Santa Barbara is gathering a full head of steam heading into the post-season with minimal losses and maximum momentum.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will close out Big West Conference play this Saturday against Cal Poly at Mustang Tennis Complex at 10 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gauchos-move-up-in-big-west-standings-after-solid-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gauchos-move-up-in-big-west-standings-after-solid-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gauchos-move-up-in-big-west-standings-after-solid-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gauchos-move-up-in-big-west-standings-after-solid-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gauchos-move-up-in-big-west-standings-after-solid-weekend/","id":1085,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1084,1083,1082],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Serve Seventh Place Irvine, First Place Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to improve upon their solid 4-1 Big West record and third place conference standing when it takes on seventh place UCI and first place CSU Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team will be hitting the road this week to face two Big West foes, UC Irvine and CSU Fullerton, as it looks to continue its dominant start to conference play.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69452\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"921958633\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69540\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69452\" data-attachment-id=\"69452\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/amanda-atanasson-returns-the-ball-to-the-opponent-jenny-luo-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Amanda Atanasson returns the ball to the opponent.

Participating in UCSB’s lone game victory was sophomore Natalia Da Silveira. Da Silveira was one half of a doubles team that won although Santa Barbara lost the opening doubles point.</p>\n<p>While Irvine managed to defeat UCSB in last year’s matchup, the Anteaters possess a youthful roster in which a majority of their players are underclassmen. As a result of this youth, UCI has struggled with establishing consistency on the court.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters have used 18 different duos in doubles play. Nonetheless, in singles play, aside from senior Sarah Gong, every player on UCI’s team has been used in different positions from the two spot to the six.</p>\n<p>The inconsistency may be a contributing factor to such a disappointing season, as thus far the Anteaters sit within the bottom of the pack in the conference standings with their three victories coming against UC Davis, Middle Tennessee and Grand Canyon University.</p>\n<p>Contrary to UCI’s consistency woes, CSUF has been one of the conference’s most improved teams. After a seventh place Big West finish last season, 10-12 overall and 2-6 conference record, the Titans are currently on a three-match winning streak with just three matches remaining.</p>\n<p>However, although the Titans have an impressive record, they have played virtually no ranked opposition unlike the other top three teams in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the last time these two teams played, it did not end well for the Titans. UCSB swept Fullerton 7-0 and could possibly upset the Titans as it is off to an encouraging start.</p>\n<p>“We would hope so [[We would hope [to beat the Titans]]], we have a shot in every position and they have improved a lot and we have as well,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “They are tough. We have to take them very seriously.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton standout junior Alexis Valenzuela is definitely a player to watch out for on the Titans’ side of the court. In singles, she leads the team with a 14-3 dual record and all of those are at the one spot. She is also one half of a fairly tough doubles team alongside junior Camille De Leon, as they both have stringed together a nearly flawless doubles record.</p>\n<p>The pair of juniors have a 12-1 dual record in doubles all at the one slot as well. Valenzuela and De Leon will more than likely need to face off against UCSB’s power duo of junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets, who are currently ranked at the No. 15 spot in the ITA rankings.</p>\n<p>UCSB, with only four matches remaining in the regular season, is currently standing at third in the Big West conference after recently enduring its only conference loss against defending Big West Conference champions Long Beach State last Saturday.</p>\n<p>This Saturday, April 9 the Gauchos will play at UC Irvine at 12 p.m. On Sunday, April 10 UCSB will face off against CSU Fullerton at 11 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/","id":1074,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1073,1072,1071],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 65 Gauchos Defeat CSUN and UCR, Lose 4-3 to No. 67 LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-11-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its last home matches of the season, the No. 65 UCSB women's tennis team managed to improve to 4-1 in Big West play with victories over CSUN and UCR despite being edged by No. 67 Long Beach State.

The matadors were 2-2 in the Big West prior to Friday’s match. UCSB did not have an easy time against CSUN but still managed to win 4-3.</p>\n<p>“Northridge is a tricky team to play,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “(CSUN) came in playing pretty well and we started slow but we were able to win the match.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara started the month losing the opening doubles point for the first time since dropping to Oregon in Hawaii. No. 16 in doubles Sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic lost to juniors Mickey Hsu and Kristen Poei 6-4.</p>\n<p>Sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson managed to give the Gauchos a fighting chance by beating sophomore Kiryang Kim and junior Mari Taslagyan 6-2.</p>\n<p>With the doubles point up for grabs, it was between junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada on one side of the net against the Matadors’ junior Vivian Lin and freshman Skyla Alcon.</p>\n<p>In true Big West fashion, the drama did not end there, but rather continued in a back and forth contest. The doubles match gave a glimpse of how the contest would conclude with a narrow ending.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the game ended in favor for Northridge as it squeaked by with the win to grant CSUN its first point of the day, winning by a score of 7-6.</p>\n<p>However, the remaining games went back and forth similar to the last doubles set. The first singles match between Stefani Stojic and Kirsten Poei on court three went fairly quickly as Stojic only conceded one point in two sets, winning 6-1, 6-0.</p>\n<p>The next singles match also went in favor of the Gauchos as Dubavets defeated Vivian Lin on court two by scores of 6-2 and 6-1 to hand the Gauchos a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>In response, Northridge’s Alcon managed to tie the match by overcoming UCSB’s Atanasson 6-4 in the first set and 6-2 in the second. With the score knotted at 2-2, the next two events went resulted in a point for each team, leaving the match to be decided by the two players on court six.</p>\n<p>Juniors Jaimee Gilbertson and Mari Taslagyan went all three sets in an intense contest between the then top three teams in the conference.</p>\n<p>Taslagyan won the first set 7-5 but dropped the next two sets. The second finished 7-6(5) and the third 6-4 all in favor of Gilbertson who extended her single’s dual record to 7-6. The match ended with a 4-3 win for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Saturday morning’s match between reigning Big West Conference champion, No. 67 Long Beach State, and runner up UCSB was a lot closer than any of last year’s encounters were.</p>\n<p>Last season when the two teams met, the 49ers won 6-1 and beat the Gauchos in the conference final 4-1. This time around, the 49ers managed to edge UCSB for a 4-3 victory.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to win, even though we lost, we feel pretty good on our chances against Long Beach,” Thibodeau said. “We didn’t play well in doubles, lost at five and six. [But], we can surely win next time if we play better at doubles and better at the five and six we can do pretty well. It was still positive to see we lost 4-3. We still have lots of room to improve and this is the closest we have been to beating them”.</p>\n<p>UCSB started slow once again, losing the doubles point quickly having two of the three matches end with a score of 6-2 while the match in which Dubavets and Stojic participated in went unfinished.</p>\n<p>However, as soon as the singles portion of the match commenced, Santa Barbara demonstrated its capability to compete against the 49ers as the Gauchos won three straight to go up 3-1 against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>But, the 49ers proved why they were the defending champs as they went on to win three straight in singles to clinch a 4-3 win.</p>\n<p>After another narrow defeat, the Gauchos had one day to turnaround and face one of the weaker Big West Conference opponents in UC Riverside. Head coach Simon Thibodeau managed to rest a few of his starters as the Gauchos were still able to defeat the Highlanders 7-0.</p>\n<p>This weekend helped to foreshadow the competitive race set to take place in the Big West standings as Long Beach State remain atop of the conference with its 6-0 standing and UCSB is at third with its 4-1 record behind another conference undefeated in CSU Fullerton. Fullerton has yet to face Long Beach or Santa Barbara this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/","id":102,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[101,100,99],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 65 Gauchos With Trio of Conference Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering conference play with a three-match winning streak, the UCSB women's tennis team will attempt to extend its latest winning stretch in its set of conference opening matches at home versus CSUN,...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past week has been an eventful one for the No. 65 UCSB women’s tennis team as it returned to the national rankings after beating tough teams during the Spring Break, including No. 39 Fresno State.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 9-6 overall after winning their last three games with one of those wins coming against the Bulldogs.

CSUN is currently 2-2 and is fourth in the conference standings after defeating UC Riverside and Cal Poly, but losing to Long Beach State 6-1 and CSU Fullerton 5-2.</p>\n<p>Matador standout junior Mickey Hsu is leading the team in wins at 8-7 overall in singles play with all but one of those matches at the first slot. Hsu also is part of CSUN’s best doubles pair along with junior Kristen Poei. Together, they have a 6-8 record in doubles with all the matches played at the one.</p>\n<p>Following the Northridge matchup, the Gauchos will play on Saturday against defending Big West champs Long Beach State. The 49ers are currently tied for first with Cal State Fullerton in the Big West, but have played two more games than UCSB so far.</p>\n<p>The Niners are 4-0 in conference and have been playing well all year long, as evident with their 11-4 overall record. Long Beach has won eight of its last 10, losing only to No. 3 North Carolina State and No. 9 Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, this matchup will be a tough contest for both sides, as both teams are only separated by two spots in the national rankings. Even though LBSU boasts a 10-2 record at home, the 49ers are 1-2 away from Long Beach.</p>\n<p>Junior Maeva Razakasoa has reached the no. 60 slot on the national rankings for singles, moving up six places from a week ago. The French native has accumulated an 11-3 dual record all at the one, and has won nine of her last 10 played.</p>\n<p>She is 2-2 against nationally ranked singles players. Razakasoa also is part of a tough doubles team alongside junior Julie Gerrard; together they both are 9-2, winning four straight in doubles, but have not beaten any nationally ranked doubles pair.</p>\n<p>Long Beach also has a nationally ranked doubles duo at the no. 36 spot consisting of juniors Laura Eales and Hayley Thompson. Together, they are 8-2 in duals as a pair with a record of 2-1 against other ranked opposition.</p>\n<p>It will undoubtedly be an interesting matchup between No. 36 and No. 11 in doubles, Gauchos junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will wrap up the weekend against UC Riverside. The Highlanders have struggled this season to find a consistent winning formula as they currently are riding a five-game losing streak with a 3-10 overall record and 0-4 start in conference play.</p>\n<p>Last time these two teams played against each other was last year, and it did not go well for UCR as it was swept by UCSB 7-0. Sophomores Lou Adler and Natalie Da Silveira will hope to continue last year’s newfound success. Adler and Da Silveira managed a doubles win, and the young Brazilian earned a singles victory at the one slot last time they played.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be busy for UCSB as it will play against Big West Conference rivals Friday against Northridge at 2:30 p.m., Saturday against Long Beach State 11 a.m. and Sunday versus UC Riverside at 10 a.m., with all games at the Rec Cen Courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 1, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-65-gauchos-winning-streak-at-stake-in-big-west-opening-weekend/","id":104,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[103,102,101],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Suffers Second Home Loss of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos have lost yet another close match this season after Harvard defeated them 4-3, dropping UCSB to 6-6 overall.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p class=\"p1\">The UCSB women’s tennis team went head to head against the Harvard Crimson on Saturday and suffered its second home loss since February’s matchup against Washington State leaving them with a record of 6-6.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68678\" style=\"width: 145px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68678\" data-attachment-id=\"68678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68691/lou-adler-hitts-a-backhand-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lou Adler hitts a backhand.

But no excuse.

The first to finish was the Gaucho duo consisting of sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson as they defeated senior Amy He and sophomore Nikki Kallenberg 6-3.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Adler and Atanasson are 10-6 overall, 6-3 in dual matches, and proving to be an efficient pair but have played mostly at the three spot winning all six matches while losing three times at the two spot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The next match ended in the same score as the first as junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada beat freshman Erica Oosterhout and junior June Lee who are 4-8 as a pair. Baker and Yamada on the other hand are 3-2 winning two straight and demonstrating consistency at the second slot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The last doubles match to finish was between the 18th best pair in the country against sophomore Annika RIngblom and freshman Sabrina Xiong that were 5-1 together prior to the start of the matchup.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic handed them their second dual loss of the season by beating the Crimson pair 6-4. Stojic and Dubavets are 17-3 overall and 7-1 in dual play, all at the the one for UCSB.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After securing the first point, Santa Barbara managed to increase its lead by two when sophomore Dubavets beat sophomore Kallenberg in the singles portion of the contest in two sets winning both 6-2. However, UCSB would go on to lose the next four in singles to lose the match.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other half of the powerful Gaucho duo faced off against the sophomore she had just gotten off the court against in doubles. Ringblom and Stojic went all three sets. The first set finished in favor for SB finishing 4-6.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, after winning the first Stojic lost the next two by the scores of 6-4 and 6-3 in a close contest. This match was Stojic’s first coming off an injury where she took three weeks off.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It bugs her a little bit more during practice, but she (Stojic) was up 6-4 and it might have been rust seeing as she hasn’t played in three weeks.” Said Coach Thibodeau. “This is not just on stefani but all the matches that could have gone the other way. I believe she will step it up in the future and she is motivated to do so, and I look forward to seeing her do it”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another key matchup was between a highly anticipated encounter between senior Amy He and sophomore Natalie Da Silveira. Both came in with positive singles records and multiple consecutive wins. He and Da Silveira have played consistently at the six and that is where they met on Saturday.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After a tough and back and forth game He was able to steal the first set winning 7-6. The second set on the other hand, it seems as if He was able to figure out the young Brazilian and continued to get the ball past her six more times as she won 6-1 to give the Crimson its first point of the dual.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After which Harvard went on to carry the momentum from that big win to win the next three as the tide began to turn against the Gauchos after these crucial points went the other way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We are usually strong at the bottom positions. The second set with Natalie i thought she would come back but then was down 4-0.” Said the Santa Barbara Head Coach. “But we have to move forward we have to finish our matches.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomore Lou Adler defeated junior June Lee in three sets, 6-7,6-3, and 6-1 to grant UCSB its third and final dual point. The match finished 4-3 in favor for the Crimson.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB will have to shake off another close loss and prepare for a quick turnaround as it takes on No. 24 Fresno State on Monday, March 21 at 11 a.m at the Rec Center Courts.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69067\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69067\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/","id":99,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[98,97,96],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/285"}},"__N_SSG":true}
