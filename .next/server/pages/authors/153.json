Dela Cruz, a fourth-year history of public policy major, was also reelected to the board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD board votes on these two positions annually. Each board member was also reelected to their respective standing committees, which include the Personnel, Finance and Policy &amp; Ordinance committees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board encourages members from the community to participate in the committees. According to the meeting minutes, a request for “letters of interest” from community members who wish to join the committees will be published next week, and submissions will be considered at the board meeting planned for Feb. 6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD board also discussed their application for grants from the Coastal Grant Fund. The fund is comprised of Associated Students (A.S.) student fees and is available for all coastal improvements in the Isla Vista and Goleta area, particularly in communities with low accessibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two grant amounts: “major” grants for projects estimated to cost more than $1,000 and “minor” grants for projects costing less. The board is primarily focused on applying for the major grants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Daniel Torres, who was elected to the board in November, the IVRPD board would use the grant money for one of several community projects. The board discussed the possibility of installing more community gardens at Estero Park or “expanding” Sueno Orchard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are a lot of ecosystems [at the Sueno Orchard] that aren’t native to our ecosystem, so we want to do a lot of work to pursue those,” Torres said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Additionally, Padilla will be able to create tools that make it easier for researchers to organize information that is already available to them, such as email correspondence and documents in inaccessible formats.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">New Mac computers also made their debut in the Learning Commons earlier this summer, which are now the only Mac computers available on campus for general student use.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The installation of the six iMacs and three MacPros comes as part of the technology plan that came with the expansion of Davidson Library.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We feel that the Mac operating system is the best fit to accommodate for increasingly interdisciplinary coursework,” Rebecca Metzger, the library outreach coordinator, said. “It’s not unusual for a biology student to need a film editing program for a final class project, for instance.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Metzger, funding for the computers came from the library’s budget, mostly made up of state money and private donations. The library also plans to use $30,000 to $40,000 from the Class of 2016 senior class gift to install additional technology.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of the biggest plans for the upcoming school year is to address the compact space issue inside the library. Over 250,000 people visit the library every month, and this is expected to increase with one of the largest incoming freshman classes in history starting UCSB in fall 2016.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This year, library staff will focus on adding furniture and expanding late-night study to other parts of the building. The second floor Mountainside will become available Fall Quarter for late-night hours.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Metzger said she is currently working with UCSB’s Health &amp; Wellness Center to obtain two egg chairs for the library that will help promote relaxation during the demanding academic year.</p>\n<p>According to Metzger, improving the learning commons is an evolving process, and the library staff is always looking for student suggestions regarding technology needs and furniture needs. Suggestions can be submitted at the wooden boxes on the services desks or by emailing <i>outreach@library.ucsb.edu</i>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 22, 2016, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72571\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72571\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/","id":2709,"author":{"id":153,"name":"Gerardo Banuelos"},"related":[2708,2707,2706],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/153"}},"__N_SSG":true}
