","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coachella just keeps getting bigger. This year, not only were the grounds literally pushed outward on the far end, giving the Outdoor Theatre and Gobi and Mojave tents more room (and less bleed of audiences and sound from Sahara and the main stage), but over 20,000 more festival goers were admitted for each weekend. Also, two new, desert-themed tents were added (or a net of one tent, if you subtract James Murphy’s Despacio experience from last year): the punk and DIY-focused Sonora and the breathtaking digital art project, the Antarctic. As the music festival of music festivals grows up and out, with more feet stomping grass and more eyes looking in, it stakes more of a claim in California youth culture. So, Artsweek visited the fest this past weekend to take it all in and break it all down.</p>\n<p>Our generation’s rockstar, Mac DeMarco, won the Outdoor crowd over Friday afternoon with his trademark gap-toothed charm. Vibing effortlessly with his bandmates and friends, Joe, Jon and Andy, Mac’s playfulness was as infectious as ever. Lampooning both the culture of high-profile guest appearances at the fest and the culture of popular mediocrity, the band welcomed “Ed Sheeran” to the stage in the form of redheaded friend and former bassist Pierce McGarry, who displayed an affected British accent. Mac has earned this little jab; even as he continues to accrue more and more followers and influence, he’s continued to develop his talents. As he belted out the first “Oh baby” of one of his best and most rarely performed songs, “My Kind of Woman,” he displayed an almost stunning vocal acuity that stood out from his usual low talk-singing of shows past. His emphatic performance filled out the range of the song, and his increased singing chops paired with the comfortable tightness of his band made this an act not to miss over these weekends. UCSB class of 2016 alumnus Dar Sadeghi counted himself a fan after the set, saying that he thought it was “the best I’ve seen this weekend.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77384\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1133129271\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77382\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77384\" data-attachment-id=\"77384\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/img-665384-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?fit=1803%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1803,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Img-665384\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77384\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?w=1803&amp;ssl=1 1803w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77384\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Do LaB</p></div>\n<p>Thank you, bass god. Thundercat started late in the Mojave on Saturday, probably just because he was busy anointing his magic fingers for the show. When he took the stage, TCat was rocking his irreverent style with a gothic, cartoon-villain gargoyle headdress complete with horns, wings, gilded demon-skull shoulder pads and what looked like rondels made of shrunken nun heads. Despite the get-up, the virtuoso’s skills spoke for themselves as he slapped and plucked his six-string’s way through jams like “Heartbreaks + Setbacks” and “Them Changes.” Musician-comedian Reggie Watts joined Thundercat and his pair of bandmates (a pianist/synth player and a drummer) for a few vocal riffs, but his mic was off through the first chunk of his performance. Some more sound issues affected the set, such as the low ends of the bass being too high and drowning some other sounds out, but the remarkable skill and gusto on display compensated. Thundercat wound down with a medley of songs he helped produce for other artists, leading Flying Lotus’s “MmmHmm” into Kendrick Lamar’s “Complexion” and back again.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the most impressive acts to inaugurate the new Sonora tent was a punk act out of Rhode Island called Downtown Boys. Their performance burst with radically political energy, with lead singer Victoria Ruiz calling for the redistribution of power and wealth and the end of white supremacy in between her bouts of wild shaking, bouncing and bilingual chanting of songs like “(Brown and Smart)” and their sax-heavy Springsteen cover “Dancing In The Dark.” As their Saturday set of weekend two coincided with Earth Day and the March for Science across the nation, the band led a small march of their own “toward the phallic-looking sculptures and back.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, the Yuma tent hosted a superset with pro DJs Floating Points, Daphni (aka Caribou) and Four Tet. The three spent time mixing and trading off at the helm, experimenting with each other’s beats and basslines to make new permutations of house for the lab mice in the crowd to boogie down to. All three are modern powerhouses of the genre in their own right, so their collaboration proved a pleasure to shake it to.</p>\n<p>Like the man of the hour, Kendrick, would later on Sunday night, DC rapper GoldLink tore down the lamely common discussion of whether live rappers can put on a good show. GoldLink hosted a party in the Mojave, starting with a few songs of his own in front of flashing traffic light props before MCing a breakdown of age-old hits to bring up the hype level, including hitting a mean air guitar riff to “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” Link wasted no time getting right back to “the regularly scheduled programming,” performing “Late Night” with Masego and “Some Girl” with Steve Lacy, who went on to perform his own song “Ryd.” It was a good weekend for Lacy, the guitarist of The Internet, who would later be given a shoutout by Kendrick himself after his performance of “Pride,” which Lacy co-produced.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77385\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"793888451\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77382\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77385\" data-attachment-id=\"77385\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/4-21-17_coachella-dolab05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?fit=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1363\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77385\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77385\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Do LaB</p></div>\n<p>Like in Justice’s flawless set the following night, you could feel the Franco-groove DNA Breakbot shares with Daft Punk flowing through their showstopping performance in the Gobi. Though Breakbot is technically the solo project of Thibaut Jean-Marie Michel Berland, the full band that joined the leveled tiers of his picturesque stage set-up filled out the lush, energetic sound of his songs. Vocalists Irfane and Yasmin matched and cranked up the vigorous boogie of their audience, maintaining crystal clear vocals while dancing in step with the guitarist and bassist. Yasmin and Irfane (in his salmon pink suit matching Berland’s all-white one) balanced the stoic expertise of Berland on the keys, and by the time they broke into their hit “Baby I’m Yours,” everyone in the crowd had tossed their inhibitions off like the sweat on their brows.</p>\n<p>One of the most anticipated performers of the weekend, legendary composer Hans Zimmer brought “a cello concerto to the desert,” and then some. With over 30 people on stage, including a full orchestra and choir, Zimmer led the Outdoor audience through intricate arrangements of scores from movies like “The Lion King,” “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Inception.” Though perhaps not everyone in the festival crowd was ready for Cellochella, as depending on where you were standing the people around you might’ve continued their roaring babble over the performance.</p>\n<p>The act that everyone was waiting for all weekend blew Coachella away on Sunday night. Kendrick Lamar, indisputably the greatest rapper of our time, had an easy go cementing his pinnacled place in not only the game but in his genre, his art and his work. Decked out in matching black-and-white Chinese martial arts uniforms to fit the Kung Fu Kenny persona carried through DAMN., he launched mercilessly into cuts from the new album and classics alike. Lamar rapped “DNA.,” “XXX.” and “ELEMENT.” with as much finesse and precision as “Backseat Freestyle,” “untitled 02” and his remix of “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe.” The weekend two crowd was privileged with a little more time to learn all the new lyrics. Kendrick interluded his show with campy, old-school style clips of Kung Fu Kenny on a mystic journey for ass and self-realization. The commitment to the (slightly questionable) character puts Kendrick in the frame of an artist with eras, phases of a long and storied career.</p>\n<p>But Coachella is also about the art (guys, it’s, like, in the name).</p>\n<p>The Antarctic, a “360° audio-visual sensory experience” by San Francisco studio Obscura Digital, was easily one of the most landmark attractions (musical or otherwise) to hit the fest in years. Known for large-scale projection mapping projects on canvases like the Empire State Building and St. Peter’s Basilica, the Obscura team brought the display of their show to the desert. Audiences filled up an air-conditioned dome for a planetarium show tricked out with innovative computer graphics tech and tripped out with breathtakingly morphing psychedelic imagery. It launched viewers up out of the desert Space Mountain-style, into intricately dreamlike landscapes with floating shapes, both organic and geometric, until eventually blurring the lines between the two past the point of differentiation. This breaking down of the barrier between the natural and the mathematical was appropriate in a space so simultaneously rawly human and exhaustively digitized as Coachella.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77386\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1219748817\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77382\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77386\" data-attachment-id=\"77386\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/4-21-17_coachella-dolab01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?fit=2048%2C1408&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1408\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?fit=250%2C172&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?fit=888%2C611&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77386\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01-250x172.jpg?resize=250%2C172\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"172\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?resize=250%2C172&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?resize=768%2C528&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?resize=1024%2C704&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77386\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Do LaB</p></div>\n<p>The Antarctic revived the kineticism of Coachella art, which was missing on the field this and last year, in the digital zone (it acknowledged this self-referentially by folding into its fourth-dimensional collage some iconic figures of years past: the caterpillar, butterfly and spaceman that moved across the grounds like giant floats). This forces the question of how much of the festival, and how much of our lives, exists within the digital space and to what degree we consider that part of an objective sense of reality. There was, appropriately, a lot of heady stuff in all those planes of color and fractals. Said one UCSB third-year, “From now on, whenever I trip I’m gonna call it ‘going to the Antarctic.’” However, he was upset that after hitting the dome three times in one day he “still never got uploaded to the singularity.”</p>\n<p>“Is this what brings things into focus?” is the name for the boxy herd of multi-patterned creatures that populated your Instagram feed this week. They were built by U.K. artists Joanne Tatham and Tom O’Sullivan. In person, these grazing six-story monsters were much more towering than photos could do justice to, playing with the scope and perspective of an actual event and the hyper-documentation of it. Compounded with the outward expansion of the festival’s grounds, these monumental sculptures gave one a tilt-shifted impression of their small space on the fields. No matter how big you look in that photo, at Coachella you’re a drop in a wave.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/","id":6805,"author":{"id":703,"name":"Frankie Horne"},"related":[6804,6803,6802],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Arrival’ Makes a Smooth Landing at Pollock","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=384%2C600&ssl=1","description":"'Arrival' stresses the coming together of people in spite of differences, the circularity and recurring connections of all things.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Carsey-Wolf center kicked off their winter season on Tuesday with a Script To Screen event featuring recent first contact thriller “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arrival”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a critical and box office success. After a screening of the film in Pollock Theater, host Matt Ryan was joined by screenwriter Eric Heisserer, a composed and genial personality who balanced interesting bits of background info with light banter that played well with the eager audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Readers should be warned that the stories Heisserer shared to supplement the film do, of course, spoil its brilliantly round plot, so those yet to enjoy it may wish to quit reading here. Those that may not wish to quit may wish to reconsider; “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arrival” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presents a layered story that warrants and rewards a couple of considerate watches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adapted from Ted Chiang’s 1998 novella “ Story of Your Life,” the film follows Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a renowned linguistics professor tasked with helping the government communicate with the uncannily foreign alien lifeforms that have alighted on a Montanan plain (among 11 other locations around the globe). Heisserer spoke on the “hat trick” that Chiang’s story hit him with, where he felt “just gutted and tearful and a little joyous at the same time,” wondering “how can I inflict a wide audience with this?”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the alien and international tensions presented, the emotional core of the story lies in the doomed relationship between Louise and her daughter, revealed in scenes that appear to be flashbacks at the film’s prologue and throughout its story, but take on a new light at its conclusion. “The first five pages and the last five pages stayed the same” throughout the writing process, Heisserer said, pointing repeatedly to the centrality of this tragic relationship as the movie’s rhetorical and emotional heart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of this cathartic punch included aging down Louise’s daughter Hannah, who dies in the film from disease rather than the youthful recklessness of the original story. But Heiserrer noted how this decision was a matter of production as well as emotion: because of the reveal that (and once more, major spoilers follow) Louise’s flashbacks are in fact flashforwards due to the Tralfamadorian nonlinear perception of time imparted by learning the language of the heptapods, they would’ve had to age Amy Adams up, disrupting their own reveal had they let her daughter make it a little longer. “That blows everything,” Heisserer observes, going on to comment on the nature of her character’s temporally-questionable decision to have a child who she knows will die young that “it may be deterministic but we’re unaware of that, we still feel like we have choice.” He finds this paradox of determinism and free will makes Louise’s decision to raise her doomed daughter even more emotionally profound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the tricky way the script plays with time and audience assumptions, Adams’ opportunities for subtlety in her portrayal of Louise were numerous. Heisserer cherished her skill, attesting, “when you have a phenomenal actor that embodies a role for you, you find out just how little dialogue at places you actually need.” This plays out in subsequent viewings for those who’ve already learned the truths of heptapod thinking, and even Heisserer commented, “I certainly still find myself discovering things in Amy Adam’s performance that I didn’t catch in earlier screenings.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74817\" style=\"width: 394px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"849367051\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74816\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74817\" data-attachment-id=\"74817\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/arrivalposter/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?fit=384%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"384,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"arrivalposter\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?fit=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?fit=384%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74817 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=384%2C600\" alt=\"Courtesy of Pollock Theater\" width=\"384\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?w=384&amp;ssl=1 384w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74817\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Pollock Theater</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another change Heisserer made during adaptation included increasing the military presence for dramatic tension’s sake, and along those same lines, the actual arrival of the seven-legged, hand-squid hybrid heptapods, themselves. Heisserer spoke of how in Chiang’s story the heptapods contact humanity via Skype-like technology, but how there’s “no tension at all there;” “what does that do geopolitically,” he asks, when the aliens arrive at our front door?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The writer spoke about changes he made during his own process as well. For a long while, the “gift” the heptapods intend to endow humanity with comprised not of their language and its time-transcendent influence, but of “different pieces of technology to make a ship so that we could… venture off and explore the stars on our own… and then </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interstellar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> came out.” Aside from not wanting to hijack another film’s motif, Heisserer and director Denis Villeneuve didn’t want to leave their audiences with the impression that humanity had screwed up irrevocably; indeed, they opted instead to champion human cooperation and unity, reinforced by the circular, complexly interrelated nature of the alien language that fosters it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Ryan, joking about being unable to place graphics in scriptwriting software Final Cut, asked about the presentation of the logograms of the heptapod language on paper, Heisserer mentioned being wary of getting too novelistic in his descriptions about them. Spurred by a suggestion from his wife, he left spaces in the script and inserted the graphics manually. “I did that a hundred times,” he remarked, “I’m an idiot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heiserrer described working with Villeneuve as “phenomenal.” In his previous experience, handing a script to a director “feels more like, sort of a hostage tradeoff on a bridge.” Imitating one of these past directors, he joked “maybe I’ll remember your name at the premier.” But Villeneuve was different. Heisserer described the long courtship period before the director attached himself to the project, where they would sit at coffee shops discussing philosophy, science, and religion. After five or six of these intellectual dates, he received a call from his new friend; imitating the director’s French-Canadian accent, he recounts the conversation that made the movie happen: “Ok Eric, now we are married.” The amount of care Villeneuve poured into the project really impressed Heisserer, citing him as the only director to give him calls to check the soundness of any changes he planned on making. This care carried throughout their Montreal crew. According to the writer, even the gaffers and grips read his script, creating a productive environment where “we were all trying to make the same movie.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This crew unity was appropriate then, as “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arrival” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stresses the coming together of people in spite of differences, the circularity and recurring connections of all things. The details Heisserer shared with the intrigued audience Tuesday night elucidated this and more, proving a revelatory experience in line with a course of Heptapod 101.</span><br>\n<span

In addition to the literary power of Lamar, the lineup features the raw edge of Denzel Curry, stark honesty of Vince Staples and unabashed braziness of Young Thug. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fans of boogying to the thump-thumps will be delighted to groove to the spinnings of DJs like Gold Panda and Todd Terje along with the distinctive fare of artists like Oneohtrix Point Never and Floating Points (who will be playing both live and DJ sets). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re into shit made with instruments or are bemoaning FYF’s bygone days as a punk bastion, don’t trip.
