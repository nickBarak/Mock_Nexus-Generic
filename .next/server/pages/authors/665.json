touring dates after the 2017 release of “The OOZ,” British underground indie idol Archy Marshall, better known by his alias King Krule, delivers “Man Alive!”: an unfiltered album raw with depression and disillusionment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Characterized by a blend of jazz and post-rock influences, “Man Alive!” — released Feb. 21 on True Panther Sounds/Matador Records —</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maintains much of the aesthetic identity found on Marshall’s previous releases, while bringing forth an unprecedented and straightforward approach to the struggles that plague his psyche in order to offer an honest meditation on mental health in a postmodern society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On tracks like “(Don’t Let the Dragon) Draag On,” Marshall finds himself losing in a battle between the knowledge of his own self-destructive tendencies and his desire to numb his pain, however fleeting the cure may be.  As he reflects on habits of self-medication, Marshall’s mutters are deep and in constant decay; he has given up on finding any savior as he resigns to those around him: “Better off just leaving me this way.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction

drum machines, Marshall’s struggle is further mirrored on cuts like “Cellular” in which he falls deeper into depression and finds himself sinking into the world around him.  Unable to escape the realities of modern life, he likens his own afflictions to an increasingly mediated society, wailing, “Below the ground floor/We’re losing signal, we’ve lost connection.”</span></p>\n<div

id=\"caption-attachment-93204\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Consequence of Sound</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state of Marshall’s mental health seems unmistakably linked to his perception of the ailments of the larger society that surrounds him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he meditates on escapism through the metaphor of flight — a theme found throughout much of his discography, with a chemtrail as the album cover for “The OOZ” — even Marshall’s dreams of safe haven are marred by an industrialized society as he resigns that “chemtrails poke holes through commuters.” Marshall is claustrophobic, without even the sky to turn to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His disgust with society’s technological dependency (and perhaps his own) and his aversion to a growing corporate reality in his own London neighborhood take center stage on tracks like “Stoned Again.” Assuming the most confrontational tone of all of “Man Alive!,” ”Stoned Again” highlights Marshall’s frank and unapologetic lyricism at its best.  Bellowing “the cars on my road almost hit me in a hurry/The cars are just a sign of another yuppie,” Marshall’s feelings for the young, middle-class professionals, some of whom he finds himself engaging with, are nothing short of disgust; the track’s gritty bass the only rival to his cement-thick vocals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite all that anguishes him, Marshall is still able at times to approach matters from a more hopeful perspective.  Welcoming his newborn daughter into the world with his long-time partner, Charlotte Patmore, halfway through the production of “Man Alive!,” Marshall’s desire to impart a sense of positivity on those around him is evident on bittersweet cuts like “Alone, Omen 3.” Complete with a music video featuring a suit-clad Archy Marshall singing at the camera in the midst of a busy metropolis, “Alone, Omen 3” examines the inconsequential aspects of life in the city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marshall’s comfort in the aimless is revealed in his newfound hope for the future of his family as he states, “You’re the omen of paradise.” And as the words “don’t forget you’re not alone” repeat upon the track’s end, Marshall walks into the distance with his partner and his daughter, the final lyric a perfect message to himself and his family, hinting that for once, just maybe, things are not so grave for one of London’s most morose artists.  </span></p><div

characterized much of Rex’s earlier work into a polished album packaged for easy consumption—and loses much of Rex’s personality in the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

themes of pain and heartbreak that comprise much of the album. The meaning behind the track’s repetitive refrain “I did it again” is left completely unknown and is overwhelmingly unimaginative, with the track’s lyrics being a series of equally unrelated and vague concepts flurrying between aspirations of self-improvement and feelings of regret.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rex’s tepid act of dancing around the dark subject matter that characterizes much of “Pony”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is similarly evident on cuts like “Face To Face,” which finds Rex simply recalling “We stayed up, I threw up in that house” as perhaps the boldest and most descriptive line on the album—a feat to no true accomplishment.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Calling out directly the pitfalls of selfish friendship, Rex reflects, “They wanna lie and still be friends / But when you’re at your worst, they’re not there,” and highlights the vulnerability that comes with fame and wealth as he sings, “They wanna take what’s yours / They wanna go for dinner on your name / I let them take control and take me for a fool.” Thus Rex seems capable of calling things as they are, but at a track length of only one minute and 45 seconds long, the song seems like a brief idea that was never fully fleshed out, fading to an unsatisfying end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such is also the case in piano ballad “Every Way,” which finds its strength in the singer-songwriter aesthetic that first brought Rex to fame as he professes with the intimacy of a private conversation between two lovers, “I think about you in every single way.” Still, the track comes across as more of a brief motif than a full song as it concludes at just over two minutes. It’s as though Rex has nothing more to say on the matter that seems most personal to him, or would otherwise prefer not to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is only upon the album’s closing track, “It’s Not The Same Anymore,” that Rex’s raw intimacy is fully realized and aptly explored. Further struggling with the pressure of fame and growing into adulthood, Rex meditates over haunting acoustic guitar, “I lost the joy in my face / My life was simple before.” Rex looks dead in the eyes of that which he only alluded to for the previous 30 minutes of “Pony,” and upon the album’s conclusion it becomes clear that for the artist and the music itself, “It’s not the same anymore.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91319\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-20/in-review-pony-by-rex-orange-county/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91319\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-20/in-review-pony-by-rex-orange-county/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-20/in-review-pony-by-rex-orange-county/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-20/in-review-pony-by-rex-orange-county/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-20/in-review-pony-by-rex-orange-county/","id":6559,"author":{"id":665,"name":"Jake Einsiedl"},"related":[6558,6557,6556],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mt.

Eddy.  Looking for a third member to round off the duo, Chris brought in his brother Enzo who juggled bass and guitar duties, often switching instruments halfway through sets.  Still under the name Jakob Danger and seeking a more complete feel, the band brought in Judd, asking him to join while under the impression that he actually knew how to play bass. And with the long sought after final addition, the band solidified its roster and recorded its debut album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chroma</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a collective effort under their newly established moniker.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although producing a modest crowd turnout at the Velvet Jones, what was lost in numbers was made up in passion. With loyal fans singing along to easily accessible hooks and the entire crowd head-bobbing to the smooth listening that is much of the band’s appeal, Mt. Eddy created an infectious community, making the concertgoers experience less about watching and more about participating.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthems like “Song and Fury” allowed those unfamiliar to the track to quickly catch on to its lyrics and sing along. Heavier songs like title track “Chroma” seamlessly switched from playfully shouted choruses to Malaspina’s drum-dominated breakdowns all too suited for the crowd’s heavy mosh pits. Perhaps it is this dynamic nature that makes the band so appealing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the songwriting, the band said, “It’s  mostly Jakob, but we change the parts for our respective instruments.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performing two unreleased tracks from a three-track EP set to release on March 11, Armstrong said to the crowd: “We’re gonna try to play a new song that Kevin learned on the drive here. So be gentle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each member’s personal presence on both songs is clear, with one track relying on a riff-soaked chorus led by Enzo and another with isolated vocals highlighting the complementary contrast of the rugged and the soft from Armstrong and Judd, respectively.  With the expressive drum stylings of jazz-trained drummer Chris, it’s no wonder why every song feels so complete and every fan seems so loyal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between the gifts, pleas for their setlist and screams from adoring fans, the relatively new band seems unphased. As for Armstrong, familiarity with fame and big names in the music industry is something he has lived with his whole life. With an album mixed by Grammy-winning audio engineer Chris Dugan, who Armstrong merely refers to as “my Dad’s friend,” it’s clear Armstrong’s background let him get his foot in the door of the music industry, and his independent musical talent allowed that door to stay open for future projects.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s this talent that created enough chaos to make the half-full Velvet Jones feel packed to the brim. With spilled drinks slicking the floor, sweaty faces shining in the light and surprise pushes from spur of the moment mosh pits, Mt. Eddy proved all you need is the music to forget yourself and enjoy the moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With half the band in high school and the other half in college, juggling touring and school has proved increasingly difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all starting to miss more and more school to play shows,” Judd explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the impending release of a new EP, it seems opportunity for touring will only grow.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Branching out from touring with many of the Bay Area bands they are most associated with, Armstrong explained, “In Oakland we play the same venues with the same general bands. We just ask our friend’s bands to play. Now we’re submitting for different tours with different bands.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking towards the future and contemplating the ever-subjective concept of genre, Armstrong said, “We’re writing all sorts of stuff … I think we’re heading towards surf rock but we’re also not … We’re definitely not straight punk.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some time went by until they all resolved, “We don’t know. That’s the answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still in the beginning of their career, Mt. Eddy has a lot of time to find that answer, and as long as they keep putting out music, we’ll have time to listen.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/","id":5724,"author":{"id":665,"name":"Jake Einsiedl"},"related":[5723,5722,5721],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/665"}},"__N_SSG":true}
