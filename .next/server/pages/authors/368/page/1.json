Spoilers ahead.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t be fooled by the title. While “Never Have I Ever” may sound like an otherwise banal and dry teen show from the name, the show presents so much more for the representation of women of color in television and a fresh realistic storyline for a culturally diverse audience. Each episode’s title is clever, as it starts with “Never Have I Ever” and ends in a hint as to what tumultuous conflict will come to fruition in the next episode. As a half-Indian viewer, I was intrigued to see how the show would represent Indian culture — particularly Indian stereotypes that have </span><a href=\"https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/198683\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pervaded media culture in the past</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Would this show extend beyond the nerd stereotypes that suffuse Indian culture? The answer is not simple, but one that is craftily developed by popular Indian-American creator Mindy Kaling, who based the show loosely on her own childhood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pilot season consists of 10 thirty-minute episodes, which turned out to be a good condition for a five-hour binge-fest on my sofa. The show is definitely geared toward younger audiences, as the characters are all in high school and the plot revolves largely around a teen romance between 15-year-old main character Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and jock Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet). While this seems like an otherwise familiar coming-of-age storyline, the show challenges the topic of lust based purely on attraction, something refreshing to see in a young-adult comedy. The conversation about Devi’s impending loss of virginity is thrown into disarray between Devi’s own inner-reluctance and constant surveillance from Devi’s mom (Poorna Jagannathan). While this comedic element consumes the plot, other dilemmas in the show confront grief in the loss of Devi’s father, her sudden paralysis and the comeback into her sophomore year with her two best friends Eleanor (Ramona Young) and Fabiola (Lee Rodriguez). </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ramakrishnan’s breakout performance as Devi brings a unique spark to the show, as her wit, intelligence and humor are coupled with her endless deflection of the loss of her father, until she reaches an emotional break. Her sought-after vision is to live a normal teenage life, which is disrupted by the harsh parenting of her mother, which allows Indian viewers to relate to the strict but loving parenting style of Indian parents. However, Devi’s mother proves to be a multi-dimensional character as well, whose choices are understandable from her own emotional trauma. Devi’s life events are humorously and uniquely narrated by tennis legend John McEnroe, which might seem odd at first, but is later justified in the show’s storyline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other notable characters include Devi’s goody-two-shoes cousin Kamala (Richa Moorjani), who is portrayed as the “beautiful” and “innocent” member of the family, a doctorate student at CalTech who is hesitantly preparing for an arranged marriage. While Devi is constantly sparring with her family, she soon realizes that her rejection of Indian cultural norms is something she shares with Kamala, more than she may initially realize. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her wealthy academic competitor Ben (Jaren Lewison) is originally depicted as an antagonist who will do anything to one-up Devi, but a character who sweetly turns out to be one of Devi’s greatest allies and who faces adolescent battles of his own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Devi’s best friends Eleanor and Fabiola rightfully get their own minor storylines, weaved in seamlessly to the challenges high schoolers face in regards to family and sexuality. These plot points sometimes clash with Devi’s own self-absorbed attitude, which contributes to major highs and lows in their collective friendship. In a way, the show serves as an enlightening awakening in each of the three friend’s lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to Indian culture, “Never Have I Ever” may have some eye-roll moments for Indian audiences, especially in the reference of Priyanka Chopra as the epitome of “Indian beauty” multiple times in the series. Similarly, the characterization of Devi as the stereotypical sexually undesirable geek is a bit tiresome to see in such a diverse show. However, the charming moments present in the series definitely outweigh the Indian-American references crafted to appeal to the Americanized gaze. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Never Have I Ever” may westernize some elements of Indian culture but stands out in its portrayal of its main character: Devi adapts from an insecure high school teenager to a bold and risk-taking young adult. Devi’s ethnic background is an essential part of the show in how it shapes Devi’s shifting attitudes and uprise against omnipresent tradition. The show applies truthful elements of malicious behavior that stem from growing up and confronting our own inner demons, whether it’s an absent family in Ben’s case or the acceptance of loss in Devi’s. The series ends on an enlivening note in the neglect of fulfilling a perfect teenage fantasy in favor of growing to accept the reality of what makes us happy in our individual lives. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

I wasn’t vehemently against it, but I couldn’t help but reflect on my past terrible relationships and wonder humorously what the future would hold if I had married one of my exes. Marriage in college would be highly distracting and an obstacle I could not balance with the pressure of school. I similarly thought about my indecisiveness in college so far and some of my friends who have changed their major at least a dozen times. How can someone be that sure about committing to someone in college when so many aspects of a college student’s life are constantly up in the air? I’ve changed so much from one year to another, and I couldn’t imagine how much I would adapt to marriage during these formative years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are not just my reservations. It’s hard to think about the prospect of marriage in college when girls at universities are constantly tweeting about how they </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=text%20back&amp;src=typed_query\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“can’t get a text back.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Are there college students out there who are truly mature enough to be in a seriously committed — not to mention legally binding — relationship and are willing to be tied down for the rest of their lives at age 20? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, there have been various stories about couples who have gotten married in college — some heartwarming and others disheartening. Reading through a </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2v810z/guys_who_got_married_in_college_what_happened_how/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit thread</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of couples who married in college, I was amazed by how many couples got married in their first or second year of college and who have been together for 10, maybe even 20 years since then, living together happily with kids. Of course, some weren’t as lucky and ended up divorcing because their life paths inevitably moved in very different directions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I myself have a few friends who have gotten married right when they hit college — all married to guys enlisted in the military. It is not unexpected that military marriages occur right before deployment because of </span><a href=\"https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/clarksville/2014/12/11/married-military-look-inside-young-military-marriages/20263373/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-term separation, among other factors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. My best friend from middle school and the better half of high school ended up getting married at the end of high school, which I could have never imagined happening. One moment, I could remember us running around in her neighborhood (quite literally) chasing after a boy we both liked, and the next, she had a serious boyfriend for four years whom she married in a small ceremony. It was a shock to my system, especially since she ultimately ended up giving up a lot of her dreams for him, like dropping out of college and forgoing her veterinary aspirations to live with him in California where he is stationed. But ultimately, I did know one thing: She loved being with him, no matter the cost. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships in young adulthood are so dynamic and clouded by uncertainty. One day, you could be celebrating your birthday with your best friend, and the next year, she’s gone from your life without so much as a “happy birthday” text. If you can find a built-in best friend in a marital partner during the craziness that is college, that is definitely something to cherish. Having someone who is a constant in your life, with whom you can share the exciting and devastating moments is comforting, to say the least. It’s nice to have someone who won’t outgrow you.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think part of the problem people have with college students getting married is that we have become a largely judgemental society. We adhere to an unrealistic timeline of when major life events should “ideally” occur that defines what is and is not socially acceptable. Not only is this timeline plastered </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-age-to-get-married-is-26-2017-2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all over the internet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it is also ingrained in familial expectations: Graduate college, get a job, get married somewhere between the ages of 24-28 and have kids before 35. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need to reflect on our predisposed notions of how others should live their lives. Because at the end of the day, who should really care if you’re breaking the norm? If you found the right person that brings you immense happiness — why wait?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, college students are constantly evolving and maturing, often for the first time on their own. I definitely have experienced personal growth from high school to college when it comes to seeing the red flags in my relationships. I’ve witnessed the dissolution of some of my friends’ romantic relationships as a consequence of misunderstanding each other or having stark contrasting visions for their futures. I believe that at the end of the day, if someone is in your life who accepts you fundamentally and wants to grow with you, they’re worth holding onto. Marriage at a young age can ultimately contribute to a unique perspective that can yield purpose and focus that others won’t experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will not deny that my personality trait of being a hopeless romantic has contributed to my altered stance on marriage in college. While I haven’t been involved in the healthiest romantic relationships and have yet to date a guy who has truly cherished and accepted me for the person I am, I’ve seen deep respect in a relationship form almost effortlessly in couples around me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve seen the spark blow out in a relationship of mine and reignite with someone new just as fast as the next week. People enter our lives at very fateful moments, and when we individually decide to get married should ultimately depend on individual circumstances — not outside influences or societal expectations.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai encourages you to make individualized decisions independent of socially constructed ideals. </span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94091\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94091\" data-attachment-id=\"94091\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-01/argument-in-the-office-married-during-college/college-marriage-opinion/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"college marriage opinion\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94091\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-94091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Melody Wang / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Say No To the Dress</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Sara Rubin</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Picture this. You are standing in an aisle, staring at the love of your life while your friends and family watch you take a vow that will last for eternity. During my childhood, I was ingrained with the idea of a magical fairytale wedding. Disney Princess movies gave me a conventional and outdated model. They filled me with hopes that my prince charming would one day rescue me with a kiss. Later in life, romantic movies taught me that at the end of the day, love always wins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, I am nearing almost 20 years old, and the fantasy wedding I used to dress my Barbie dolls up for is the furthest thing from my mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not that I have stopped believing in love. I still hold on to the notion that one day I will find my knight in shining armor. But while taking marriage vows and having a family are important to me, I could never imagine committing myself to someone for the rest of my life in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s begin by assuming that one has already met the love of their life this early. The first point I would like to emphasize is how young and inexperienced we all are. Most of us have never owned our own apartment or house, have never had a full time job and don’t know what it is like to be 100% independent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newfound freedom we experience in college is an important stepping stone towards becoming full-fledged adults. However, if one decides to get married at this young age, they are skipping past the growth and change you experience when you are forced to stand on your own two feet. Life is full of uncertainties, and while having someone by your side is a constant that can bring comfort, you are also hindering your capability to rely on yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strength and new skills one acquires when living on their own can help prepare a person for the uncertainties that can be thrown at them in the future. This dependence on another can lead one to forgo taking responsibility for their own actions, as they will always expect someone else to help them with their mistakes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, one never learns how to accept being alone. My grandmother always told me that “we must be the center of our own universe, because the one constant in our lives is ourselves.” As college students, we are experiencing a pivotal and impressionable time in our lives, and if we don’t learn how to not only accept but enjoy being alone, then we will never have the strength to get through life with just ourselves. Self-love and self-confidence are what drive us to reach for our dreams, and to be happy with who we are. That is a rather difficult goal to achieve when someone else provides emotional security for you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would also like to point out how important exposing oneself to different relationships is. While I have dated a few people already, I would not feel ready to commit the rest of my life to another person without going through at least a few more heartbreaks. Relationships teach us important lessons regarding life, and help us find out who we truly are. Marriage is a huge step, and I know I will need more practice being in  relationships before taking it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dating also shows us what qualities we want in a partner, and what qualities we don’t. These lessons are a gift that help reveal more of who we are. Not many other circumstances in life can better demonstrate one’s strength than having to overcome a breakup. To have that history is imperative. When we finally find the person we want to be with, we will have learned from our past and understood what it takes to really make a relationship work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this time in our lives we are undergoing massive changes. Grad schools or job offers can be across the country from one another, and it’s difficult to pick up your whole life and move when another person is involved. If your partner keeps you from pursuing your full potential, you may begin to resent one another. Sacrifice is often needed for a marriage to work; however, to forgo such big opportunities is unfair for everyone involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These changes occur in ourselves as well. I often hear adults say that the person they were in college is nothing like the person they are today. We mature and learn an abundance of lessons during this period and sometimes the individual you marry will not be the same person years later. This “metamorphosis” can change how two people work together, and turn a once-perfect marriage sour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, this argument is not to deter people from marrying altogether. I write this as a cautionary tale for those who desire to get married at this young age.

400;\">Warning! Spoilers ahead.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first heard about Netflix’s upcoming new release, “Outer Banks,” I was drawn in from just the title. The story is, you guessed it, set in the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Banks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outer Banks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a chain of barrier islands off the coast of North Carolina known for their small-town vibe and picturesque beaches. As someone who has grown up in South Carolina, I often took spontaneous trips to the infamous “Outer Banks.” It’s the kind of place where people “either have two jobs or two houses,” according to the show’s main character John B. Ironically, the series “Outer Banks” </span><a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/article242210291.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was not filmed in the Outer Banks at all</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but in Charleston, South Carolina, a similar setting to the Outer Banks in landscape and culture. From just the title alone, the series had potential for me, which I soon discovered measured up to a blend of dramas like “Gossip Girl,” “The O.C.” and other fan favorites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series revolves around a 17-year-old teen named John B. Rutledge (Chase Stokes), who recruits his three best friends to search for a legendary gold treasure that is associated with the mystery of his father’s disappearance at sea. John B. and his insanely attractive best friends, JJ (Rudy Pankow), Kiara (Madison Bailey) and Pope (Jonathan Daviss), make up the “Pogues,” aka the poor outsiders of the island. The other half of the island consists of the “Kooks,” the wealthy elite that includes John B’s love interest, Sarah Cameron (Madelyn Cline). Sarah’s father, Ward Cameron (Charles Esten), is a seemingly innocent character also interested in finding the treasure. The other Kooks on the island, including Sarah’s initial boyfriend Topper (Austin North) and his friends, will do anything to disrupt the Pogues’ day-to-day activities.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The first two episodes are lackluster at best, but the series quickly picks up and is hard to turn away from. While the episodes revolve largely around the central storyline of the treasure hunt, the loyal crew encounters many other setbacks, which include (but are not limited to) drug dealers, a blind woman with a shotgun, being pushed off of a 20-foot balcony and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these may appear like seemingly ridiculous adventures, watching them makes viewers feel like they are a part of the outlandish ride. The story could easily hit a lot of dead ends, but the sequential clues John B. and his friends discover in relation to his father’s vanishing allow us to think that the squad is merely one step away from finding the life-changing pot of gold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development of the Pogue characters is cleverly captivating, as they all have dynamic personalities that could reflect a real-life group of teenage friends. This includes John B. having no real guardian while being the leader of the group and his best friend JJ who faces recurring monetary and familial issues. Contrastingly, Kiara is the rich girl trying to justify her position within the Pogue group, and Pope is the whip-smart, morally righteous character who wants to stay out of trouble to protect his potential for a college scholarship.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94215\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1943847636\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94212\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94215\" data-attachment-id=\"94215\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/outer-banks-does-netflixs-new-east-coast-teen-drama-live-up-to-the-hype/netflix1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?fit=800%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Netflix1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?fit=800%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94215\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?resize=800%2C400\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?resize=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netflix1.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94215\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last three episodes could easily blend together, as they all follow the police chase of John B., who is mistaken as a fugitive at the peril of Ward’s malicious intentions. I almost threw something at my screen because I was hoping again and again that the villains would finally lose. This plea is due largely to the stark contrast between the morals and actions of the Pogues and Kooks that makes viewers deeply loathe the rich elites of the island. The ironic aspect of this cultural divide is that the struggle between the rich and the poor could easily morph into the reality of social class disunity in Charleston or the Outer Banks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this heavy conflict, the season wraps up nicely, but in a manner that draws some uncertainty in the future state of the Pogue crew. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While “Outer Banks” doesn’t present a plot that is holistically original, the nonstop adventure and suspenseful plot twists are enough to keep your eyes peeled. The young adult series gives viewers (especially UC Santa Barbara students) the comforting illusion that we are there alongside the characters, spending our days in the golden sunshine and ocean mist without a care in the world. If you’re in need of an engaging show worth binging or just some hot guys to watch on TV in this mind-numbing quarantine, I highly recommend indulging your addiction with “Outer Banks.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

The show follows characters Monse (Sierra Capri), Ruby (Jason Genao), Jamal (Brett Gray) and Cesar (Diego Tinoco), who confront very serious coming-of-age challenges, often addressing them in comedic ways. The show provides a refreshing story with a diverse cast and realistic plot but still provides constant drama, incorporates themes of love and tests the boundaries of friendships. I binged the first two seasons this past summer and am currently working on finishing season three — which was just released around a week ago.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93650\" style=\"width: 1000px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/on-my-block.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1329933956\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93650\" data-attachment-id=\"93650\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/on-my-block/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/on-my-block.jpg?fit=990%2C549&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"990,549\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"on my block\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/on-my-block.jpg?fit=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/on-my-block.jpg?fit=888%2C492&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93650\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/on-my-block.jpg?resize=888%2C492\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/on-my-block.jpg?w=990&amp;ssl=1 990w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/on-my-block.jpg?resize=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/on-my-block.jpg?resize=768%2C426&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93650\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of But Why Tho?</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>I Am Not Okay With This</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starring “It” kids Sophia Lillis and Wyatt Oleff, “I Am Not Okay With This” stands as a delightful blend of several cult favorites like “Carrie” and “Stranger Things,” to name a few. This show follows teen Sydney (Lillis) as she struggles to navigate the recent loss of her father, and even more recently, the discovery of her dangerous yet exciting telekinetic powers. Along the way, Syd faces issues like a fragmented relationship with her mother, a feeling of alienation from her peers and a journey to understand what her sexuality truly is. Beware, though: This show has just put out its first season comprised of seven episodes, which I binged in one sitting, and the ending is bound to leave you not only with an agape mouth but also with a hunger for more episodes.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93651\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"732412671\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93651\" data-attachment-id=\"93651\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/nyt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?fit=2048%2C1105&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1105\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NYT\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?fit=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?fit=888%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93651\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=888%2C479\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=1024%2C553&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?resize=1536%2C829&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NYT.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93651\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The New York Times</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Spinning Out </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Spinning Out” is a show I was skeptical of at first because it follows a very familiar and banal storyline — the high-strung athlete struggling to keep their life together in an effort to have a balanced life. However, “Spinning Out” has quickly become a fan favorite, following a figure skating Olympic hopeful who navigates family, love and, more importantly, her mental health, as her competitive drive almost breaks her. I recommend this show because it develops an interesting backstory of figure skater Kat Baker (Kaya Scodelario) while addressing the importance of athletes’ struggles with mental health. While the story begins similarly to many other storylines, with Kat’s injury sparking a break that later introduces her to a new opportunity in figure skating, it raises many real-world issues that not only athletes face but young adults in general. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93652\" style=\"width: 938px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1313215425\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93652\" data-attachment-id=\"93652\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/hollywood-reporter/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?fit=928%2C523&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"928,523\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hollywood reporter\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93652\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?w=928&amp;ssl=1 928w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hollywood-reporter-1.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93652\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Hollywood Reporter</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Soundtrack</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Soundtrack” is not only a show for every music and dance-loving person out there but is also for those looking for a drama similar to “This Is Us” that seamlessly connects love stories between a group of people living in Los Angeles. While the song choices are questionable at times, the connection of the music to the emotional scenes and accompanying choreography enhance the show. It allows viewers to relate to personal “soundtracks” that help us get through various moments in our lives. The story primarily follows Nellie (Callie Hernandez) and Sam’s (Paul James) enticing love story, with other notable performances from Jenna Dewan and Christina Milian. The primary aspects that kept me watching were the thorough arc development of all the characters and my investment in the highs and lows of their shaky relationships. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93654\" style=\"width: 630px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"286983538\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93654\" data-attachment-id=\"93654\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/tvline/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?fit=620%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"620,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TVLine\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?fit=620%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93654\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?resize=620%2C420\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TVLine.jpg?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93654\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of TVLine</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Love Is Blind</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your guilty pleasure is any kind of reality TV dating show (like me), “Love Is Blind” is the show for you. The show ironically presents the term “blind dating” in a whole new realistic light, as 30 single people try to fall in love with one another without ever meeting face-to-face (perfect for quarantining!). In this way, the show freshly tries to allow relationships to be based purely on emotional connection instead of physical attraction. The show follows a speed-date format, where men can propose at any point they decide to and thereafter meet their partner in person. While I personally think it’s outrageous to be engaged to someone you’ve never met face-to-face, the show presents an entertaining twist and answers the question on all of our minds: “Is love really blind?” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93655\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2031443219\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93655\" data-attachment-id=\"93655\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/esquire/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Esquire\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93655\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Esquire.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Esquire</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, if you’re a fan of “Riverdale,” or dark dramas and horror in general, “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” is an adaptation worth watching. The dark coming-of-age show is a restructured story based on “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” that follows Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) in her duality as a half-witch, half-mortal standing against various supernatural forces. The rampant inclusion of dark humor, along with Shipka’s charming portrayal of Sabrina, are co-dependently what make the show intoxicating. The dynamic love triangle between Sabrina, Harvey (Ross Lynch) and Nick (Gavin Leatherwood) also helps to strengthen the series. Personally, I fervently enjoy the plotlines and pace of “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” more than those of “Riverdale.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93656\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1141863280\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93656\" data-attachment-id=\"93656\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/medium/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?fit=1200%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Medium\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?fit=888%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93656\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?resize=888%2C444\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?resize=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medium.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93656\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Medium</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>You</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although only two seasons in, “You” has quickly become a fan favorite. While I’m sure everyone and their mother have seen “You” by now, here is a final nudge to any of those who have not yet experienced the allure and adventure of Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgely). This show is a first-person account of Joe as he falls in love with beautiful women, places himself as a “savior” figure and quickly finds himself committing a plethora of crimes, all in the name of “love.” While the first season stands as more of a twisted and dark love story, the second season quickly transitions into more of a thriller, making it difficult not to binge the series in a couple of sittings. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93653\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"251532680\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93649\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93653\" data-attachment-id=\"93653\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-23/7-netflix-shows-to-watch-while-quarantining/new-york-post/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New York Post\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93653\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/New-York-Post.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93653\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The New York Post</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Kristina Valencia contributed to the “I Am Not Okay With This” and “You” sections of this article.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

I fittingly watched the movie in my bed on Valentine’s Day, again hopeful that it would live up to the book’s rollercoaster of emotions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lara Jean (Lana Condor) and Peter (Noah Centineo) are in the lusty beginnings of their relationship as the story begins: going on their first date, first family dinner, etc. Quickly, Lara Jean and Peter realize the presence of outside influences on their relationship </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which bring a few threats to their happiness as a couple. One of these threats happens to be Peter’s ex-girlfriend Gen; the other being the re-appearance of Lara Jean’s middle-school crush and letter-receiver John Ambrose McClaren (Jordan Fisher) back into her life. Lara Jean faces an inner conflict throughout the story, weighing whether to stay in her relationship with Peter or embark upon a new romantic conquest with John Ambrose. John Ambrose’s personality serves as the utter opposite of Peter’s, posing a substantial disruption to Lara Jean’s romance with Peter.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92860\" style=\"width: 1110px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2038633962\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92857\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92860\" data-attachment-id=\"92860\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-19/to-all-the-boys-p-s-i-still-love-you-does-it-live-up-to-the-hype/insider/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?fit=1100%2C825&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1100,825\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Insider\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92860\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?w=1100&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lara Jean (Lana Condor) and John Ambrose McClaren (Jordan Fisher) in “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You.” Courtesy of Insider</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actor Fisher’s entrance into the “To All the Boys” universe was a smart decision for the film franchise, as his portrayal of John Ambrose adds even more charm to the rom-com and adeptly convinces audiences why Lara Jean’s feelings began to resurface for her middle-school love interest in the first place. Similarly, the performance of Lana Condor alone keeps the film afloat, as her indecisive but genuine nature in the film helps develop her rightful portrayal of Lara Jean. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, Peter and Lara Jean’s relationship seems more strained in the movie than romantic, giving viewers a little less charm from Centineo than previously used to. Peter and Lara’s chemistry is what drew a lot of viewer attention from the first movie, this same chemistry somewhat lacking screen time in the sequel. This not only left me questioning why she chose Peter to be with in the end, but a lot of the </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=peter%20kavinsky&amp;src=typeahead_click\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter universe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well. The “P.S. I Still Love You” movie</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crafts the story in a way that makes John Ambrose seem like the rightful romantic choice in a drastically more obvious matter than in the book. This discrepancy is due to a lot more open-ended dialogue and interaction between Peter and Lara Jean being left out in the transition from book to film.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92858\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1705470290\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92857\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92858\" data-attachment-id=\"92858\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-19/to-all-the-boys-p-s-i-still-love-you-does-it-live-up-to-the-hype/mamamia/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mamamia\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92858 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92858\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lara Jean (Lana Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo) in “To All the Boys: P.S.

This game was an essential piece not only to the slow build of conflict between Peter and Lara Jean, but also one of the main ways in which she grows closer to John Ambrose. Lara Jean’s decision to choose Peter in the movie was one that was almost immediate after she kissed John Ambrose, a heavy alteration from the book where Lara Jean deliberates who she will choose for a steady amount of time after the kiss. Because of this, the ending seemed overwhelmingly rushed to deliver a happy finish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite wanting to see the film add more elements of the novel to give the plot more nuance in whole, the entertaining journey of the movie adaptation of “P.S. I Still Love You” stays satisfactory in that it is sequentially about trying to make Lara Jean’s relationship with Peter work, despite her doubts and insecurities. Lara Jean’s ending commitment to Peter shows her growth in character and maturity in her first relationship. While overall it may seem confusing to viewers that she didn’t choose John Ambrose, the message is about making a difficult but worthwhile decision to make a relationship work with someone you fell in love with in the first place — a message that a lot of young viewers can relate to. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

The film previously premiered at both the Boston Film Festival and the Alexandria Film Festival. The plot description was interesting on its own: Two friends, Luke and Wes, decide to travel up the West Coast to find Luke’s “one who got away.” Scenes shot in Isla Vista were featured in the film, with the crew hoping to capture some of “the magic of a DP Saturday night.” Writer and director Marc Carlini and Skoog discussed these aspects of the film.</p>\n<p>While it was initially hard to ask questions about a movie that I hadn’t seen prior to the interview, Carlini’s passion for his project was immediately apparent in discussing his motivation behind the story of the film: conveying that “stuck” feeling we all have at some point in our lives, confused about how to make a change in our lives for the durability of our future. The film stars Tommy Dewey (Wes) and François Arnaud (Luke), known respectively for their roles in “The Mindy Project” and “Blindspot.” Each main character faces his own perils, with Wes stuck in a demanding corporate career and Luke a starving artist. Wes drags Luke on a California coastal road trip to Portland to find Maggie (Nicole LaLiberte), Luke’s former almost-flame in college. Not surprisingly, the inspiration for this plot piece stemmed from Carlini’s own experience with a girl who lived in Portland.</p>\n<p>Carlini was adamant that the storyline of the film could appeal to UC Santa Barbara students in particular, not only because of the unique nostalgia of a weekend night in I.V. but also because of the atmosphere of the film — reminiscent of the “what now?” attitude that pervades us as college students as we navigate building a life after college that we’re passionate about. After watching the film, I echo his sentiment. Although the characters are in their mid30s, there is an essential message in the film that can appeal to college students in general about how growing up can be a time that is marked by the constant inner questioning of our own life choices.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Skoog’s experience as a student at UCSB and as a resident of Isla Vista inspired Carlini’s decision to include Isla Vista in the film, a location that is difficult to replicate in a Hollywood studio. Isla Vista is the first stop for the main characters in the film, and the cinematography alone was enough to leave me satisfied with the portrayal of our beloved college town as the film showcased shots of I.V. businesses, the beach (of course) and students skateboarding and biking the streets without a care in the world. The decision to include I.V. in the film was not one taken lightly, as Carlini did not want to delineate or perpetuate the stereotype of I.V. as just a “party town,” but as a town that contributed significance to the film. Carlini recounted his bewilderment at his first encounter with I.V. and how it evoked a dreamy vibe unlike typical college campuses. For filming, the crew had a group of students voluntarily throw a party at a house in I.V. that could’ve rightfully blended into a typical night on DP. The main characters, Wes and Luke, quickly befriend two girls from UCSB who tag along on their road trip to their next stop — Big Sur. Perhaps the most telling significance of including I.V. in the film was the wistful feeling that young adulthood, especially at UCSB, is an unparalleled experience and a stage of life that passes by fleetingly and without warning.</p>\n<p>Other notable locations featured in the film include Big Sur, San Francisco, Monterey and Crescent City. While the connection between the two main actors is undeniably authentic, the Pacific Coast Highway almost acts as a character within the story too, each stop on the California coast signifying a break in the emotional journey of the two characters. The detailed cinematography in the film takes an otherwise typical road trip and adds a magical essence. At the close of the film, the significance of location again arises as Luke has to make a crucial decision with regard to his route that could potentially change his life forever.</p>\n<p>You can catch the screenings of “She’s in Portland” on Jan. 16 at 5:20 p.m. in Metro 2 Theater downtown or on Jan. 20 at 4:20 p.m. in Fiesta 4 Theater during the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

We should value our time in 2020 and maximize it towards its fullest potential. We should spend time making our own lives feel balanced, prioritizing our needs as well as the needs of others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new year can also be looked at as an opportunity to be civically engaged by taking on work that affects the community in a positive way. Giving back strays from the typical New Year’s resolution that is geared directly towards personal growth, but it can still be an influencing factor in our futures. Getting involved in my student newspaper, helping educate elementary students about tree species and registering students to vote are all things I have been involved in this past year and have allowed me to contribute to my community as well as my sense of individuality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the new year often involves meeting new people, having new experiences and forming new social circles. While this seems exciting, one thing I have learned in 2019 is to not leave your old friends behind. We can often get swept up in new romances, friends and groups that make us forget we need to make an active effort to reconnect with people who have been there when we’ve needed them in the past. I’ve reconnected with people I hadn’t talked to in a long time over winter break and am subsequently happier because of it. So reach out to your childhood best friend, old neighbor or extended family. Ultimately, it could affect both your life and theirs for the better.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to popular belief, the new year does not necessarily need to be a period of change for everyone. Instead of thinking of the new year as a chance to kick a habit you’ll probably end up keeping, reexamine your daily routine and carve out more time for your own personal enjoyment and stability.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai thinks the new year is a good time for celebration, reflection and natural change rather than arbitrary resolutions. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

anthems, romanticism and calling out her haters. With the release of her last album “Reputation,” she has been dubbed a </span><a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/music/2019/8/21/20826837/ten-years-of-taylor-swift\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“pop princess” turned “snake.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However, her latest album “Lover” (already 2019’s </span><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8528285/taylor-swift-lover-us-biggest-sales-week-first-day\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best-selling album</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the US after one week) showcases the evolution of Swift’s music as she moves on from those who ruined her reputation to capture the bigger picture of love itself — in all of its glory, despair and hope. It returns to the lyrically unique roots of Taylor Swift’s early albums like “Red” but still keeps true to the pop sounds of “1989.” Perhaps more important is that “Lover” tackles not only love, but also topics of politics, sexism and individualism that vary from the typical subjects of her music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track and music video for “You Need To Calm Down” were released before the full album and received </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2019/06/21/how-taylor-swift-angered-everyone-you-need-calm-down/1512715001/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">criticism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from many who think her support of the LGBTQ+ community is a facade used to attract attention to her music. With the debut of “ME!” some fans were skeptical of “Lover” before it was even released because of the playful sounds that stray from her typically heartfelt and soulful music. However, the album proved to be much greater than the scope of these two singles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With “I Forgot That You Existed,” the album opens with a seemingly subtle nod to “Reputation” that shows that Swift has forgotten and grown to be indifferent to those who defamed her. The album then leads into more romantic songs reminiscent of early-era Swift with songs like “Cruel Summer” and “Paper Rings.” The namesake track of “Lover” can be easily declared as the most romantic song on the album, with a snare drum beating in the background that allows the song to seem like it could be picked out of any era of music and featuring wedding vow lyrics like “With every guitar string scar on my hand / I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

However, the sorrowful ballad the Swiftie fandom has seemed to gravitate toward the most is “Cornelia Street,” where Swift was renting an apartment when she met current boyfriend Joe Alwyn, showing her fear of losing someone she loves: “And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends / I’d never walk Cornelia Street again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swift also takes on sexism, a topic she has kept quiet on for quite some time, in “The Man.” This track contemplates how she would be treated in the media if she were male, even name-dropping Leonardo DiCaprio as an illustration of the careless attitude the media takes toward men who engage in many romantic relationships compared to women who do the same. While men may even be praised for their prowess, women are often spotlighted negatively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my favorites on the album, “Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince” is similarly one that takes on a political discussion, as Taylor </span><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWThgNheFWFyv?si=xieXaIl9QTehdYuihd_a4g\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shared in a Spotify message</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “This song is about disillusionment with our crazy world of politics and inequality, set in a metaphorical high school.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the inclusion of topics that press society today, Swift also includes a personal and raw song entitled “Soon You’ll Get Better” featuring the Dixie Chicks. This song is speculated to be about her </span><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/taylor-swift-mother-andreas-cancer-returned-61532553\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mother’s battle with cancer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the difficult emotions she experienced with the concluding lyrics: “Soon you’ll get better / cause you have to.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the album represents the whirlwind of emotions Swift has felt over the past few years in love, family and society but ends on a note of growth and newfound joy in “Daylight” where she references her old feelings from her album “Red”: “I once believed love was burning red / But it’s golden like daylight.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our day and age, it seems young adults are under a microscope when it comes to defining their future success. Businesses, universities and employers all share a vision that </span><a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2377-social-media-hiring.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not readily accept young members of society</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who are deemed to hold socially unacceptable views. This makes it hard for young adults, especially those who have a large social platform, to hide the evolution of their opinions and past mistakes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, several news stories seem to have arisen in relation to young people’s past mistakes — whether they are inappropriate comments, ideals or pictures. While adults are quick to jump to the conclusion that we teenagers are solely to blame for sharing these thoughts on our social media platforms in the first place, some of the blame seems to lie in the creation of social media itself — and its dangerous ability to make us feel overly comfortable sharing on what we falsely believe is a private medium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the creation of social media is not the only aspect to which blame can be attributed.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Kashuv has since apologized on his social media, </span><a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/6/18/parkland-student-rescinded-harvard-2023/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">informing Harvard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he has “grown” since the incident and that the comments were made “in private among equally immature high school students.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kashuv’s defensive attitude does demonstrate an important point that many adults in our society fail to recognize: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerging adults’ brains <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/neuroscience-of-20-somethings-brain-young-adults_n_1840495\">continue to develop well into their 20s</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Many members of our generation willingly recognize our mistakes and grow from them, but Kashuv misses the bigger picture in his apology: Racism is not something that can be simply brushed off as a mistake — it’s a form of serious bigotry. Kashuv’s claim that he has grown from comments made just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">years ago is not the best defense. His statement not only ignorantly assumes that most high school students hold the same “immature” views as he did, but it also unfairly equates immaturity to acts of discrimination. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, comparing the opinions and mindsets of my 17-year-old self to those of my 19-year-old self does not reveal much variation — I still hold the same values of acceptance, environmental advocacy, etcetera as I did before. Sure, I have </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">matured </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over the last two years, but I have maintained the same core values of human decency in recognizing that we’re all humans regardless of the color of our skin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where I think some young adults of our generation go wrong: They brush off problematic dispositions as easily forgivable because others around us shared the same opinions or because these comments were made in “private,” when we are all aware of the traceability of our social media footprint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance, it may seem like most young adults share the view that our past mistakes should not define our future chances at success, as we all have flaws. But this view should depend not only on the severity of our past mistakes but also on how we go about explaining them to the stakeholders who have the power to decide our futures. Kyle Kashuv failed in both of these areas. Harvard made the right move by standing its ground on rescinding Kashuv’s acceptance. It sends a message to all young adults to wake up and be conscious of the public display of their opinions and conveys that students with racist attitudes should not be accepted into universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is only prevalently displayed in our media today because Kashuv has such a wide platform, past mistakes can define any student. </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/18/what-leads-harvard-rescind-admission-racism-plagiarism-killing-your-mom/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.2eb09e2ca060\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard has dropped numerous students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> accused of sexual misconduct, those who have plagiarized and others who have made sexist and racist comments. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Harvard’s revealment of students’ true moral character is honorable, not all students who have exhibited these behaviors have been caught. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my time at UCSB, I’ve heard of students writing notes on their Scantrons prior to exams, seen students using Google on their phones at the end of exams and witnessed racist exchanges and unwanted sexual advances, among other behaviors.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the blame seems to lie in the creation of social media itself — and its dangerous ability to make us feel overly comfortable sharing on what we falsely believe is a private medium.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This brings up the issue of fairness. If students who have been caught cheating have had their admission revoked, what about the rest of the students who are admitted and cheat their whole way through college? Will future employers be able to see through these candidates in a short interview, or will they hire said candidates in the place of someone more deserving? This unfortunately seems like an issue that can only punish those who get caught and serve as a cautious warning to others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard’s policy on revoking admission also dangerously assumes that issues of plagiarism should be equated to much more serious issues of racism and sexual assault. Cheating on a quiz should not result in the same expulsory punishment as sexual harassment and discrimination. While cheating results in inhibiting one’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">own</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> personal success, harrassment and discrimination unequivocally affect </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">others</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in damaging ways. Therefore, it is not just up to us to hold ourselves accountable. It’s also the job of these institutions to mold a system that ensures fairness and a more in-depth evaluation of all students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kashuv’s mistake was a very specific incident that does not shed light on all the problems our generation is tasked with fixing. Recently, more women and female stars have been facing criticism for taking private photos which have leaked, negatively affecting their public image. This is most evident in the case of </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/21/18693604/bella-thorne-nude-photos-whoopi-goldberg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bella Thorne.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When hackers stole and threatened to release her nude photos, she released the photos herself before the blackmailers could. Whoopi Goldberg’s public disapproval of Thorne taking nude photos in the first place created a media storm when Goldberg said, “If you’re famous, I don’t care how old you are. You don’t take nude pictures of yourself.” While many agreed with Goldberg’s reaction, Thorne argued that Goldberg was unfairly shaming young women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Goldberg importantly points out the necessity of being aware of what follows us on our “cloud,” her comments shaming Thorne are problematic because they take the attention away from the bigger problem at hand: the objectification of women’s bodies and how they are consistently used against them. Women are encouraged to be more confident about their bodies — yet are shamed when they embrace them. In this and many other situations, women have been painted as the perpetrators of their own downfall, instead of the victims of these situations.

I remember in middle school breezing through Algebra I and geometry while most others had trouble. After every test was handed back in math, the first reaction from my friend would be, “What’d you make? I bet you got a 100.” The teacher would hand me the test back, my face would turn beat red and my heart would feel like it was about to explode out of my chest. Was it because I was afraid of personal disappointment, or was it because I was wary of not living up to my friend’s expectations? It was both.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anxiety\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic anxiety</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is defined as “an apprehensive uneasiness or nervousness, usually over an impending or anticipated ill,” particularly feeling distressed over academic tasks and school pressure. Coping with academic anxiety is a struggle that I’ve dealt with my whole life. It’s something I didn’t see the direct effects of when I was younger, but it gradually built up over time. At a young age, I was placed into the category of “academic talent.” My defining personality trait was decided for me before I could figure it out for myself: she’s the “smart one.” I remember being placed into the gifted student program in elementary school and being confused at what exactly it meant to be academically gifted. It didn’t help that my parents are engineers and that I’m half Indian — two facets which people attributed to my academic success as genetic.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87691\" style=\"width: 554px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87691\" data-attachment-id=\"87691\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-24/getting-as-and-taking-ls/academic-anxiety/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=650%2C464&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,464\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Academic anxiety\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=888%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87691\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?resize=544%2C388\" alt=\"\" width=\"544\" height=\"388\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alex Garcia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic anxiety is not something I’ve ever talked about with anyone or an aspect that anyone in my life has really noticed.

Whenever I would express nervousness or get back a grade that was not up to my standards my friends would laughingly tell me, “Oh shut up, you ace everything.” This aspect of “acing everything” wasn’t something that was an accomplishment for me anymore; it was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expected</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from my friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve tried to figure out what this anxiety boiling inside me stems from for a long time because my parents never pushed me toward perfection. They just wanted me to do my best. I’ve realized my anxiety originates from the notion that I want to emulate the success of people in my life, namely my parents, but also live up to this “smart” personality trait that has defined me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recognized that I can’t live up to this defining trait. We live in an increasingly bright generation of students who have pushed the boundaries of success toward something unattainable for most of us. It’s no longer ok to be “average.” Colleges, employers, our parents: They are all looking for some nuance of greatness in each one of us, which I was led to believe would be my exemplary academic success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, my extended family told me they had no doubt my grades alone would get me into any college I desired, something they didn’t realize many students had going for them. I live in a pool of intelligent students, a pond of intelligence which has grown quickly over time in which I discovered I am a very small fish. And I’m ok with that. It’s not the aspect of competition that is the root of my anxiety, but rather my attainment of individual success. I cried once in high school when I got a B on a test because I was so disappointed in myself. Yes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an actual B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I realized how stupid it was later that I cried over a B, but the anxiety associated with earning a B didn’t go away, just the initial extreme reaction.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stress associated with obtaining good grades in a college quarter system is exponential. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/02/03/stress-and-isolation-blamed-for-string-of-suicides-at-columbia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suicide rates at colleges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — especially Ivy League campuses from increasing academic pressure and schoolwork-related stress — indicates the pervasiveness of academic anxiety. These kids are portrayed as students who never left their dorm room or couldn’t cope with the pressure of going to such a competitive school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I feel academically challenged at UCSB, but the pressure of going to an Ivy League would be insurmountable for me. Being surrounded by geniuses and trying to define success for myself in that environment would cause me to reach a mental breaking point. I’ve heard stories about some Ivy League schools where if a student leaves their notes on a desk unattended, other students will trash them in an attempt to eliminate some competition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s not just Ivy League schools. I’ve seen my friends’ Snapchat stories where they’re stressed and staying up until 3 a.m. to finish that 30-page paper and got maybe four hours of sleep before their next class. And that’s when I realized that college isn’t just a struggle for me but an cumbersome fight for all of us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stress associated with obtaining good grades in a college quarter system is exponential. A 10-week course with a few major assignments making up the bulk of your grade is not exactly a framework that is conducive for students to succeed. We’re encouraged to take 15-17 units a quarter, which is a lot to juggle with sports, jobs, clubs and maintaining a social life. I didn’t realize the extremity of this until the end of Winter Quarter.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pride in getting A’s was small compared to the disappointment I would feel if I didn’t. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winter Quarter was a wake-up call for me. It was rainy, I was taking 17 units and it was the perfect condition for me to slack off. I have never felt as much anxiety as I did when I was sick during finals week. I felt as though I couldn’t breathe every time I finished one of my four finals — not just because my nasal passages were blocked, but also because I did the bare minimum to get by that quarter up until then. The intensity of cramming information into my brain was too much. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while I did get A’s in my classes Winter Quarter, I didn’t feel satisfied. Why? Because the expectation of succeeding was no longer external, it was something ingrained in me. The pride in getting As was small compared to the disappointment I would feel if I didn’t. I convinced myself if I didn’t get an A in one of my classes, I would be a colossal failure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Winter Quarter ended up being a wake-up call for my mental health. I know it isn’t reasonable to place these burdensome expectations on myself, but I still don’t know how to alleviate my academic anxiety; I don’t think any of us do. But I do know one thing: Academic success does not define us as students. We all have learning curves. While one of us may have an aptitude for calculus, someone else may have a knack for literature. We as a generation have a naive but admirable tendency to want to achieve greatness and make something of ourselves no matter the cost. After all, that’s what our parents did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But however you define success, you should never put it before your mental health. The anxiety caused by the desire to succeed is probably not going to be absent in our kids and future generations, but we should convince them that it’s more important to prioritize mental health than the anxiety of the burdens we’re facing.

The talent competition, contestant profile and numerous question and answer portions illustrate this very point. They now strive to be </span><a href=\"https://todayvenezuela.com/2019/01/06/the-miss-universe-pageant-is-more-diverse-than-ever/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more inclusive of all races</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the intent of the Miss Universe pageant being “a way to celebrate women and diversity.” Additionally, the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/17/miss-spain-becomes-first-transgender-woman-compete-miss-universe-pageant/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.731737227223\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first transgender contestant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> competed in the Miss Universe 2018 competition.

Miss America has responded to this enduring criticism by</span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miss-america-ending-swimsuit-competition_us_5b167608e4b093ac33a1d36e\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cutting the infamous swimsuit and evening gown competitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, instead aiming to focus on “honoring talent and scholarship.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My view of beauty pageants changed from skepticism to hope after competing in one myself and being positively impacted by the experience.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My view of beauty pageants changed from skepticism to hope after competing in one myself and being positively impacted by the experience. I was mostly piqued by curiosity and wanting to try something new, especially since it’s such a popular tradition in the South. There are many </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/literally-darling/trying-to-be-pretty-in-a-southern-beauty-pageant-town_b_7623954.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">societal expectations of women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> associated with the notion of “Southern hospitality” that pervade the South; high importance is placed on appearing charming, beautiful, and poised. This is a direct link to the traditional archetype of Southern beauty and femininity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, I did not fit the description of a stereotypical girl who would be interested in competing in beauty pageants. I was focused on my studies, my friends and my involvement in extracurriculars — not winning a beauty competition. My friend group, who were focused on similar things, surprisingly did not question my newfound curiosity. Some even showed up to watch and support me on the night of the pageant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first met girls in rehearsal who had been vying for the crown since they were toddlers, competing in numerous local and regional beauty contests to work their way up. I learned that the acquisition of one crown improved your pageant resume, in a sense, even if our high school competition was open to anyone in our school. Competing in our pageant also served as a valuable opportunity to practice poise, talent, etc. in preparation for later pageants. This, however, increased my skepticism upon entering the competition. Being the inexperienced outsider that I was, and lacking the shared intention to continue competing, I couldn’t help but feel somewhat excluded.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the supportive female community, I discovered that the most positive impact of pageantry was the newfound confidence it gave me. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite both my skepticism and my expectations that all my competitors would have elitist attitudes, I unexpectedly made multiple friends during the process. Rehearsal was grueling and started uncharacteristically early for a two-hour pageant. We would practice the opening number and our exits and entrances </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over and over again</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> until I was sure that the directors in charge were taking the event way too seriously. We would laugh after rehearsal at the ridiculousness of the dance moves we had to memorize and the “walks” we had to perfect before the final day, which made me feel at ease. Although these girls had more experience than I did, they didn’t have the snobby attitudes I expected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the morning of the pageant, the interview (which I didn’t prepare for) was the most telling part of the event. Every girl wore heels and bright dresses, with their makeup and hair already done. I didn’t have as much motivation to wake up early and get all of that done ahead of the 9 a.m. interview, and ended up dressing professionally with minimal makeup. Having done many academic and extracurricular interviews before, I believed I would nail it. However, the questions asked by the judges seemed almost </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> serious, like they were searching for the perfect answer. They asked questions like “how do you handle cliques at school?” with facial expressions that read, “I’m not looking for an answer about real personal experience, but one that’s been rehearsed.” Despite not doing as well as I’d expected, I still had hope for the merit of the pageant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a long day of preparation, the night of the pageant was still nerve-wracking, primarily because most of the girls were worried they would trip on stage or misspeak in front of the audience. When I used to watch the evening gown competition on TV, I imagined girls backstage gawking at each other, internally comparing who looked best in their dress. Instead, we all offered each other words of encouragement and praise before we individually took the stage. When the winners were announced at the end, we were happy for each other and grateful we got to develop friendships during the experience (I know, shocker!). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the supportive female community, I discovered that the most positive impact of pageantry was the newfound confidence it gave me. I didn’t realize until the end, when I found that I wasn’t as nervous onstage as I’d thought I’d be. It wasn’t that I wanted to look better than anyone, but that I felt confident in myself. But this wasn’t even the most rewarding aspect of participating. It was the moment when my mom came up to me afterwards with tears in her eyes, telling me how proud she was. To go on stage alone and walk in front of a crowd of people — many of whom attended my high school — with no prior experience as a beauty queen, was no easy feat. I didn’t care about what the judges or the audience thought of me, only about what I thought of myself, and I felt good.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai wants people to know the positive impacts beauty pageants can have on women.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86781\" style=\"width: 297px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86781\" data-attachment-id=\"86781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-09/argument-in-the-office-are-beauty-pageants-feminist-or-flawed/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=1792%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1792,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"beauty pageant kate ryan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=888%2C1015&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86781\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan-219x250.jpeg?resize=287%2C328\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=768%2C878&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=896%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 896w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?w=1792&amp;ssl=1 1792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kate Ryan / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Beauty Pageants: Only Skin Deep</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Emily Hickingbottom</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our current political and social climate, beauty pageants in the United States have become targets of widespread, controversial criticism. While competing in these competitions may seem innocent enough when girls are young, as years pass, competitions become increasingly focused on unrealistic physical beauty standards that can damage a girl’s self-image and confidence. Instead of teaching girls to strive for career focused and academic success, these competitions perpetuate the idea that “beauty” is a woman’s most important characteristic when determining her overall worth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though certain people (*</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cough cough*</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump) and recent events in the media might suggest otherwise, generally speaking, I’d like to think that we are living in a time where gender equality is the norm — particularly in the United States (though this isn’t always the reality). But, there is a startling disparity between the focus on male versus female sexuality in entertainment, specifically on television. There is a great deal of attention given to the Miss America Pageant and other pageants like it. These pageants champion a very specific “type” of woman, and, in doing so, they invalidate and demean the majority of other women who don’t meet these requirements. The ideal candidate is many things: She is tall, but not too tall; thin, but not too thin; curvy, but in only the “right” places. Always smiling, always put together, always on cue. Women’s beauty and self-worth extend far beyond these superficial standards of attractiveness. Qualities involving attraction and beauty are not measured by the size of a woman’s waist or by the symmetry of her face. These measurements are shallow and speak volumes when evaluating what the Miss America competition and similar pageants represent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By allowing pageants to determine beauty or value based almost entirely on surface level characteristics, we are projecting harmful images about a woman’s “place” and purporting normative expectations of appearance, thus slowing our advancement into a more progressive society. With ever-changing definitions of femininity and beauty developing in America, competitions like Miss America, and the narrow beauty ideals they promote, are becoming increasingly outdated and are in dire need of greater scrutiny.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These pageants champion a very specific “type” of woman, and, in doing so, they invalidate and demean the majority of other women who don’t meet these requirements.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The danger of beauty pageants is evidenced in the name itself. They evaluate participants based solely upon physical “beauty” and reduce these women’s unique and individually remarkable features to nothing more than a series of numbers on a scale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some might disagree because of the question and answer portions included in some beauty pageants. While I grant that this gives the contestant an opportunity to showcase themselves outside the physical realm, there exists a long-standing expectation of fumbling failure amid this segment of the competition, held by viewers and judges alike. Contestants are called to answer what is typically a controversial, multifaceted question, who are then expected to respond eloquently, despite the pressure and lack of preparation for the question. It almost seems as if judges are waiting for contestants to fail, especially considering the judges’ and media’s reactions to incidents like </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miss-utah-usa-2013-fumbles-question_n_3451918\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miss Utah’s fumbled answers </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during her run for Miss USA in 2012.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building further on this point, we must also consider the corporate sponsorships and owners of these supposedly harmless, good-natured competitions. Of course, these large corporations would not want to promote an idea of beauty which gives women — particularly female viewers of the pageant — the idea that intellect and personal values are more important than living up to a rigid set of impossible beauty standards. If us women collectively came to that conclusion, we might not buy as much makeup, or shop as often or regularly allow men to determine our worth. We might argue more to receive equal pay or, worse yet, start speaking up for ourselves in situations where we don’t believe our interests are being equally represented. This is not to say that all businesses and corporations have these intentions, but when we stop to consider who is at the head of some of the major national pageants, it becomes apparent that their respective owners do not actively endorse gender equality, or even respect women, for that matter.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continued occurrence of these toxic competitions only serves to convince men and women alike that physical beauty is an acceptable measurement of a woman’s worth</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, who owns them? Who has vested interests in the pageant’s success? In the case of Miss America, the owner and individual responsible for their continued success in 2015 was none other than </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/miss-usa-2018-miss-america-tries-rebrand-trump-s-former-ncna876246\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donald Trump.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think it’s safe to say that, given our current political climate and Donald Trump’s infamy in the United States, we are fully aware that his version of respecting women is far from acceptable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, I imagine watching my future daughter up on stage, competing in a Miss California or Miss USA pageant and, immediately, I am overcome with anger. In a time when gender equality and sexual freedom are at a peak in our current society, I would hope that women don’t need validation from a select group of biased judges with predisposed preferences for a narrow set of characteristics, predetermined by heterosexual, white, male owners and sponsors of the competitions. I think the idea that beauty can be defined by physical characteristics is, in and of itself, a toxic concept. If we could define beauty by a specific set of physical characteristics, then we could, theoretically, define what characteristics make an individual unattractive as well. When considering things from the reverse perspective, the thought that we can identify beauty purely based on appearance seems absolutely absurd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continued occurrence of these toxic competitions only serves to convince men and women alike that physical beauty is an acceptable measurement of a woman’s worth. Generations of young women, including the young women on this campus, are presently growing up in the shadow of a misogynistic president and his anti-feminist ideals. And unfortunately, despite my belief that pageantry might have the capability to change into a valuable experience for young women under the right leadership and reform, the overwhelmingly powerful presence of men like Trump in this arena makes it extremely difficult to separate the positives from the negatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are all beautiful, each of us in our own unique ways, both physically and mentally. No two people are the same and no two people perceive beauty in the same way. So trust me when I tell you, regardless of what pageant judges or Trump might say, every single one of you is gorgeous. Your worth and beauty extends far beyond what any competition can possibly attempt to decide. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Hickingbottom wants women to know that their beauty runs much deeper than the surface. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

Mimi commended Roger Durling, the executive director of the film festival, for keeping the festival local in regards to putting a spotlight on Santa Barbara films, even though the event is traditionally global in scope.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film is a documentary about Mike deGruy, a biologist and filmmaker who filmed in oceans around the world, capturing images of unique sea creatures.

All praised each other’s films profusely and when asked to identify other noteworthy films of the year, three of the five directors selected films directed by women. A notable response from Cuarón about his filmmaking process was that he “had to have less control in the process in order to give him more creative freedom.” Roger Durling closed by presenting the five directors with their awards, noting the cinematic talent and diversity in the group.</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 3: Feb. 1</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day three was one of the most anticipated tribute nights of the whole festival, with Rami Malek receiving the Outstanding Performer of the Year award for his performance as Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had the chance to speak with Malek, who arrived at the red carpet with presenter and co-star Joe Mazzello and co-star Lucy Boynton:</span></p>\n<p><b>Q: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you have any background on Queen before acting in “Bohemian Rhapsody”?</span></p>\n<p><b>A: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not like I do now, no. I think everyone in this cast feels like they could write their own biography about the band. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, it was just hearing the music and feeling the same passion behind it that we all feel when we hear a Queen song. I think it touches everyone in their own unique ways, but it galvanizes us. It’s a story that I wanted to be a part of telling.</span></p>\n<p><b>Q: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a certain amount of pressure with playing such a legend in a biographical film. Did you feel any of this pressure while acting?</span></p>\n<p><b>A: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, an immense amount of pressure.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just thought that if I had the right resources and enough time, that there would be a chance that I could pull it off. I think when we get to be the face of these films — the image that people see — but for myself, it’s a combination of so many different forces that have allowed me to stand here and say, ‘I got to portray Freddie Mercury and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">possibly </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pull it off,’ and that is due to the work of everyone on set. It’s everyone coming together and creating that performance that allows me to represent a film and not just myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malek was then interviewed by Feinberg about his career and background; Malek spoke about how his early gigs placed him into a category of “Egyptian roles” because of his ethnicity and about his initial struggle to make his mark in the industry. Malek also talked about his preparation for his role as Freddie Mercury, in which he detailed his admiration towards Queen and Freddie’s passion and comfort on the stage.</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 4: Feb. 2</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viggo Mortensen was honored with the American Riviera Award for his performance in “Green Book</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mortensen was interviewed by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deadline</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> awards columnist Pete Hammond, reflecting upon his acting career. Mortensen said he decided to become an actor at the “relatively late age” of 21 but started educating himself on film by visiting revival movie houses, where he became inspired by “spellbinding performances.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also stated that he was lucky to land so many minor roles early in his career because it allowed him to practice the craft of acting. He cites the “Lord of the Rings” franchise as opening the door for him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mortensen closed by remarking that the best result of “Green Book”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is that it has helped people discover the music of classical and jazz pianist and composer Don Shirley. At the end of the night, Mortensen’s longtime friend Ed Harris presented the actor with the award. </span></p>\n<p><b>Day 5: Feb. 3</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glenn Close was first presented with the Maltin Modern Master Award for her performance in “The Wife.” Close discussed “The Wife” in an interview with film critic Leonard Maltin. Close stated that it took 14 years to get the money to make the film, but that it had an interesting script unlike any other project she’d done before. She also went on to discuss her performance in other films like “Fatal Attraction” and “Cruella de Vil.” Close was humbled when she accepted the award, saying she is “blessed to be able to do the thing I love most in the world.” Close’s dog, Pip, also made numerous appearances onstage during the tribute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that evening, a sold-out crowd attended the Montecito Award tribute, given to Melissa McCarthy for “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” In a conversation with IndieWire Editor Anne Thompson, McCarthy discussed her early work in “Gilmore Girls,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reminiscing upon her first job which lasted for seven years. She went on to discuss “Bridesmaids,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Hangover” and her love for producing with “building a project from the beginning up.” McCarthy’s co-star Richard E. Grant presented her with the award and McCarthy thanked the SBIFF for “shining a light on these types of movies.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 6: Feb. 4</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On day six, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Variety</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> presented the Variety Artisans Awards at the Lobero Theatre to those “essential to the filmmaking process who have exhibited the most innovative work of the year in their respective fields.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The award was presented to 12 Oscar nominees, including “Black Panther” costume designer Ruth Carter and “Mary Poppins” composer Marc Shaiman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full list of honorees is below:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barry Alexander Brown (“BlakKklansman”), Ruth E.

Each honoree engaged in a one-on-one discussion with interviewer Dave Karger, followed by participation in a panel discussion. Each actor discussed their acting experience and how they learned to channel emotions and realize the scope of their role to truly succeed in their respective films. Following the panel discussion, actor Christopher Lloyd presented the awards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The honorees included:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yalitza Aparicio (“Roma”), Sam Elliott (“A Star is Born”), Elsie Fisher (“Eighth Grade”), Claire Foy (“First Man”), Richard E. Grant (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?”), Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie (“Leave No Trace”), John David Washington (“BlacKkKlansman”) and Steven Yeun (“Burning”). </span></p>\n<p><b>Day 8: Feb. 7</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day eight was by far the most media-heavy and fan-filled night with the last tribute award: the Cinema Vanguard Award honoring Michael B. Jordan for his work in “Black Panther”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and “Creed II.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan was greeted by a mob of excited fans, followed by a brief red carpet appearance before his interview with Feinberg. Jordan discussed working on a soap opera, his big move to Los Angeles, his preference towards non-stereotypical roles and ended on the significance of “Black Panther”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as a cultural phenomenon that he called their “Star Wars</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actor Jamie Foxx made a surprise appearance to present Jordan with the award. “I’m not in this for fame. I’m not in this for the attention. I’m really trying to create a blueprint to show people that if you’re good, and you’re good-hearted, and you do the right thing, that you can be successful,” Jordan said after accepting the honor. </span></p>\n<p><b>Day 9: Feb. 9</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last night of the festival featured the world premiere of “Spoons: A Santa Barbara Story” by director Wyatt Daily. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Spoons” details California’s surfing history and how Santa Barbara produced, and continues to produce, some of the most world-class surfers and innovators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara Film Festival brought tourism, fame and inspiring words from the finest directors, actors, and creators that made fans and the press alike feel like they were a part of the glamorous and powerful Hollywood scene.</span></p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_86370\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"295633181\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86369\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86370\" data-attachment-id=\"86370\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/michael-b-jordan-highlights-years-sbiff/sbiff_jenny-luo_online-10-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1457&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1457\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF_Jenny Luo_ONLINE-10\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg?fit=250%2C182&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg?fit=888%2C647&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86370\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg?resize=888%2C647\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"647\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg?resize=250%2C182&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg?resize=768%2C559&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C746&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SBIFF_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-10-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86370\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.
