He was a perfect fit for the 2018 A.S. Program Board Welcome Back Concert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco’s demeanor was open and welcoming as he bounced up and down on stage with his crew. Opening act Mu$ty BoYz kicked off the event with a DJ set. In recent months, Cuco has been on tour around the U.S. but has a fan base spanning well outside the states to Mexico, South America, Europe and Asia, to name a few.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84209\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"905144388\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84208\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84209\" data-attachment-id=\"84209\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/marcos-reynoso_cuco_online-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?fit=2000%2C1261&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1261\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Marcos Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?fit=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?fit=888%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-84209\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5-1024x646.jpg?resize=888%2C560\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C646&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=768%2C484&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-84209\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marcos Reynoso / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We haven’t slept in 13 hours,” Cuco said. “We played a show in Illinois last night.

Cuco started out by uploading his Spanish melodies to Bandcamp in 2015. His popularity soared with the release of his 2017 single “Lo Que Siento,” a track in which he discusses dreaming of love when he’s alone. His lyrics are seamless — even though alternating lines can be in different languages, English or Spanish, the song still flows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to many students of the UCSB population, Cuco grew up in southwest L.A. county as a first-generation Mexican-Americanand can relate to many Dreamers here on campus. The artist is leading by example and through his music, exemplifying that being a Dreamer can make you stronger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco also identifies with and advocates for members of the LGBTQ+ community. “But what I think is cool also is that I see more artists of color not just coming from Mexican descent but different orientations with their sexuality and gender identity,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a recent interview with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pigeons &amp; Planes, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he shared his humble start as a young independent artist: “I never had connections at any point to the industry. Like, my life was like literally going to school, watching my mom clean houses, my dad driving limos and every other weekend having a guitar … This is raw, this is me,” the artist said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco is not motivated by money or “making it big” with a record label; he’s doing music because that’s what he’s always wanted to do.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84210\" style=\"width: 666px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"899396935\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84208\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84210\" data-attachment-id=\"84210\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/marcos-reynoso_cuco_online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=1281%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1281,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Marcos Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=656%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-84210\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3-656x1024.jpg?resize=656%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"656\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=656%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 656w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1199&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1281&amp;ssl=1 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-84210\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marcos Reynoso / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is Cuco following his creative aspirations, but he’s also helping his parents along the way: “Growing up, any first-generation child’s dream is literally always, ‘I want to help my parents out. I need to get my parents out of working. I want to pay my parents’ mortgage off. I want to get my parents out,’ and that’s hopefully what I’m going to do.” He’s making his parents proud not only through his music or success but also through his motivation to bring them up with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fusing traditional Latinx music with contemporary indie, Cuco is bridging the gap between the two genres and, in turn, creating his own musical niche. His eclectic sound is not like anything on the charts now. He took a risk keeping close to his roots, and it paid off. His sound melds old influence with his own beats, creating his personalized flare. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many in the audience connected to his music, even though he is still slightly hesitant to fully embrace his craft. “I don’t know if y’all are going to vibe with my music, but sing this shit with me, alright?” Cuco asked as the audience erupted with cheers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being approached by record labels, Cuco has resisted, standing strong as an independent artist. Even though many refer to his music as “dream” or “bedroom pop,” Cuco’s music cannot be fully defined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco has broken barriers not only with his music but also with his messages of tolerance, acceptance and self-love. “I feel like people hate that I’m a guy and I’m making this, like, super soft music,” he once explained, “so I like seeing really big white buff dudes looking all pissed at me because I’m on stage being successful and brown.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/","id":6630,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6629,6628,6627],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Grammys Pay Tribute to Past and Present","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=900%2C506&ssl=1","description":"No matter how small an artist starts, they can reach the height of their craft.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The 2017 Grammy Awards were a glimpse back at legends lost and a look forward to the young artists ready to dominate the music scene in years to come.</p>\n<p>Bruno Mars played Prince’s twin, paying tribute to the king of funk.

Vulnerable, she stopped short after opening with “Fastlove” in her tribute to the esteemed pop icon. She asked to “restart” the song from the top saying, “I can’t mess this up for him.” She shares an emotional connection to Michael because of their mutual London roots. It was quite a night for the pop songstress herself. The powerhouse singer simply dominated, bringing home five Grammys for her third studio album, 25, in the show’s most sought-after categories: Song, Record and Album of the Year. The British songstress performed “Hello” in a geometric red and black dress with an accordion skirt, channeling her classic look with a new twist.  The nostalgia in the room was uncanny, with the singer gushing, “The last time I was here was five years ago, and I was pregnant … I lost a lot of myself being a mother … it seems like I’ve gone full circle.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Throughout her five wins, Adele decided to share her successes with an idol of hers, Beyoncé.</p>\n<p>“I adore you, and I want you to be my mommy,” she exclaimed to Queen Bey. “The Lemonade album was so monumental … We got to see another side of you … We, as artists, adore you … You are our light.” Beyoncé stopped the show with her breathtaking performance centered around her latest studio album, Lemonade. Although she chose to perform less popular tracks, including “Love Drought,” and “Sandcastles,” she successfully won over the crowd. Even while pregnant with twins, she still owned it. Bey’s royalty radiated through her goddess-like costume.</p>\n<p>The messages she instilled in us will stay: “Your mother is a woman, and women like her cannot be contained.” Queen Bey’s performance will go down in Grammys history.</p>\n<p>Although there was no specific tribute dedicated to David Bowie, he won Best Rock Song with “Blackstar,” the title track from his 25th and final studio album, which was released on his 69th birthday.</p>\n<p>Best New Artist recipient Chance the Rapper also took the night by storm.</p>\n<p>“I claim this victory in the name of the Lord,” he exclaimed. “I know that people think independence means you do things by yourself, but independence means freedom.”</p>\n<p>He referenced SoundCloud and “all the independent artists out there” throughout his speech and encouraged the audience to continue in their endeavors, big or small. Chance started as an independent artist himself with his first mixtape, 10 Day, and since then, he has made significant strides in the music world, winning his first Grammy with Coloring Book. His success shows that no matter how small an artist starts, they can reach the height of their craft.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75760\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"859788678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75756\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75760\" data-attachment-id=\"75760\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,506\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=888%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75760\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85-250x141.jpg?resize=250%2C141\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75760\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of NPR</p></div>\n<p>After taking a break from the public since her father’s death in 2009, Paris Jackson finally made an appearance, presenting The Weeknd and Daft Punk. The trio began with a medley of “Starboy” that led into “I Feel It Coming.” The collaboration gave rise to an unusual yet intriguing set that channeled Hoth from “Star Wars.”</p>\n<p>New York DJ duo Drew Taggart and Alex Pall, also known as the Chainsmokers, rocked the charts this past year. Tracks such as “Don’t Let Me Down,” “Closer” and “Roses” blasted through speakers on repeat, whether at a raging party, the gym or car radios. It’s no wonder that they won their first ever Grammy Award this year alongside Daya. Although Rihanna turned them down to be featured in the Grammy winning single, “Don’t Let Me Down,” they still seemed to reach success in the viral department.</p>\n<p>Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun of Twenty One Pilots were definitely not “stressed out” about receiving their award for “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” in nothing but their underpants.</p>\n<p>“Josh turned to me … and he said, ‘If we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this,’” Joseph said.</p>\n<p>Ed Sheeran was loving our bodies, and we are loving his Grammy performance right back. Although he was a last-minute addition to the set list, he did not disappoint. Sheeran centered his performance around his latest single, “Shape of You.” He decided to play it casual and performed the song with nothing more than his acoustic guitar. His manner seemed like he was performing for a few of his closest friends, yet millions were watching all over the world. His all-black outfit — including a “HOAX” T-shirt, black jeans and kicks — contributed to the affinity of his performance.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native Katy Perry took the stage with a new and improved look. With short blonde locks that frame her face and a new wardrobe, she surprised the audience as platinum Perry. She really was trapped in her “white picket fence” as she took the stage on a set emulating her opening line to her new hit single, “Chained To The Rhythm.” Perry came barreling out in a white, black-lined pantsuit and John Lennon-esque rose-colored glasses and white sneakers. She walked through blue and white clouds and turned the corner to find Skip Marley, grandson of Jamaican legend Bob Marley. The younger Marley channeled his grandfather’s eclectic reggae sound and wore a white army jacket and pants. Perry topped her performance off with an iconic “We the People” backdrop.</p>\n<p>In a night with no shortage of political statements, Donald Trump was criticized by a number of performers. Neil Portnow, record producer and president of the Recording Academy, took a different approach, calling out to Washington to keep American music alive.</p>\n<p>After quoting John F. Kennedy, he remarked, “The Recording Academy together with the music-makers call on the President and Congress to help keep the music playing by updating music laws, protecting music education and renewing America’s commitment to the arts.” Portnow concluded, “We have a collective responsibility to preserve what binds us and to ensure that the whole world continues to benefit from one of our most unique,  economically and spiritually important assets and exports: American music.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/","id":6710,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6709,6708,6707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Atomics Are a Blast from the Past","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.44.59-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.44.59-PM.png?resize=948%2C362&ssl=1","description":"Not only are these siblings taking the music industry by storm, but also the modeling world.

Some would say the Smiths are “genetically blessed” or “musically talented”—close to having it all. I’ll say they’re definitely something else. With a mere entrance they seem like they’re from the 70s, which may stem from their early upbringing and roots in Spanish Fork, Utah, a small town one hour south of Salt Lake City.</p>\n<p>“We got instruments for Christmas when we were younger. When we first started, we lived in Utah, so we just set up all our instruments in the family room. We’ve been playing since then, but it was probably seven or eight years ago when we said, ‘Let’s form a band and play shows.’ We had our name, ‘The Atomics,’ and that was it.

It’s kind of like I have four moms, but they’re fun moms.” The intimacy of Velvet Jones made it seem like the audience was watching the Smiths’ performance as their relatives at a family event–the performance could have been in their living room, kitchen or backyard.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76000\" style=\"width: 198px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheAtomics-AndrewMacpherson-XIXPR01.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1303372280\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75421\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76000\" data-attachment-id=\"76000\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/theatomics-andrewmacpherson-xixpr01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheAtomics-AndrewMacpherson-XIXPR01.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TheAtomics-AndrewMacpherson-XIXPR#01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheAtomics-AndrewMacpherson-XIXPR01.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheAtomics-AndrewMacpherson-XIXPR01.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheAtomics-AndrewMacpherson-XIXPR01-188x250.jpg?resize=188%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"188\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheAtomics-AndrewMacpherson-XIXPR01.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheAtomics-AndrewMacpherson-XIXPR01.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheAtomics-AndrewMacpherson-XIXPR01.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The Atomics</p></div>\n<p>The Atomics opened up with their song, “If I Hit You in the Head,” a classic rock’n’roll-influenced surf jam. Pyper impressed the audience with her dance moves, iconically falling to the ground with her guitar. The song, “Cuz You’re in Love,” was featured in a recent H&amp;M campaign video. It’s slow sound and wave-like beat transformed the audience from jumping up and down to a nonchalant sway. The Smiths closed their set with their latest song, “Voulez Vous,” which was released in October and is available for listening on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>Not only are these siblings taking the music industry by storm, but also the modeling world. All four are signed with Next Models, Los Angeles. Pyper discussed balancing music with modeling, “Well, I can’t choose between the two because they’re so different, even though they’re both in the entertainment industry. Like with music I’m a bit more free, I play what I want and dress how I want,” she said. “With modeling, everyone’s doing what they want to me and I’m trying to create an image for them. Scheduling wise it’s good because modeling is during the day. There’s set times and our photo shoots are usually in the morning, so I can always do music at night. It’s fun to do both.”</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Voulez Vous by THE ATOMICS\" width=\"888\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F286907145&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=888&amp;maxheight=1000&amp;dnt=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The amazing thing about this family band is how eclectic and original their sound is, yet it’s retro psychedelic. “When we first started playing together we played surf music, so we did a lot of Ventures covers,” Daisy added. “Our influences differ a lot depending on which band member you’re talking to. Like I play guitar, so I love like Dick Dale and Chuck Berry. Lucky loves old school hip-hop beats, while Pyper loves disco music and Starlie loves jazz and soulful singers.”</p>\n<p>With so much to juggle as band mates, modeling partners and siblings, the Smiths’ still get the job done. They’ve successfully assimilated into the Californian rock’n’roll lifestyle, all while walking runways such as Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Bottega Veneta, Fendi and Tom Ford.</p>\n<p>“In the next year we’ll be playing Coachella. We’re going to be in Europe doing shows, so I think it’s going to be a lot of traveling, which is always fun with my siblings,” Pyper said, reflecting on what’s to come in the next few months. “I hope that we can develop our music more because a lot of our songs are different. I hope that we can focus in on a sound we all really love and become tighter as a band.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75421\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75421\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/","id":6704,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6703,6702,6701],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/694"}},"__N_SSG":true}
