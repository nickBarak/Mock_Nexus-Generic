For Morrison, the biggest losses were the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-22/university-sheriffs-office-discourage-deltopia-celebrations-in-light-of-coronavirus-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now-postponed Warm-Up</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Extravaganza concerts held annually during spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the Program Board knew these concerts couldn’t be facilitated during spring quarter, they looked for imaginative solutions, according to Morrison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, we have to really focus that our base mission is providing entertainment for students, and we can think creatively about how we can do that,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make up for spring quarter shows and events that had been pushed back or cancelled, Morrison said ASPB decided to invite high-profile speakers for Zoom events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process proved to be hectic, Morrison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We kind of just got thrown into this and started having to plan events really fast, versus [having] the previous quarter to plan these events,” Morrison said. “We were planning these events as they were happening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite having to move quickly, securing the talent was relatively straightforward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are all speakers that I would say that we couldn’t probably bring during the normal year,” Morrison said. But the virtual nature of the events sometimes made convincing the guests simpler — the usual costs and hassles associated with traveling, staffing and paying for a venue would not be necessary, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And because </span><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/features/hollywood-coronavirus-entertainment-industry-unemployment-jobs-1234592106/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">performers in a frozen entertainment industry</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> no longer have the assurance of steady pay, they have become more flexible with their schedules, according to Morrison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Their whole livelihood was basically doing events, so I think that now they’re honestly looking for these types of gigs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to Zoom, however, was not not completely smooth. For the first few gatherings, Morrison recounted one instance of Zoombombing and difficulties ensuring that event attendees were not from outside of UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the small issues aside, I think it’s been great and I think that people have really come together and worked hard to make these events flow,” Morrison said, adding that all ASPB members have begun to moderate events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison pointed to the Binging with Babish event as one instance of success this quarter, where the titular YouTube personality offered viewers a behind-the-scenes tour of his filming locations — a clandestine opportunity that students wouldn’t have received had the show taken place in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was our first time doing a big virtual event with an outside talent using this new webinar platform,” Morrison said. “And everyone was just so nice and wonderful and wholesome. It was really sweet.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that first event, the ASPB has hosted events ranging from a talk with comedian Eric Andre to a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/lil-paint-y-with-lil-yachty/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">night of painting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with rapper Lil Yachty, complete with a question-and-answer session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When UCSB eventually transitions back to on-campus instruction, the ASPB will likely dial back the frequency of high-profile visits, Morrison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s wanting to use students’ fees in the best way possible,” she said. “It would be harder to bring in the talent that we are bringing — we’re able to do this because of this kind of new situation and because the costs of it are a lot different.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when UCSB switches back to on-campus learning, Morrison said that the ASPB won’t forget the difficulties they overcame.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing I think [the pandemic] taught us: to be really appreciative of this opportunity that we have on board to book events for students,” Morrison said. “I don’t think we realized until it was gone just how much we love doing this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But how you can deal with setbacks like this, issues like this — if you can figure out a way through it, you can make great things happen,” she added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Six applicants will then be selected after applications close on June 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lisa Klock, the process innovation program manager of the College of Letters &amp; Science Information Technology (I.T.) department, explained that a visit to Westmont College in Santa Barbara served as a major catalyst for the internships. In observing Westmont I.T. interns, she noted that “it [was] extraordinary what the students are capable of” as they worked alongside faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klock stressed that UCSB’s internships are open to anyone “who’s really wanting this” and that they’re “not just looking for the coder.” All majors, she said — including humanities and social sciences majors — who demonstrate creativity, motivation and “a desire to learn something new” are welcome to apply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Explore, dream and discover,” Klock summarized. “Coding can be taught.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although interns will be positioned in different departments and will be working with different sets of software, Klock said that students will still meet regularly to share their progress, talk about their experiences and present their work to administrators. The objective is to foster a sense of camaraderie among all six interns and prepare them for the “real world,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chief among the program’s considerations, Klock said, is to increase student involvement on campus and to “keep these students working for the UC and inside the UC family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We only have what is known as ‘one deep’ structures in many of our IT operations,” Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for I.T. and chief information officer of UCSB, said in an email. “If a person leaves, it leaves a skills and capabilities gap.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution is to “immerse students in I.T. culture,” Klock said. That involves having undergraduates with full administrative privileges directly creating and editing the school’s digital infrastructure, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a win-win,” Hall said. “Employers benefit by lowering the burden of on-boarding well-qualified candidates. And the interns are equipped with practical skill in a high demand field.” Another benefit, he said, would come in the form of “a potential pool of future employees” for the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, the coronavirus put a wrench in the internship plans, but staff members adapted the internship training in order to keep them on pace with the original schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemic struck the same month we sent out the application,” Rebecca Carroll, the technical project manager at Enterprise Technology Services, said.

But international students, who compose 14% of the campus population, face the possibility that if they leave the country, they won’t be able to return.<em> Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if she could go back home, there was the looming possibility that she would either contract the virus while there or be denied reentry into the United States, and thus be unable to return to UCSB, she explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fall Quarter 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there are 3,261 international undergraduate students attending UCSB — composing 14% of the campus population — as well as 914 international graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these international students are in the same situation as Xu — unable to return to their home countries, but unable to remain in the dorms without paying the $300 spring break housing fee. UCSB’s Global Gaucho Commission (GGC), a student organization that advocates for the interests of international students on campus, is working to alleviate that financial burden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charles K. Neumann, a fourth-year global studies and political science double major and co-founder and internal chair of GGC, explained that the organization made it a priority to push for housing vouchers for all students whose travel plans had been altered by the coronavirus, beginning in February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a survey conducted by the GGC of 100 Chinese students currently living in residence halls on campus, more than half of the respondents planned to either return to China or remain at a friend’s house or a hotel during spring break, Neumann said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But those results were from Week 6 of winter quarter, he noted, and “there are definitely students who are still having difficulty [with] finding places.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternative housing options that are currently available at UCSB are limited; students needing temporary housing must apply through the </span><a href=\"http://food.ucsb.edu/resources/housing/emergency-transitional-housing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Crisis Response Team</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (FCRT), which approves each housing request one at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want is a more universal kind of deal where all students who are affected by the coronavirus [are] being given housing vouchers,” Neumann said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But according to Neumann, the process of advocating for spring break housing vouchers for any students, international or otherwise, is not an easy process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two weeks of continuous back and forth with the administration — including a trip to Cheadle Hall to speak with an absent Chancellor Henry T. Yang, multiple attempts at talking to the Division of Student Affairs and a petition — the GGC was eventually directed to Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE), according to Neumann.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been copying from one contact source to another,” Neumann said. “And initially, we kind of felt like they were just passing us along, to kind of shift responsibility to somebody else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 21, HDAE sent an email to students living in university-owned housing to offer them the opportunity to stay in their current dorm during spring break given “an extenuating circumstance due to the travel restrictions as a result of the coronavirus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, students who opt for this extra week of housing must still pay the fee. Neumann argued that since the cost originates from “a circumstance that is completely beyond anybody’s control,” the GGC still plans to meet with Garry Mac Pherson, the vice chancellor for administrative services, to discuss waiving the fee entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GGC is exploring alternative payment avenues in the event that UCSB does not waive the housing fee, Peter Feng, a second-year economics major and external chair of the GGC, said. According to Feng and Neumann, potential options include reimbursements after spring break from either the organization or A.S., a food-specific waiver for eating out in local establishments when the dining commons are closed during break and housing waivers from the FCRT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the one thing that the administration cannot provide, Xu said, is certainty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If [courses become] online, we are kind of worried whether we should go back to China or just stay here,” Xu said. At the time, UCSB had only announced that classes would take place remotely </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">through the end of April</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rather than through the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entire spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “We’ll just wait and see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a growing concern … of international students not being able to go home and not being able to reenter the United States,” Neumann said, which could force international students to stay in the U.S. during the summer and possibly prevent new international students from entering the country in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“International students are being overlooked in terms of resources and just care, compared to domestic students,” Neumann said. “Even now, international students are still receiving inadequate support from the university administration compared to what they deserve.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever the following days, weeks and months have in store, Xu expressed that this situation was not ideal for anyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all hope we can get over with this, right?” she said. “I hope everything could get back to normal as soon as possible.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They had a garage,” Gerstenberger said. “And the second that I had space was, ‘let’s go buy a piece of equipment and make it happen.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Gertsenberger also touched on his eagerness to begin screen-printing, which he said he was drawn to from the beginning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea that I could actually see the process of creating a stencil on a mesh with ink and a squeegee and create a final product is, I think, really fascinating.” Ultimately, he said, he “just wanted to have a print shop in a garage just so [he] could make [his] own t-shirts.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, Gerstenberger built his passion project into a small business, starting with $7,000 in investments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “$7,000 is a lot in some mindsets,” he said. But, assuming one order of t-shirts was worth $500, “I could do … 10 jobs or 20 jobs in two years and make my money back.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But soon enough, he had far more than 20 jobs coming his way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gerstenberger recalled working 40 to 50 hours a week at the beginning, which, according to his calculations, was often far less than minimum wage. But the business kept growing, necessitating five moves across Goleta and Santa Barbara in search of bigger spaces to keep up with demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At times, I hoped that there was an electrical fire that happened where we could just be like, ‘bummer, it all burned down and we got to move on,’” he joked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as the company grew, something had to give; in this case, it was Gerstenberger’s economics major, which he dropped.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s ironic, because I walked into the econ department saying I’m gonna start a small business … ‘Do you guys have any suggestions?’” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The department advised that he “apply the theories” that he learned in his classes. Later, when Gerstenberger returned at wits’ end to ask if he could use his business as the basis of a research project, which would have allowed him to reduce his course load, they turned him down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[They were] like, ‘sorry, we can’t do anything,’” Gerstenberger said. “‘We can’t do independent study,’ like, ‘this is the way it is.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these hardships, Gerstenberger said he lives for what he does.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve learned to realize that the people around me are the most valuable thing I have,” he said, listing customers that range from  PTA moms, to “a random group of people from elementary school” to “a small business here to a medium-sized business there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone needs t-shirts,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular relationship that stuck with Gerstenberger is Jose Cardoso, a fellow screen printer with over 25 years of experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We met when I was in the garage and I didn’t have the experience that I needed to do everything,” Gerstenberger said. “And so I’d send him jobs that I couldn’t do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gerstenberger, the pair quickly settled into their own roles: he the “designer and sales,” and Cardoso the “master printer.” After a year of working together, they decided to join forces for good.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Trust in other people and … let other people do the things that aren’t your strengths,” Gerstenberger said. “Divide and conquer was something that was important for us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Gerstenberger said he is looking to expand operations to universities beyond UCSB and to parts of northern California. More recently, in 2018, Island View Outfitters moved their print shop to Cuyama, a town two hours away from I.V. with “a market, a gas station and a hotel,” and little else, but with cheaper manufacturing costs and the ability to ship to anywhere in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The future is never certain, and the difficulty with a small business is we don’t have that control,” he added. “On the other side though, it’s not a matter about what the future is. It’s a matter about today, it’s a matter about the present.”</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div

mental health resources and addressing the climate crisis. </span><em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The search follows current UC President Janet Napolitano’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/upcoming-year-will-be-uc-president-napolitanos-last-in-office/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announcement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that she will be stepping down from her position on Aug. 1, 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion was held at UC Los Angeles, with students, faculty and UC system stakeholders sharing their advice, ideas and hopes for the type of president they would like to see next. Comments were directed to the </span><a href=\"https://presidentialsearch.universityofcalifornia.edu/special-committee.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special Committee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a temporary group appointed by the chair of the Board of Regents to consider and ultimately recommend a candidate for the position in question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ernesto Arciniega, a PhD student at UCLA, was first to speak. He articulated a desire for a president who, instead of admitting diverse students with the sole aim of fulfilling diversity quotas, “has a larger social consciousness, who truly commits to defend the voice of the voiceless,” a message that many other speakers echoed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 12 other student and faculty speakers at the public forum discussed college affordability, increasing mental health resources and addressing the climate crisis, but one of the most consistent demands raised by speakers that afternoon centered around electing a president who would resolve the contract dispute with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees 3299 (AFSCME) in the workers’ favor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME, one of the UC’s largest unions, has regularly gone on strike in the past few years over </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/afscme-calls-for-boycott-of-commencement-speakers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pay raises</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-06/afscme-files-six-new-unfair-labor-practice-complaints-against-uc-plans-to-strike-nov-13/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">minimum wage and outsourcing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under Janet [Napolitano]’s leadership, the UC has refused to provide the workers of AFSCME 3299 with a fair contract,” said Alexia Hatun, an undergraduate at UCLA. Hatun said she would like to see a UC president “who will respect the dignity of labor and that will end outsourcing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Michelle, a third-year labor studies major at UCLA, agreed with Hatun. Explaining that her friend, a residence hall housekeeper, works seven days a week and two other jobs in order to make a living, Michelle told the committee that she believes her friend is “employed by an entity that devalues her work.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is unacceptable and the UC should strive for better,” Michelle said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple speakers also emphasized that the new president should clearly indicate that the UC system will protect any undocumented students enrolled in the UC system from deportation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other stakeholders, like representatives from education organizations, K–12 teachers and UC alumni, spoke after students and faculty. Unlike the speakers before, stakeholders generally avoided direct criticism of Napolitano. Darlene V. Willis, co-founder of the Concerned Parents Alliance, was mostly alone in acknowledging that the next president will need to “help restore public trust and confidence in higher education institutions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, stakeholders suggested a more varied set of issues they would like the new UC president to tackle, though they did agree on a few common topics. One such topic was the need for increased collaboration between different educational systems in the state — as far back as pre-kindergarten — and with community colleges and the California State University system, according to speaker Carlos Iola.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s way more to be gained than lost through planned and purposeful partnerships,” said Anne Stanton of the Linked Learning Alliance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers mentioned that the transfer process in particular could be improved by such partnerships with community colleges, according to Darla Cooper, executive director of the Research and Planning Group, which focuses on increasing the success of California community colleges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooper said that prospective transfers “need a more holistic and integrated approach to ensure that they reach their ultimate goal of a bachelor’s degree and a better life for themselves and their families.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as applications to the UC system have continually surged, space is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the UC system, which Rachel Bonkovsky from the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools criticized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since 1980, we’ve built 23 prisons in the state, and we’ve opened the doors to one UC,” Bonkovsky said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next town hall will take place at UC Riverside on Jan. 16.

Finding a place to live is hard,” he said. “I slept on campus because I was too scared to go outside and look for housing as someone who’s a foster and formerly incarcerated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprise resonated on the Regents’ faces.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is horrifying to hear,” Regent Sherry Lansing said. “We should take action on this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources such as the UC Santa Barbara Guardian Scholars Program (GSP) and Berkeley Underground Scholars exist throughout the UC system, offering academic and career advising as well as scholarships for foster and formerly incarcerated students, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a lack of funding and outreach have limited their effectiveness, Borges and Hoang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borges elaborated on UC Berkeley’s own version of GSP — Berkeley Hope Scholars (BHS) — as an example. While BHS does supply emergency housing to students when dorms are closed during holidays, relatively few people know that they can apply for a space, and so most are “kicked out” during winter break, according to Borges, who added that acceptance is limited and based on a lottery system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, Borges said, students are forced into “the most inadequate” off-campus housing with mold, abusive or neglectful landlords and residents with little concern for their well-being. Securing more suitable arrangements would require parents to sign leases, money to pay deposits and a family tax history — but, as Hoang stated, “There’s no relying on mommy and daddy to get any of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a potential recourse, Borges said; passed years ago, California State Legislature bills </span><a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB1393\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB-1393</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1228\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB-1228</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> require the California Community Colleges and the California State University systems to give priority year-round housing to foster and homeless students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this requirement does not apply to the UC system until the Regents formally enact it into policy. And so far, according to Borges, they haven’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I’m here to ask,” she continued regarding the bills, “is to maybe put it on your radar.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond housing, Hoang proposed other changes that would benefit the foster and formerly incarcerated student population after graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His recommendations included awarding fellowships to alumni to compensate for the extra hands, resources and living space that parents would normally provide in an initial job search; hiring more foster and formerly incarcerated people as employees of the UC system, since they know best how to solve the problems that they themselves face every day; and re-evaluating the use of criminal background checks for certain jobs in the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoang said there is a combined, approximate total of 160 foster and formerly incarcerated students at UC Berkeley, based on the memberships of BHS and Berkeley Underground Scholars. However, he pointed out that, based on his research, the true count includes an “undetected number of about double that” — by including those who do not wish to make their history known due to the potential stigma in doing so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For their part, the Regents appeared receptive to the presenters’ suggestions. “I think those are recommendations we should seriously consider if we are truly committed to opening the doors to students who are not what we think of as a traditional student in the UC, which is primarily becoming the majority of students in higher education now,” Regent Eloy Ortiz Oakley stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the recommendations “seemed to be no-brainers to me,” said Regent Christine Simmons, who volunteered to head a task force to decide on short- and long-term changes within the UC system while conferring with Borges, Hoang, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ and other students interested in voicing their feedback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlighting the need for collaboration and communication to solve issues on a more fundamental level, Lansing advised broadening the task force. “It seems to me it shouldn’t just be us [implementing these recommendations] … I think it should be the community colleges, Cal State and obviously UC,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a crisis that we have to address.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91306\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91306\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-19/theres-no-relying-on-mommy-and-daddy-foster-and-formerly-incarcerated-students-share-their-stories-with-uc-regents/","id":3516,"author":{"id":237,"name":"Yiu-On Li"},"related":[3515,3514,3513],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bells, Towers and Bell Towers: Carillon Recital Celebrates Storke Tower’s 50th Anniversary","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Storke-50th_Bob-He_ONLINE_7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Storke-50th_Bob-He_ONLINE_7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The structure and the instrument resting within the tower were both gifts from the late Thomas M.

Speakers at the recital included Margo Halsted, former UCSB university carillonist; John Majewski, UCSB dean of humanities and fine arts and Nick Masuda, director of news at the Santa Barbara News-Press.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The structure and the instrument resting within the tower were both gifts from the late Thomas M. Storke, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and owner of the Santa Barbara News-Press for 32 years. During the dedication ceremony on Sept. 28, 1969, he stated: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is my hope that the publications coming from this building will be the finest examples of journalism developed on any campus in America — perhaps in the world.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the five decades since, the KCSB-FM radio station, La Cumbre yearbook and the Daily Nexus have made their homes at the base of the tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honoring this amount of history was no small task. According to Arai, almost a year was spent preparing for the semicentennial: “The thing that took the longest was to work with the two composers we commissioned to write new pieces for the event. I would say the resulting two pieces are one of the major successes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Golden Sounds,” by UCSB Professor Emeritus Emma Lou Diemer, was one of those pieces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I sat at the piano and held down the sustaining pedal to simulate the prolonged sounds of the carillon,” she wrote in an email, “and proceeded to write a piece that incorporated three different melodic elements and other musical ideas that are effective on the carillon.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second piece was “Fantasy on FIAT LUX” by world-renowned composer Aaron David Miller, which featured variations on the university motto “Fiat Lux” by the late Carl Zytowski, who was a UCSB professor of Music music for 44 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each letter of the motto spells out a musical theme which became the compositional material for the fantasy,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional pieces included “Piece Without Expression No. 1” by Frank Percival Price, “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” by Johann Sebastian Bach and “Fandango” by Ronald Barnes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instrument that made all of these performances possible was the carillon atop Storke Tower, which contains 61 bells and is one of only six such installations in California. It is played with fists and feet that strike a set of wooden keys each corresponding to a specific bell: the heavier the strike, the louder the sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The largest, lowest bells weigh up to 2.5 tons, while the smallest, highest ones can weigh as little as 13 pounds, so you need to be careful with the balance and not let the low bells totally bury the high bells,” Arai said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In principle, this is not too different from how someone would play a piano or an organ, but the similarities end there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes there’s a bit of trial and error, where something I arrange just ends up being impossible to play or doesn’t sound good on the bells and I need to rework it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these challenges, Arai, Diemer and Miller all agreed that the experience of playing a carillon is worth the learning curve, especially given the sweeping view of campus and the Pacific Ocean from atop Storke Tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is good to see and hear beyond and within one’s self,” Diemer wrote, and “it’s fun and exciting to create sounds with those 61 bells.” Miller invoked the concept of fun as well, writing that “I don’t know of another instrument you work up a sweat while playing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re by yourself, high up in the tower when you play, far away from any listeners,” and “at least for me, this can actually make performing somewhat relaxing, unlike if you were performing on a stage where you can see your audience staring at you,” Arai added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, more than the performance itself, and true to Storke Tower’s tradition of learning and community expression, passing on the knowledge of the carillon is the best perk that comes with playing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a bit more than just ringing the bells,” Arai said. Every quarter, he trains three students on how to play the carillon. “I think this is the most rewarding part, getting to work with enthusiastic, talented students and teaching them this very unique art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diemer agreed. “It all comes together sometimes: people, music, memories, creating, learning, never giving up, using one’s talents and perfecting them as much as possible, cherishing the marvelous gift of life, being thankful for all of that. But learning is probably the most important. Isla Vista is full of people who are doing just that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the event may be over, the celebration and education continue. The next carillon recitals will be held on Nov. 17 at 11 a.m. and Nov. 24 at 10 a.m. in front of Storke Tower. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/bells-towers-and-bell-towers-carillon-recital-celebrates-storke-towers-50th-anniversary/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/bells-towers-and-bell-towers-carillon-recital-celebrates-storke-towers-50th-anniversary/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/bells-towers-and-bell-towers-carillon-recital-celebrates-storke-towers-50th-anniversary/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/bells-towers-and-bell-towers-carillon-recital-celebrates-storke-towers-50th-anniversary/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/bells-towers-and-bell-towers-carillon-recital-celebrates-storke-towers-50th-anniversary/","id":1957,"author":{"id":237,"name":"Yiu-On Li"},"related":[1956,1955,1954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor Recount Breaking Harvey Weinstein Story at Campbell Hall","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71073546_10158838385198275_1004944217513918464_o.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71073546_10158838385198275_1004944217513918464_o.jpg?resize=980%2C628&ssl=1","description":"New York Times reporters Twohey and Jodi Kantor spoke to a packed Campbell Hall, breaking down, from its conception to its publication, their 2017 exposé of Weinstein’s decades of sexual misconduct...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been waiting for somebody to knock on my door for 25 years.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was not the response Megan Twohey had expected, not after tracking down the woman to her literal doorstep and not after Harvey Weinstein had sexually assaulted her more than two decades before, in 1990.

During the talk, the pair discussed the legacy of the movement and what has changed after two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two began by talking about their daughters. “When our investigation began, my daughter weighed 12 pounds” and “had never eaten a plate of solid food,” Twohey said. Kantor’s youngest daughter “liked grabbing phones so much that by the end of the summer, she had accidentally managed to FaceTime Ashley Judd.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good laugh from the audience later, Kantor then posed the question: “So when these girls are much older, what are we going to tell them about Harvey Weinstein?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weinstein was not the first to be accused of sexual misconduct. In particular, Kantor noted, the New York Times had published an article in April 2017 revealing how then-television host Bill O’Reilly paid out millions of dollars to women with numerous claims against him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With that in mind, the editors gathered a bunch of reporters — including me — and asked what now seems like a quaint question: ‘Are there </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> powerful men who have covered up inappropriate treatment of women?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a trail of whispers, Kantor explained that she eventually managed to hold off-the-record conversations with Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd, all of who “separately told me very harrowing stories about Harvey Weinstein and hotel rooms.” But for the most part, people were generally reluctant to share their experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair knew they needed to take a different approach than getting people on the record in order to implicate Weinstein. It was difficult enough to convince people to talk officially in the first place, but Kantor explained that they also needed concrete evidence in the form of settlements, human resource records and the testimonies of ex-Weinstein employees to avoid a “‘he said, she said’ kind of story.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two dug around and Twohey finally found the people who had been waiting 25 years for her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their cases, Kantor and Twohey could not print what they learned, but that’s not to say they didn’t learn anything. The first woman was legally prohibited from saying anything; the second woman’s husband denied any possibility of sexual assault due to a genuine lack of knowledge of what had happened to his wife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that by now, they had learned about the extreme restrictiveness of secret settlements. No matter how willing the victim is to speak, their silence was mandated by agreements signed years ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One call Twohey and Kantor made was to Irwin Reiter, Weinstein’s “gruff, loyal” accountant of 30 years. They did not expect him to help, but he ended up becoming a pivotal figure in the investigation, having become disillusioned with his boss after Weinstein’s obsession with sex became increasingly alarming. Reiter began sneaking Kantor details associated with Weinstein for the team to check out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night in September 2017, Reiter gave Kantor a memo to copy by employee Lauren O’Connor, who wrote statements along the lines of, “At this company, the balance of power is Harvey Weinstein: 10, me: 0.” The accusations in the memo, which described Weinstein’s acts in around 2014 and 2015, helped the investigation take on a new urgency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there were those seeking to undermine Twohey and Kantor’s progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Twohey, prominent attorney David Boies worked with Weinstein to silence his victims and, now, the New York Times piece by way of a $300,000-contract to former Israeli intelligence officials from private intelligence company Black Cube. Their objective was to “target” the sources and journalists behind the story and stop it from ever going to print. As Twohey put it, “It was basically a ‘hit’ on our project.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the final 48 hours before Kantor and Twoheypublished the story, the two presented Weinstein their findings and gave him a chance to tell his side of the story. As publication neared, Weinstein took on a more direct, confrontational role. Flanked by a small cadre of prominent attorneys and prosecutors, Twohey said he “barged” into the Times’ office with folders of photos showing women, some of them involved in allegations against him, smiling and acting happy next to him, along with information that was meant to discredit and embarrass them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were threatening lawsuits against us. They were basically bullying us and trying to attack us as individuals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of all of the work and risk put into the story, Kantor and Twohey still had doubts about whether anyone would care when the story was published. To the audience in Campbell Hall, Kantor asked, “Who here had never heard of Harvey Weinstein before this story?” Surveying the hands, she concluded, “A substantial number of people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were additionally concerned that not enough people would go on the record. Laura Madden, the only person who had agreed by that point to do so, nearly changed her mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twohey and Kantor learned their fears were unjustified, however, when Madden sent the pair a note that read, “I realize that time is short. I want my daughters to grow up in a different world. I am happy to go on the record.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Judd, meanwhile, came forward at the last minute as well, stating that “women have been talking about Harvey Weinstein for a long time privately, and it’s past time to start having the conversation publically.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the article was published.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turmoil ensued within the Weinstein Company and board members were split on what to do. Weinstein himself refused to go down quietly, Twohey and Kantor explained. “There are going to be women’s organizations that have my back,” he said, defending himself. “There are going to be dozens of them, and there’s gonna be a movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And … and there was!” Twohey responded with amusement along with the audience. “But not the kind he was predicting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Largely inspired by the revelations brought forward in the article, the #MeToo hashtag began trending on social media, used by both celebrity and non-famous individuals to share their own stories of sexual harassment and assault. But, two years later, what’s next?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kantor, there is a “mounting sense of unfairness about the issue on both sides”: Supporters and victims believe society hasn’t gone far enough in addressing sexism and power, and detractors, especially those accused of wrongdoing, believe society has gone too far without a “clear and sound process in place for evaluating these kinds of complaints.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citing increasing divisions within the movement, Twohey asks people to consider and reconsider the weight of sexual misconduct allegations, the vetting process and the extent to which those accused should be held accountable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kantor ends with her own questions on the legacy of #MeToo. Will her kids still see sexual harassment and assault as everyday occurrences? “Or, will we be able to say, ‘I was there when things changed?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t have all the answers to these questions,” Twohey contends; a journalist’s goal, she said, is to get the full story and have the reader draw their own conclusions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one thing Kantor wants to make clear is this: “You can’t solve a problem you can’t see.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90527\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-18/megan-twohey-and-jodi-kantor-recount-breaking-harvey-weinstein-story-at-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90527\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-18/megan-twohey-and-jodi-kantor-recount-breaking-harvey-weinstein-story-at-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-18/megan-twohey-and-jodi-kantor-recount-breaking-harvey-weinstein-story-at-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-18/megan-twohey-and-jodi-kantor-recount-breaking-harvey-weinstein-story-at-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-18/megan-twohey-and-jodi-kantor-recount-breaking-harvey-weinstein-story-at-campbell-hall/","id":1950,"author":{"id":237,"name":"Yiu-On Li"},"related":[1949,1948,1947],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/237"}},"__N_SSG":true}
