The week-long series of events are also tabled in collaboration with Committee on Committees and a variety of their other Boards, Committees and Commissions (BCCs).</p>\n<p>Today’s event, “A.S. Open House,” will take place at the A.S. Main Office in the Multicultural Center and will offer attendees time to network with A.S. officials. Tomorrow will feature two finance-related events called “Where’s My Money?” and “Teach the Budget.” Finally, Friday’s event, “Student Health Day,” will take place on the SRB Lawn to talk about mental, physical and sexual health.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Jonathan Abboud, the campaign was developed by the A.S. Office of the President. The week’s basic goal is to give students opportunities to learn about A.S. and decide whether it is a group they want to get involved in.</p>\n<p>“The project is to make visible all that Associated Students does and publicize Associated Students, get students more informed about where their money is going and what kind of activities we’re working on, especially before the election,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Monday’s event was “Sustainability Day,” which focused on the California drought as well as a number of other environmental issues in the county, especially regarding the coastline community of Santa Barbara. Members of the A.S. Office of the President, I.V. Tenants Union and Environmental Affairs Board also passed out reusable bags, pins supporting water conservation and free food from the I.V. Food Co-Op.</p>\n<p>Megan Roy, a fourth-year environmental studies major and Outreach and Education Coordinator of UCSB Coastal Fund, said the Coastal Fund is an A.S.-funded organization that provides grants for conservation projects for the local coast.</p>\n<p>“There are students who work in different labs, like bio labs … that directly relate to our mission statement of protecting, restoring and enhancing the coast,” Roy said. “It’s really cool to see a student come in and propose their project. We can fund their projects and make them happen.”</p>\n<p>Yesterday’s event was the “A.S. Recruitment Fair,” and at tomorrow’s event, “Where’s My Money?” A.S. will be distributing surveys to garner student input about how students think A.S. should allocate its $10.6 million budget.</p>\n<p>“Every year, we make a new budget, and that is a time we ask to students what they think is important to fund in the budget,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Also taking place tomorrow at the Student Resource Building (SRB) Multipurpose Room from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. will be “Teach the Budget,” a presentation on California’s budget and issues surrounding the financing of higher education.</p>\n<p>“Spring into A.S.” culminates on Friday at the SRB lawn with “Student Health Day.” A bounce house, free candy, condoms and lube will be provided at the event.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, Spring Quarter is when many opportunities open up in A.S. since all of the positions must be re-filled for the next school year. Some of these positions will be in the senate, executive office and BCCs.</p>\n<p>“All the positions in A.S. only last one year, so all 300-plus positions completely turn over every year,” Abboud said. “On top of that, they are employment positions. There’s probably close to 600 to 700 opportunities in A.S. total.”</p>\n<p>Aiden Brorsen, a second-year history of public policy major and Chair of the Committee on Committees, also said he believes now is an ideal time to start getting involved.</p>\n<p>“We are preparing students from spring to summer as opposed to just fall, so it’s kind of like a transitional event,” Brorsen said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54551\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54551\" data-attachment-id=\"54551\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/the-arbor-springs-into-a-s-this-week/springas_petervandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=3832%2C2833&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3832,2833\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1367591152\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"185\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=888%2C656&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-54551\" alt=\"SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt-250x184.jpg?resize=250%2C184\" width=\"250\" height=\"184\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-54551\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Spring into A.S.” holds a number of events this week to encourage student involvement in allocation of funds and office positions.

During the rally, COSWB will be tabling on campus to offer information and resources on sexual violence, with the help of the Campus Advocacy Resources and Education program. They will also be providing food and refreshments during the event. The rally is organized by the UCSB chapter of VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood, a national pro-choice advocacy group for college students, as well as by Associated Students, A.S. Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB) and Pink Research, a UCSB breast cancer awareness and research group.</p>\n<p>Daisy Fernandez, a first-year sociology and feminist studies double major and VOX member, said she hopes the rally will remind the students and non-students residing in I.V. that sexual assault happens all the time and is underreported.</p>\n<p>“[We] just want to remind that even though each time it happens we all feel really bad … it’s not just those times that it happens — it’s a thing all year round,” Fernandez said.</p>\n<p>Simone Webster, fourth-year religious studies major and VOX Co-Chair, said the march is just the beginning of what she hopes will be a larger effort to get the I.V. community involved in sexual assault prevention. According to Webster, this event marks a “kind of entrance” to the other activities and work VOX hopes to do in the future.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to start up a neighborhood watch with other organizations; we’re still working out the kinks on that,” Webster said. “From there, we are working on what we can actively do not only as students but as a community because UCSB students are not the only people that live in I.V. — there are Santa Barbara City College students and just residents in general.”</p>\n<p>According to Fernandez, the group is also working with A.S. Senate to improve lighting in I.V. and adjust “outdated” laws governing how the UC deals with sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the streets are super, super dark and really scary,” Webster said. “We always have to tell — more girls than guys — to call CSO [officers], but it’s not addressing the actual problem.”</p>\n<p>Fernandez said she hopes the rally will create a safe place for any previous victims of sexual assault and give them the comfort of a support group.</p>\n<p>“Hey, we’re here for you,” Fernandez said. “Help us help you in any way you want, whether you want a day of silence or anything you want us to give you — any way we can help out.”</p>\n<p>Webster said she hopes to see students, faculty members, advisors, the vice chancellor and other “big honchos of the school” at the rally. While she believes students can play an important role in combatting sexual violence in I.V., Webster said the issue can be better addressed and tackled with the combined efforts of students and non-students.</p>\n<p>“I want to go beyond just UCSB students,” Webster said. “I want everyone out here to make a conscious effort to be proactive and look out for each other.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared as an online exclusive on Friday, March 7, 2014.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/","id":3022,"author":{"id":185,"name":"Michael Coronado"},"related":[3021,3020,3019],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ballin’ Workshop Teaches Students Budgeting Basics","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Ballin’ on a Budget,” a workshop which took place last night in the Student Resource Building, tutored students in “financial basics,” such as creating and managing a budget and applying fo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Student Resource Building Hosts Workshop For Basic Financing Techniques</h3>\n<p>“Ballin’ on a Budget,” a workshop which took place last night in the Student Resource Building, tutored students in “financial basics,” such as creating and managing a budget and applying for a credit card.</p>\n<p>The event was hosted by third-year feminist studies major Rachel McCormack of the Women’s Center and Jose Raygoza, coordinator and advisor for the Associated Students Community Financial Fund, which offers increased access to grants and A.S. emergency loans. Beginning with a presentation about how students can figure out how to effectively spend money on a budget, the presentation later gave a detailed look at how credit works.</p>\n<p>According to Raygoza, budgeting is an essential skill everyone, especially students, should know, particularly in light of numerous expenses such as “paying for books next quarter, or going on vacation” and “traveling abroad” in the midst of rising tuition costs and other strains on student finances.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has dreams and goals, and everyone can achieve them,” Raygoza said. “A good way to start planning towards your goals is to create a financial spending plan.”</p>\n<p>However, while having a spending plan is important, Raygoza noted that even more important than sticking to a plan is to defer from overspending, which can be difficult amidst what he said is the plethora of purchasable temptations in today’s consumer culture.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of choices in how we spend our money,” Raygoza said.</p>\n<p>While saying that spending money on entertainment can be important to one’s well-being, Raygoza said it is essential to determine how much can be allocated to certain expenses. To do this, Raygoza said students should keep a spending diary for a month and reconsider what classifies as ‘needs’ and ‘wants.’ He also recommended developing cost-cutting habits, such as using public transportation, attending free events, volunteering, brewing your own coffee and taking advantage of student discounts.</p>\n<p>“Ballin’ on a Budget” presenters also discussed interest and annual percentage rates, the usefulness of credit for emergency purchases and larger expenses, as well as the differences between debit, credit, ATM and stored value cards. Speakers also recommended finding out credit scores through Equifax, Experian, TransUnion and <em>www.annualcreditreport.com.</em></p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Amanda Pheng, who attended the event, said the workshop was useful in terms of bettering her understanding of how to handle personal finances.</p>\n<p>“It is stressful. I have to worry about utilities, gas, groceries and other stuff like that. It’s hard sometimes to figure what I need to spend and what I have money for,” Pheng said. “I think it’s always good to budget yourself a little bit better.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Wednesday, January 29, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53769\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53769\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/","id":3139,"author":{"id":185,"name":"Michael Coronado"},"related":[3138,3137,3136],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/185"}},"__N_SSG":true}
