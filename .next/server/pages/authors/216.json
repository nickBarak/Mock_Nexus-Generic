Executive Director Marisela Marquez rejected the question on the grounds that it was too specific for Wednesday night’s public Legislative Council meeting, prompting Bishop to clarify that her query described a hypothetical scenario involving any chair of any committee.</p>\n<p>Seemingly satisfied, Marquez explained how and why she utilizes preemptive action to follow through on impulses of keen perception and dispel the dangers of the unknown.</p>\n<p>“If you’re talking about, say, the Internal Vice President, it doesn’t have a vote but there is a great deal of pressure that could be brought on them, potentially,” Marquez said. “At the very least, there’s a perception of a conflict of interest; that’s the issue we’re charged with making sure doesn’t happen. If these are potentially two trains that are going to cross and derail, then why wait until it gets derailed?”</p>\n<p>Under the direction of Marquez, A.S. Associate Director for Special Projects Denise Rinaldi threatened to exercise the permanent staff’s power to terminate student employees in an ultimatum offered to former Judicial Council chair Jeanne Sabin. Given the choice to keep either her job as Legislative Council’s minute-taker — a title she’s held for three years that provides a consistent, hourly income — or her newly-appointed position as the non-voting chair of Judicial Council, Sabin tearfully resigned from the latter on Sept. 28.</p>\n<p>Sabin declined to comment, saying she feared repercussions from the permanent staff.</p>\n<p>Many members of the council, including Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker, spoke out against Marquez’s claim that holding the two positions at once could present a plausible conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>“Because she’s the minute-taker of Legislative Council and she doesn’t hold an elected position … All she does is listen to what’s said and write it down,” Stryker said. “Students from both parties were really outraged.”</p>\n<p>A council member brought the issue of inconsistent policy enforcement to the meeting’s forefront when he attempted to explain how he knows other students who hold similar dual positions within A.S., but was interrupted when Stryker requested that he “try not to be specific, please.”</p>\n<p>According to On-Campus Representative Kristian Whittaker, Marquez spoke to council members at Legislative Council’s retreat last weekend and encouraged them to consider holding closed meetings and speaking cryptically during open meetings to avoid controversy. While Article VI, Section 1 allows Legislative Council to hold closed meetings with the approval of two-thirds of the members, Whittaker said Marquez’s recommendations extended beyond conducting private business behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>“Well, what we would do is we would ask for the person [at the podium] to present an example that would be similar to the situation, but not so much exactly the situation,” Whittaker[[ok]] said.</p>\n<p>In spite of her own recommendations, Marquez allowed the violation of mandated vagueness and asked a favor of the council.</p>\n<p>“Staff would prefer not to do those dual appointments, so if you have those folks that you want to point out to me, that would be helpful,” Marquez said in complete seriousness as many council members and attendees failed to stifle their laughter.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Jonathan Abboud said whether or not the contentious policy is permitted, allegations of a conflict of interest simply do not make sense in Sabin’s case.</p>\n<p>“Jeanne is the most unbiased person in A.S.,” Abboud said. “I don’t think she would be biased at all, and that’s why I was so opposed to her being put in that position. … We were all really confused, like, ‘Did this just happen? Seriously?’”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Article VI, Section 2 of the Legal Code recognizes the A.S. President’s clear authority over the Executive Director, stating that “The President shall: 1) Be the Chief Executive Officer of the Associated Students and shall coordinate and be responsible for the functioning of the A.S. Executive Director.”</p>\n<p>Abboud cited Sabin’s excellent record with Presidents past and current as another compelling and legally verified reason to allow her to serve in both roles.</p>\n<p>“[Jeanne] has seen three different Legislative Councils, three different Presidents and she’s taken the minutes consistently,” Abboud said. “She really wanted to get involved in A.S. as an appointed member and that’s when she went to Judicial Council because that’s what she thought she’d be good at, and two different Presidents thought she would be good at that job — Harrison and Paul.”</p>\n<p>Former A.S. President J.P. Primeau, who served during the 2008-09 school year, said he often clashed with permanent staff members in a continuous struggle for authority.</p>\n<p>“One of my key goals as President was to change the relationship between students and administrators,” Primeau wrote in the A.S. 08-09 Annual Report. “I had always felt that, despite our tremendous ability to organize and advocate, we reacted to university policy after it had been established (Minimum Cumulative Progress being the prime example). To change that policy students would need to take a more proactive approach based on shared governance — simply put, more students needed to be at the table when big decisions were made.”</p>\n<p>Third Supervisorial District Representative for Santa Barbara County Democratic Central Committee and Mixed Student Union Co-Chair Nicole Leopardo, who ran for External Vice President of Local Affairs with the Democratic Process Party last Spring, said the staff’s hard work often goes unappreciated but has also threatened the autonomy of various groups and members within the organization.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I want the permanent staff to step in and make decisions because I feel like they might be the most logical people in some situations, but other times, like with this situation, [students] should be able to make their decisions,” Leopardo said. “Harrison should be able to make his appointments. That’s not saying we can’t be critical of him, but I just don’t know how I feel about permanent staff kind of stomping on his decisions.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Leopardo said she’s shocked by the permanent staff’s lack of legislative authorization for their interference in students’ jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>“There’s no one to check them,” Leopardo said. “There’s no one to say, ‘Hey, you’re not doing your job,’ and that’s what we as students should be doing. There is no democratic process; there are no checks and balances. Right now, it’s a difficult situation.”</p>\n<p>Sabin’s removal leaves the council below quorum with only two remaining members. As such, it cannot function as a judiciary body nor can it move forward with proceedings on currently unresolved cases, such as one from last Spring involving several members of Open People’s Party.</p>\n<p>As a result of unsubstantiated allegations, four elected Legislative Council members were removed from their positions and replaced by the four closest runners-up despite the fact that Judicial Council has yet to reach a ruling. The council is currently seeking applicants and was expected to resolve the case this quarter after accepting the accused party’s petition for a hearing in late May.</p>\n<p>Stryker said any students with concerns can contact the Attorney General or submit a petition or file a case with Judicial Council, which will be reviewed as soon as the entity reaches its quorum of three members.</p>\n<p>In the interim, Abboud said he will be working with the ad hoc committee to put measures in place to protect student employee rights.</p>\n<p>“My personal goal would be to codify exactly what rights A.S. [student] employees have,” Abboud said. “Do they or do they not have the right to be appointed members of A.S.? Personally, I would want them to have that right; probably everyone on Legislative Council does, but I’m not going to speak for them — I can’t — but it seems that she should be able to participate in A.S. and take our minutes.”</p>\n<p>Stryker said while maintaining a working balance between the staff and the students can be taxing, a unified Legislative Council can reinstate its ultimate authority by ballot, if needed.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really tough relationship between the staff end of A.S. and the Legal Code part of A.S. because there’s nothing really in the Legal Code that gives any protection over the students when it comes to what happens if admin disagrees, except for the Executive Director — she can be voted out by three-fourths of Legislative Council.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The first installment of this article can be found at the following location: http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-10-06/director-intrudes-student-rights/</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/","id":3126,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3125,3124,3123],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fraud Claims Arise in A.S.","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"An annual external audit of UCSB’s Associated Students revealed potential embezzlement within the organization during the 2009-2010 fiscal year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>An annual external audit of UCSB’s Associated Students revealed potential embezzlement within the organization during the 2009-2010 fiscal year.</p>\n<p>The written report given to A.S. Legislative Council members on Tuesday indicated a possible misappropriation of an undisclosed amount of A.S. funds by an employee within the organization. However, the auditors’ presentation at the Legislative Council meeting last night failed to include any verbal mention of fraud.</p>\n<p>The review of A.S. financial statements from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 by public accounting firm Nasif, Hicks, Harris &amp; Co., LLP showed extensive growth within the organization since 2009. Net assets increased $373,634 since 2009 to $4,284,517 in 2010, with total assets listed at $4,434,049 due to $149,532 in total current liabilities.</p>\n<p>Total revenues and gains increased more than $70,000 from $10,958,473 in 2009 to $11,032,165 in 2010 while total expenses and losses increased nearly $515,000 from $10,143,921 in 2009 to $10,658,531 in 2010. The increased expenses were composed primarily of a $208,684 boost in staff salaries and an additional $223,870 in university support.</p>\n<p>The majority of A.S. revenue is generated through lock-in fees and sales of services and products such as the A.S. Bike Shop and other programs. In 2006, students voted to increase the A.S. lock-in fee referendum by $100 per quarter, effectively tripling student contributions to the organization.</p>\n<p>According to Mark Jackson, who presented on behalf of the auditors, nearly all of A.S. funding comes from this fee. In 2010, 91 percent of A.S.’s revenue came from the student lock-in fee.</p>\n<p>After the audit presentation, council members made numerous amendments to the Elections Committee Modifications Bill that governs campus elections to clarify points within the bill including endorsements and jurisdiction over elections.</p>\n<p>Off-campus representative Joe Lewis said the bill’s language needs clarification so current elected officials can not use their current position to influence voter opinion.</p>\n<p>“I think we should change the wording about endorsements to deliberately using your title to endorse a candidate,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>The council passed an amendment stating no money allocated by A.S. to any special interest, registered groups or appointed officers either fully or partially funded by A.S. can be used in endorsements.</p>\n<p>The council also argued over consequences for breaking endorsement restrictions. As originally written, elected officials lose honoraria if they break endorsement guidelines and executive officers lose spring quarter tuition as well.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-large Chloe Stryker said the bill should specify which entity possesses jurisdiction to rule on violations of elections policy.</p>\n<p>“I think we need to follow the legal code to avoid Judicial Council hearings,” Stryker said. “It’s just too hard to give [elections committee] all power the entire year and not known when Leg Council has power.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus representative Amanda Berry said elections committee had too much control in the decision.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s fair for elections committee, which has so few people, to be able to take away an exec’s entire tuition and their honoraria,” Berry said.</p>\n<p>Elections committee chair Sunjeet Gill said the committee’s recommendations were based on prior experience.</p>\n<p>“It’s not ok for you to be a leader on campus and break the rules and just pay a fee for that,” Gill said. “We want people to be afraid of breaking rules; that’s why we put it into effect. This is like a concrete punishment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/","id":3155,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3154,3153,3152],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Arnold Schwarzenegger’s allocation wasn’t enough to lift the University out of its financial deficit. According to A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Doug Wagoner, UCSB will still face a $439.9 million shortfall in 2011-12.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Wagoner said UC VP of Budget Patrick Lenz alluded to future fee hikes for UC students during a UC Student Association board meeting over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“[Lenz] danced around the fact that there’s probably going to be a 20 percent student fee increase in November and he also didn’t answer any of our questions very well,” Wagoner said. “I encourage you all to research more into the budget to see where the money’s going in our dire state.”</p>\n<p>The council also discussed the 1993 court case Smith v. Regents, which prohibits the use of student fees to lobby any proposition or candidate. A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez cautioned the council to remember its expenses are regularly audited in compliance with Smith v. Regents.</p>\n<p>“Taking a position either way on an issue is not a violation of Smith v. Regents,” Marquez said. “What is a violation is spending any student fees to defeat or support any particular proposition or candidate. However, the educational process is not a political process; I’d be putting out the message that we’re investing in the educational mission.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez questioned the legality of funding a group such as the Rock the Vote campaign, if the organization used the money to favor of a local candidate.</p>\n<p>Marquez recommended the council seek her advice when unsure whether an allocation was in line with Smith v. Regents, Off-Campus Representative and Finance Board member Chloe Stryker requested Marquez give a similar talk about the case at Monday’s Finance Board meeting.</p>\n<p>“If you had come and given that presentation [last] Monday, that probably would have changed the outcome a lot,” Stryker said.</p>\n<p>Marquez then went on to discuss the Associated Students’ role in Steve Pappas’ lawsuit against Board of Supervisors Representative Doreen Farr, in which Pappas claimed that the Associated Students had potentially mishandled registration forms during the 2008 election. Though the case was dropped, Pappas has recently appealed the decision.</p>\n<p>“A.S. and the campus itself were subpoenaed as witnesses, and we were compelled to respond,” Marquez said. “We need to comply because the suspicion is that Associated Students was conducting voter registration that wasn’t following election code. We’re potentially involved, and that’s something you should all be aware of.”</p>\n<p>Lastly, Wagoner congratulated UCSA’s recent voter registration effort on campus. As of 11:30 Tuesday night, 5,284 UCSB student voters had registered for the upcoming election. UCSA hopes to register a total of 7,000 voters by the end of the drive on Monday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/","id":3147,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3146,3145,3144],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Who’s Who on Campus","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As UCSB students, it’s easy to identify what makes our peers flock to the university...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As UCSB students, it’s easy to identify what makes our peers flock to the university; the student body is politically savvy and environmentally conscious, its scholars are awarded top honors on a regular basis and off-campus housing is located in an area that can be fittingly described as a beach paradise.</p>\n<p>What’s often overlooked by the student body are the requirements to ensure smooth day-to-day operations at the university.

Yang</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A former dean of engineering and distinguished professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University, Chancellor Henry T. Yang is — quite literally — a rocket scientist.</p>\n<p>Since joining UCSB in 1994 as both chancellor and a professor of mechanical engineering, Yang has seen the university weather a heavy storm. While economic recession has made marks worldwide, its effects have been particularly brutal on state education.</p>\n<p>Despite substantial efforts to combat the devastating budget cuts, Yang said the end of the UC’s fiscal maelstrom is nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p>“Our challenge this year is to sustain the remarkable momentum of our progress while continuing to absorb the state budget cuts,” Yang said in an e-mail. “Despite these budget challenges, we remain absolutely unwavering in our commitment to providing our students with the quality education they deserve. After all, our students are the reason we are here.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, one of his most challenging tasks is communicating effectively with groups such as the UC Office of the President, alumni, donors, community members and representatives in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., to make sure that his decisions are well-informed and well-received.</p>\n<p>“It is important for all voices to be heard so that each person becomes a true partner in the process,” Yang said. “I think that’s what makes UC Santa Barbara so special — we are not just a university, we are also a community.”</p>\n<p>Yang is also well-known for demonstrating his commitment to the heart of the university: its student body. While some high-level administrators struggle to schedule time to spend with their student body, Yang said he thrives on it.</p>\n<p>“My wife, Dilling, and I are privileged to live on campus, near our residence halls and dining commons,” he said. “One of the most enjoyable parts of our daily campus life is getting to know our students — sharing dinner at the dining commons, cheering at student performances and athletic events, talking with students during our regular walks around campus and Isla Vista and working with our students on campus issues.”</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26804\" style=\"width: 191px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"903102166\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26804\" data-attachment-id=\"26804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/gene-lucas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"gene lucas\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Glenn (Gene) Lucas&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"gene lucas\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26804\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-26804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Glenn (Gene) Lucas</p></div></span><strong>Glenn (“Gene”) Lucas</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Executive Vice Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A UCSB alumnus himself, Gene Lucas went on to earn a Sc.D. degree at MIT before returning to UCSB in 1978 to teach at the College of Engineering.

In between then and now, the credit for the striking physical appearance of today’s university goes to the likes of Marc Fisher and his predecessors.</p>\n<p>Fisher oversees Design and Construction Services, Campus Planning and Design, Housing and Residential Services and Physical Facilities, just to name a few. As a licensed architect with a Master’s degree in the field, Fisher is the man with the plan — actually, quite a few of them. Over the last eight years, he and his colleagues have developed the 2010 Long Range Development Plan, Campus Plan, Campus Housing Study, Campus Sustainability Plan and Physical Design Framework.</p>\n<p>Fisher said he looks forward to seeing the extensive work turn into tangible — not to mention environmentally-friendly — results.</p>\n<p>“This is an exciting time for our campus,” Fisher said in an e-mail. “It will be a campus that takes full advantage of our physical setting, is rich in texture and yet orderly in form, with many new housing options for our students, faculty and staff. It will be a campus that relies more heavily upon bicycle and pedestrian circulation and will continue to push into new areas of sustainability.”</p>\n<p>In addition to allowing him to utilize his passion for architecture, Fisher said his role at the university has given him the opportunity to join a tight-knit community.</p>\n<p>“My job entails so much variety — it is truly never dull,” he said. “I get to work with great people and have direct access to a cross section of our campus community — students, faculty and staff — as well as our local community.  Along with all of that, we are building and serving a campus environment commensurate with the academic excellence of this university.”</p>\n<p><span></span><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1634231109\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26800\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/young/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"young\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Michael Young&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"young\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-26800\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><strong>Michael Young</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs</strong></p>\n<p>As UCSB students, we know that a university is defined by more than what goes on inside its classrooms. It would be safe to say that Michael Young is responsible for almost everything else.</p>\n<p>As the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Young oversees more than 20 departments, including admissions, counseling, Student Health and the MultiCultural Center. After 20 years on the job, Young said his favorite part has always been — and will continue to be — his connection with the student body.</p>\n<p>“I know this will sound corny, but I really love working with UCSB students,” Young said. “I feel that I lucked out and ended up in a great career, in a great place for students. I’ve also had some extraordinary colleagues here in Santa Barbara and it’s been an absolute joy working with these professionals, trying to do our best to serve students here.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, the opportunity to develop a strong relationship with the student body is a double-edged sword.</p>\n<p>“At times in my job, I have a responsibility for either life-or-death matters relative to students or I have to become involved in situations where the academic careers of certain students are at risk,” Young said. “I’ve found that, even after all these years — and I’m glad of this — it has not come easy. It’s pretty sobering. Every time I am engaged in one of those situations, I am reminded that each and every student is an individual with a life and with a family, with dreams and hopes.”</p>\n<p>Although the Division of Student Affairs has been suffering at least $1 million of cutbacks a year for the past seven consecutive years, Young said he is determined to shield students from the repercussions.</p>\n<p>“[My goal] is to find out the impacts and the implications of the budget situation and then respond to that so that we can find ways to live within our new financial realities and continue to provide high-quality services to students,” Young said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/","id":3498,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3497,3496,3495],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/216"}},"__N_SSG":true}
