President Austin Hechler, however, has been the first to take action since its original proposal, and Senators Alex Giolito and Riley Hobson have authored the most recent version.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giolito credited Hechler for the work he has done to revive the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In recent history, what brought this all together was Austin Hechler and his work with the ROTC program through talking with a number of different members of it whom he worked with for this project,” Giolito said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Hechler’s outreach to ROTC, Giolito and Hobson began to draft the bill. The bill outlines problems that have existed for UCSB students in the ROTC program, such as the challenge of attending morning classes after morning workouts, managing major classes and keeping up with ROTC requirements while balancing their schedules. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This bill has garnered support from a variety of individuals, including both current and former UCSB ROTC members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill includes a letter from current ROTC Cadet Austin Amato, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, to the Academic Senate. In the letter, Amato said he supports the potential results that priority registration could bring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I had the opportunity to utilize priority registration, I would have been more competitive in ROTC, better prepared for classes and perhaps had the opportunity to further immerse myself into other activities and clubs around campus, such as the TMP [Technology Management Program] program,” he said in the letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, the interim co-dean of undergraduate education for the College of Letters &amp; Science, said he also supports this bill. He said that with prior registration, those enrolled in the ROTC program would have fewer quarters of academic advising since they will be able to better follow their pre-approved academic schedules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This will benefit the ROTC cadets, and by reducing workload in our understaffed office, indirectly benefit all Letters &amp; Science students,” Stopple said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Senate’s approval, the bill will now be evaluated by the Academic Senate. If it passes there, it will then go into effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“ROTC students are a respected portion of the student body and should certainly be rewarded by our school for their dedication and service to the ROTC program,” Hobson said. “I can’t think of any better way to do this than by making their schedules easier by allowing ROTC students to pick their classes with priority.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/","id":2405,"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher"},"related":[2404,2403,2402],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Installation of Signals In Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Traffic-lights-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Traffic-lights-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara County officials spoke at the A.S.

Senator Alex Giolito last week prompted county officials to come sooner.</p>\n<p>The petition calls for the termination of the project and urges alternative methods of controlling the intersection’s traffic flow to be considered.</p>\n<p>“I know they spent a lot of work on it and appreciate them addressing the current solution, but I believe alternatives can still be reached,” Giolito said.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Giolito said the signal would stop hundreds of bikes during rush hour and thus “clog” the intersection.</p>\n<p>McKarrell said Isla Vista Foot Patrol recognized the intense volume of traffic at the Pardall intersection almost a decade ago in 1998. However, it was not until 2007 that possible solutions were discussed. In 2013, county officials proposed the idea of a traffic signal.</p>\n<p>“I think it will actually help the bikes and pedestrians to all get through, and people will always know who has the right of way,” McGolpin said.</p>\n<p>Bert Johnson emphasized the simplicity of the traffic light’s design, noting that the signal would include an additional mast arm clearly visible to bikers so they will be able to see the signal before arriving at the intersection.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Giolito asked if county officials had considered the possibility of cars speeding on the six-and-a-half-block stretch of Embarcadero Del Norte, from Embarcadero Hall to Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>Johnson said the Santa Barbara Public Works Department has found that car speeds average around 29 miles per hour. He added that after the signal is installed, they will test the speeds again to ensure they do not exceed the 30-mile-per-hour range.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator Aaron Hendizadeh asked the officials about how the new traffic light would be enforced.</p>\n<p>According to McKarrell, the I.V. Foot Patrol will initially implement a warning period for people who do not abide by the new traffic light. He said after a certain period of time, if people do not adhere to the signal, then enforcement will begin.</p>\n<p>McKarrell added, however, that the most important aspect of enforcing the signal is the safety of pedestrians and bikers at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“The only tools we have are educating the community on how to be safe and the other is enforcement,” McKarrell said. “The officers don’t want to come out here and start handing out citations. We have matters that are much more serious, but it is your safety that’s paramount.”</p>\n<p>The officials addressed alternative solutions to the signal, such as additional bike lanes in I.V. or funneling bike traffic more evenly to and from campus from I.V.; however, all of these solutions were “too multilayered” to be deemed feasible.</p>\n<p>The officials suggested future discussions about the traffic signal closer to the beginning of the signal’s construction.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly named A.S.

Half of the funding will come from the public works department and the other half from UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The project will begin in late summer, and the department estimates the project will take four to six weeks. The county will determine a specific start date after removing pre-existing streetlight infrastructure at the intersection.</p>\n<p>Given the high traffic at the intersection, the construction will occur almost entirely on the sidewalk area. Some street shoulders are expected to be closed.</p>\n<p>The intersection has two stop signs for northbound and southbound traffic, giving eastbound and westbound traffic the right of way at all times.</p>\n<p>An increase in bike and car traffic over the years contributed to the change. Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, presented the project at an I.V. Community Network Meeting in January.</p>\n<p>“This project should provide a much more orderly and functional intersection, safely integrating bicycle, pedestrian and auto traffic,” George Thurlow, the university’s liaison for I.V. affairs, said.</p>\n<p>The original plan involved the installation of two traffic signals, one at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte and the other at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p>The county determined that only one signal was necessary with the hope that the signal on Embarcadero Del Norte will cause sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic at the Embarcadero Del Mar intersection.</p>\n<p>The county also proposed a four-way stop and a roundabout for this intersection, but officials concluded that neither would be able to safely sustain the amount of people on bikes coming through the intersection.</p>\n<p>“It really came down to a traffic signal,” McGolpin said. “It will allow the bikes that are coming out of the campus to see the red bulb and slow down a little bit and allow the signal to go through a 15–20-second cycle. It’s definitely going to be new for I.V.”</p>\n<p>Pegeen Soutar, the I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District board chair and a 35-year I.V. resident, said she has noticed cars and delivery trucks having difficulty crossing while students ride their bicycles during the busiest times of the day.</p>\n<p>“Safety is the biggest concern,” she said. “Whatever is put there, I hope people are paying attention and being careful.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story previously said the stoplight was funded by a grant.

The project aims to make Isla Vista and its roads more pedestrian-friendly. <em>Pei Chiao Lin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Representatives from Santa Barbara County announced Thursday that the county will be installing a continuous sidewalk through Sabado Tarde Road in the spring.</p>\n<p>According to Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, the county will add more sidewalks on the 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road. Curb ramps will be placed in several intersections along Sueno Road.</p>\n<p>Residents of these parts of Sabado Tarde Road will not have to wait long for the completion of this project. McGolpin projects it will be underway in the beginning of this spring, and he estimates construction will take approximately three months.</p>\n<p>This project, which bears a cost of $750,000, is being funded equally by the Santa Barbara County Community Development Block Grant Program and UC Santa Barbara. Each is allocating $2 million for this project and similar public works projects in the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>According to George Thurlow, UCSB special assistant for Isla Vista affairs, the project is part of the “joint county-university” safety improvements in Isla Vista. He said the University has pledged $2 million over the next 10 years to be matched by the county for sidewalks, streetlights and traffic improvements.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to have sidewalks on at least one side of all the streets in Isla Vista,” he said.</p>\n<p>The project is a continuation of an effort by the Santa Barbara Public Works Department to make Isla Vista more pedestrian-friendly. It was preceded by sidewalk installment projects on Del Playa Drive and Sueno Road throughout the last several years.</p>\n<p>“The community originally didn’t have sidewalks,” McGolpin said. “It takes time and money, and we’re slowly chipping away at it.”</p>\n<p>As of now, continuous sidewalks are sparse in Isla Vista. The county installed a long stretch of sidewalks along Del Playa Drive in 2002, and other streets have received segments of sidewalks over the following years. There are still many blocks in Isla Vista that do not have a consistent stretch of sidewalk.</p>\n<p>“Normally in California the way sidewalks get constructed is when you have an area that is going to be developed, you decide you want sidewalks and then you require developers to provide a sidewalk in front of their section of land,” said Jay Freeman, an 18-year Isla Vista resident and board member of the Isla Vista Community Services District.</p>\n<p>However, this was not the case during the development of Isla Vista. Although certain houses in the designated area of Sabado Tarde Road already have a sidewalk in front of them, they were installed during housing redevelopment.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said the project seeks to change this so that every house on these blocks has a sidewalk without having to redevelop properties.</p>\n<p>Another motive for this sidewalk project is to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In recent years, long-time Isla Vista residents have advocated for easier wheelchair access throughout the town, a large reason for the increase in sidewalks and curb ramps.</p>\n<p>These projects will have a focus on public and safety improvements, as well as “traffic-calming”<br>\nmeasures.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of
