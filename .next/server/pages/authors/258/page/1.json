The leaves change colors (at least in other states), Thanksgiving and winter break are right around the corner and, of course, a new NBA season is about to begin. If that’s not something to get excited about, I don’t know what is.</p>\n<p>Although we will probably get another Warriors title championship this year, that doesn’t mean we’re going to be like Eric Bledsoe at a barbershop and want to leave for greener pastures. There are a lot of interesting possibilities this year, and here are three situations to keep an eye on.</p>\n<p><strong>Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors</strong><strong>   </strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The last time we saw Kawhi Leonard play, he was a top MVP candidate, someone who looked like he was about to dominate the league offensively while allowing approximately zero points to be scored on him. However, that was a long time ago, and perceptions change. After taking a year off to recover from a mysterious quad injury that forced the Spurs to trade him, he was dealt to the Raptors in exchange for DeMar DeRozan.</p>\n<p>All we know about him so far in Toronto is that he is a fun guy who will probably never pass for a normal person. However, his fit with Toronto could be amazing. If he returns to MVP form, a team that was already a great defense with DeRozan, who seems to enjoy when people dribble by him, could end up being the top defense in the league. Pair that with the addition of Danny Green, a 3-and-D specialist who was also acquired in the San Antonio trade, and they could have a great offense built around Kawhi. They still have a fantastic bench unit as well as Kyle Lowry, the NBA version of a bulldog.</p>\n<p>They could put out a small ball unit that absolutely terrorizes teams on defense and can force favorable mismatches on offense. This is all assuming that Kawhi returns to pre-injury form, but if he does, a team with the best regular season record in the East last year could be much better.</p>\n<p><strong>The Celtics and Chemistry Issues</strong></p>\n<p>On paper, the Celtics are one of the best teams, if not the very best, in the East. Last year, missing two All-Stars, they were one Lebron James away from being in the NBA Finals. This year, Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward both return, and both are reportedly in good health. The question is how they will be able to manage the demands of individual players. No other team besides the Warriors has as much talent throughout the lineup as the Celtics, and the Warriors are the rare team that can combine talent and unselfishness to make dynastic level talent work out.</p>\n<p>The last time we saw the Celtics, Terry Rozier was being very scary, Jayson Tatum was the primary scorer and Jaylen Brown was the second in command on the wing. This year, however, with as many wing scorers as they have combined with the touches Kyrie will have, it will be interesting to see if they can keep all the talent happy enough to stay together. Al Horford will still put together an underrated season built on passing, spacing the floor and rebounding,  but how the rest of the lineup will interact with each other remains to be seen. Brad Stevens does have a great coaching record so far, but he’s never had a complete season coaching this talented of a team, and it will be interesting to see how he uses all the pieces he has been given.</p>\n<p><strong>LeBron and the Playoffs         </strong></p>\n<p>The last time LeBron James didn’t make the playoffs was 2005. Just for points of reference, I had just started kindergarten and the first iPhone came out in 2007. We’ve come to just expect LeBron to be in the playoffs, partly because of his transcendent talent and partly because of his residence in the inferior Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Moving to the Lakers has made the inevitability of seeing LeBron in the playoffs thrown into question. LeBron’s signing of a four-year deal signaled that he thought championship aspirations were not feasible this year, but the playoffs are a different story. In order to get into the playoffs, we can look at the bottom of the Western Conference and go from there. The Timberwolves made it last year, but with all the Jimmy Butler drama, I wouldn’t be surprised in the least if they take a fall in the wins column this year. That really leaves the Nuggets and the Spurs for the Lakers to overcome in order to clinch a playoff berth.</p>\n<p>Even though the Nuggets are good and only getting better with a young core centered around savant Nikola Jokic, and even though the Spurs have not missed the playoffs since before the turn of the century, it still feels like something has to give. If I had to take a guess, the Nuggets are probably going to be moved down a spot. The Spurs got the seventh seed last year with Kawhi not playing, which makes the addition of DeMar DeRozan a huge improvement. Even with the Lakers’ young core and a veteran group that feels like it would be more at home in a comedy than on a basketball court, expect to see LeBron in the playoffs this year.</p>\n<p><em>A

about?</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Personally, for me, it was a lot more competitive and provided a lot more opportunities than I originally thought. I came from baseball, and I realized that ultimate frisbee gives you the opportunity to make big plays, like laying out or jumping over people (which we call skying).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: I guess the sport has a big stigma when it comes to the word frisbee in general. You don’t really think of it as a serious sport, you think of it as being in the park or on the beach, but like Arthur said, when you get to college, you see all the intricacies that do come with it, like defenses, or zone or specific skill sets that each player has.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What are some myths about ultimate that you guys would like to dispel? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: I think most people find it super nerdy or hippie, or casual, but in the college level it’s pretty competitive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>When do most people tend to join the team?</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Well, I would say most people join it their freshman year, yeah.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: I definitely agree with that, but we also get some later years. Whether people hear from their friends or they come in and transfer, we do get some kids who come in after their freshman year, but the majority are definitely freshmen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cool. So</strong><strong>, on more of a long term note, what do you think was your favorite part of Black Tide, or the thing you’ll look back on 10 years from now? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Ooh tough question.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: Well, going back to your last question, it’s really cool how you’re able to incorporate all these people from different sports, because very rarely are you able to get someone who played frisbee all through high school. For the most part, it’s a team with people who have played soccer, football, golf, baseball, volleyball, tennis, really just a huge variety of sports. You formulate the team and each player can incorporate their previous experience into a role on a team. I would say that’s one of my favorite parts of Ultimate Frisbee.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: I would say that for me, when I look back, I’m going to look back at all my teammates. Me and Bailey are both graduating this spring, and there’s been a lot of college defining moments with frisbee. I feel like I’ve really grown up with my class rookies, and I learned how to balance a workload with school and practice and hanging out with everybody. Just the whole experience of the team and even beyond the sport itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>So how often does the team practice? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: We practice two days a week on the field and two days of lifting, and then during season, we’ll typically have a tournament on the weekends.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>So is there anything that you guys would like to say about Black Tide in general? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Well, I don’t know if you know about the alumni network, but Black Tide was one of the earliest ultimate teams in the nation. We’re tied for the most national championships and as far as connections go you get to meet alumni dating back to 1984, and even in Regionals, we met Tom Kennedy, the founder of Black Tide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What sports tend to translate well into frisbee? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: Well, I would say sports that test your agility, like football, soccer, so sports like that translate well into defense. Really, the biggest transition for freshmen is learning how to throw the frisbee and throw it with polish and precision. But then you also have guys like baseball players that have an advantage in terms of throwing, since their arms tend to start off a little bit better, so they might have an advantage to start. But sports like volleyball and basketball help too with verticality, and really a lot of different skill sets can work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What types of positions are there in ultimate? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: The most generic is the handler and the cutter, which if you break that down is similar to a quarterback and wide receiver, where the handler is touching the disc a lot. He has more polish with his throws, while a cutter, his main job is to catch the disc, whether that be with his verticality, something we call his radius of catchability, or just juking out the defender very often. So yeah, in very broad terms those two tend to be the general positions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What would you guys tell people who were thinking about trying out next year? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Arthur:  Well, I would say if you’re unsure, just come out, because for most people, college ultimate is not what their image of it is like at first, whether they played in high school or not. Almost everyone I have talked to has said it’s more competitive than they thought.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bailey: Yeah, I would agree with that. College is all about finding your fit, your group of people. Our team is really diverse, and not just in the sense of diversity, ethnicity or culture, but in our majors, and it can just be more than frisbee. It’s honestly a family. People have gotten jobs through Black Tide, because you really do meet so many different people and you form such deep connections. It really is like a family.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What do you guys think your best traditions are? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AP: Well I would say one of our best are Black Tide Pride, and honestly, I love our jerseys. I think they’re the best in regionals. We have really cool tie dye jerseys, and those date back to the very beginning of our program.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AK:I would say one that’s been really important to me is BFTB, or “Black Tide for the Boys.” Another great one is “Black Tide Never Dies.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: Oh, and a goofy one we sometimes say in games are “ooze, gush, stick, crush.” I still don’t know what that really means.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AK: Well, our team name refers back to the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara, so that’s what the ooze gush part is referring back to, and the stick crush part is about sticky defense, and we want to crush the other team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BW: So right before kickoff, one side will say “ooze, gush,” and the other will say “stick, crush,” just to give that sense of unity, and really showing the people on the field that they have 14 teammates who have their back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What’s been </strong><strong>the most memorable part of being on the team? </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AW: Well, at the end of my freshman year, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a 19-centimeter tumor in my left hip, and I had to do 11 months of chemo. So I went back home, and I was inpatient, which meant I was in the hospital every week. So for me, this team is always for the boys, and that means something to me. In my year off, I still had people driving down to L.A., since I was at UCLA, every few months to check up on me and hang out with me. So for someone who had to leave school for a while, it’s really hard, because all of my friends from high school were at college, and all of my friends at college were obviously at college, so I was alone with my family, so it meant a lot to me to have people drive down. I was just a rookie at the time, and I still had seniors, I still had fifth-year seniors, sophomores, freshmen, just everyone wanted to check up on me. That was the reason [why] when I came back that it didn’t matter the rehab I had to do, it didn’t matter that I couldn’t run the full length of the field without throwing up, because I knew I had to come back to this team. I hadn’t met these people before, like Arthur and Bailey, but it didn’t matter, because I was Black Tide. They were Black Tide, and that means that we’re family.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>After the interview with Black Tide, I’m starting to get why people on the team have such a feverish devotion. More than most clubs, the family bonds are really there, and they all seem to really enjoy each other. This was a great experience, and go Black Tide. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>After losing the first game by two in an exciting 13-11 loss, the Gauchos seemed lost out on the field in the last two games. They seemed to let the 9-3 loss yesterday affect their play, as they came out of the gates Sunday seemingly unprepared to face a newly confident Highlander team.</p>\n<p>Right off the bat, the Gauchos seemed to be outmatched. After the Gauchos only got one hit in the first inning, the Highlanders came out ready to swing, getting three hits, one short of UCSB’s total on the day.</p>\n<p>The three hits helped bring in a run, and Hannah Rodriquez also came home off of a wild pitch. After a second inning where the Highlanders scored two runs off of a double by Hannah Rodriquez double, the Gauchos were still within striking distance. However, the Highlanders put the game away in the bottom of the third.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With the Gauchos still scoreless, the Highlanders started to roll, and circled through their whole rotation while also bringing in 6 runs. From there, both sides seemed to sense the inevitability of the contest, and two innings later, it was over.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders were buoyed by their starting pitcher Taylor Misfeldt, who allowed only 4 hits on her way to earn her 17th win on the season, the most on her team.</p>\n<p>On the Gaucho side, sophomore Felisha Noriega took the start for the day. Unfortunately, she didn’t get very far, letting up 4 runs in the first and second inning, and was relieved by junior Veronika Gulvin. With this loss, Felisha dropped below .500, going 6-7 on the year.</p>\n<p>The substitutions didn’t fare much better, as both Veronika and her replacement, senior Lena Mayer, let up 5 runs. Veronika was pulled during the third inning, after her fifth run came in on a wild pitch.</p>\n<p>With Lena now pitching in the bottom of the third, she let up a wild pitch, which brought in a run, but was able to end the inning. However, she let up an additional four more runs in the fourth inning, and with head coach Brie Galicinao electing not to put in any more pitchers, Lena ended the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, there weren’t many bright spots for the Gauchos. One of the lone positives for the Gauchos was sophomore infielder Genesis Ramirez, who continued to swing well, getting two hits. However, with 6 of her Gaucho teammates going hitless, the offense was absent.</p>\n<p>For the Highlanders, no one individual stood out, but the team as a whole hit well. Three people had two hit games, and four people had two runs. Danielle Ortega did seem to shine brightest amongst the stars, with a triple in the third inning that cleared three runs in and seemed to seal the game. The Highlanders were simply much more potent on offense, and the Gauchos did not seem to have an answer.</p>\n<p>Ending the series on a 14-0 loss, the Gauchos hope to recover against Cal Poly this weekend, where they play a Mustangs team that is 8-10 in conference play and coming off a Cal State Fullerton win. The Mustangs should get some confidence from that, considering that was only Fullerton’s second loss of Big West play.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly comes to UCSB this weekend, with the first game on Friday, and the doubleheader on Saturday. This will be the Gauchos last series of the year, and we’ll see if they can go out on a good note.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82950\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82950\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/","id":28,"author":{"id":258,"name":"Andrew Strauss"},"related":[27,26,25],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/258"}},"__N_SSG":true}
