Courtesy of A.S. Student Body, the film was screened in I.V. Theater to students who could not wait for its set release date of June 19. Directed by Rick Famuyiwa, “DOPE” tells the story of high school senior Malcolm and his friends as they carefully survive tough lives in Inglewood, CA while balancing college applications, academic interviews and the SAT.</p>\n<p>A contender for this generation’s version of cult-classic “Friday,” but with the aesthetic of “House Party,” “DOPE” kept a sense of realism in its characters who are set up against a ludicrous backdrop. Unlike many other “black” films, “DOPE” uses modern comedic elements by using memes, social media and potty humor. Typically, this would carry a negative connotation, but in the case of this movie it is excellently executed and the pace is so quick that you don’t even care how juvenile it is. The film did not lose the opportunity to play into the irony that was the mainly white audience watching this “contemporary hood narrative.”</p>\n<p>The narrator (voiced by co-producer Forest Whitaker) explains how Malcolm and his friends are different from other kids in Inglewood because they are into “white shit,” including “classic ’90s hip-hop culture, BMX biking, getting good grades and miscellaneous geek fixations.” This gets them constantly bullied by the gangs and drug dealers in their neighborhood, especially Dom (A$AP Rocky) who later invites them to his party. Lured in by the prospect of “expanding their horizons” and the enticement of Malcolm’s love interest (Zoë Kravitz), the unlikely trio are thrown into a gritty adventure filled with tits, drugs and bitcoins.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This skuzzy Los Angles odyssey is a dynamic hybrid with a Quentin Tarantino pace and a John Hughes structure all fused within a “Do the Right Thing” vibe. The film provides a contemporary examination of South Los Angeles, racial identity and societal perception all within the metaphor of a Louis Vuitton bag. The film’s complex argument is that it’s not pinning gangster against geek – it is against society itself. As the film closes, Malcolm’s final monologue comes in the form of his Harvard admission essay on racial identity and inequality.</p>\n<p>The film’s distinctive eye-catching cinematography was amplified by its use of traditional split-screen technique and freeze-frames, further abetted by colorful design contributions. The offbeat ensemble, drawn from comedians and rappers to models and “lobby boys” (a reference to “Grand Budapest Hotel”), brought to life the film’s characters and overall spirit. All this set to the sick soundtrack created by Pharrell, who produced and wrote most of the music for the film, had the audience jiving in their seats.</p>\n<p>Famuyawa’s film was a breath of fresh air with its all-colored cast and eccentricities that reach out to modern, contemporary audiences. The ultimate wish of turning from major geek to major badass is subverted into these underrepresented teens that media has often said is unworthy of our time. This unifying message truly allows the film to live up to its name, my final review being: it was pretty DOPE.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62869\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/selling-dope-straight-out-of-sundance-modern-day-teen-odyssey-makes-its-way-to-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62869\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/selling-dope-straight-out-of-sundance-modern-day-teen-odyssey-makes-its-way-to-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/selling-dope-straight-out-of-sundance-modern-day-teen-odyssey-makes-its-way-to-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/selling-dope-straight-out-of-sundance-modern-day-teen-odyssey-makes-its-way-to-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/selling-dope-straight-out-of-sundance-modern-day-teen-odyssey-makes-its-way-to-ucsb/","id":5945,"author":{"id":751,"name":"Chinelo Ufondu"},"related":[5944,5943,5942],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Zion I Shares Wisdom and Feel-Good Music with Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Zion-I.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Zion-I.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Johnny Cash’s infamous middle-finger photo covered the wall of Velvet Jones, alongside other posters of historical performances.

On Friday, Feb. 13, another show went down in history at the esteemed venue: the second stop of the Rapture tour, the world tour of Oakland hip-hop duo Zion I. Those that took the stage with the literal dynamic duo included other NorCal artists Kev Choice, Dame the Drummer, Los Rakas, Locksmith and a special appearance by J. Lately.</p>\n<p>The very first opener, Chuck D., began his set on a sentimental note by playing “Amazing Grace” in dedication to friends who passed away recently and helped him achieve two years of sobriety. When the song concluded, he surged into his performance with a personality that filled the lackluster crowd. Chuck D. kept everyone entertained with references to hip-hop greats like Biggie, Kendrick and Eminem, and also asked what was going down on Valentine’s Day. Many in the audience chanted “Fuck it,” to which Chuck D. simply laughed and replied, “You’re all my Valentines.” Afterward, he gave a shout out to Nutella “because it’s fucking delicious.” Yes, it is, Chuck D., yes it is.</p>\n<p>The next performer, going by the name J. Lately, quickly segued into his performance. The man-bunned rapper took the stage with hypnotic beats and clever lyrics. The Berkley-native has established himself with three EPs featuring his classic boom-bap style and laidback flow. J. Lately’s unique ability to put everyday life into a relatable perspective allowed him to connect with those at the Velvet Jones.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Next was Richmond-based rapper Locksmith, a familiar face who I happened to run into while walking along State Street.

For him, drive comes from love for the art, and Locksmith counts his blessings to come to peace.</p>\n<p>The second song was inspired by his experience with sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>“Though I was scared as I wrote the song being able to put it out there, I felt liberated,” Locksmith said in an interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em>. “The thing is also not everyone has access to a platform such as mine, but number one thing to do is speak.”</p>\n<p>In response to the recurrent sexual assaults that occur here at UCSB, the seasoned rapper jokingly, but with an earnest air, curtly replied, “Transfer to Berkeley.”</p>\n<p>Finally Zion I took that stage, placing the crowd into another state of being. After opening with “Juggernaut” off their latest EP, <em>The Sun Moon and Stars</em>, the duo threw it back to their earlier days with “Coastin” and “Trippin.” Powerful stage presence and electro-bass elements gave the audience a unique hip-hop experience.</p>\n<p>The Zion I movement is purely “soulful, feel-good, uplifting shit,” according to frontman Baba Zumbi. The idea of feel-good shit could be clearly seen during the performance when a fight broke out in the crowd. Mid-song, Zumbi shouted, “Let’s all keep it unified and harmonious.”</p>\n<p>Zumbi kept this same mentality in one of their latest collaborations for the song “Unity,” a song in response to the violence in Ferguson.</p>\n<p>“I could easily rap ‘fuck them, fuck the establishment’ but you cannot conquer hate with more hate. Love will always conquer hate,” Zumbi said in an interview after the show.</p>\n<p>The seasoned rapper was humbled by all the UCSB students that came out that night.</p>\n<p>“I find [the student attendance] truly a blessing. Most of the people that listened to us in the beginning have family now, so they can’t come out to shows. But, I mean, the people in the crowd were born when we first started putting shit out and I truly thank them for supporting us,” Zumbi said.</p>\n<p>Zumbi ended the conversation with advice for the younger generation.</p>\n<p>“Read between the lines and follow your heart. Like my grandpa told me, ‘always make plans for yourself or someone will make it for you.’” And with that wisdom, the Velvet Jones garnered another bit of priceless history.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJY8E7CdmKI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/zion-i-shares-wisdom-and-feel-good-music-with-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/zion-i-shares-wisdom-and-feel-good-music-with-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/zion-i-shares-wisdom-and-feel-good-music-with-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/zion-i-shares-wisdom-and-feel-good-music-with-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/zion-i-shares-wisdom-and-feel-good-music-with-velvet-jones/","id":7752,"author":{"id":751,"name":"Chinelo Ufondu"},"related":[7751,7750,7749],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Catalyst’ Hits Stride in Launch Party","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Greeted by a refreshing, chilly night, hundreds of students and locals gathered in the parking lot of the Isla Vista Food Co-op last December during dead week.

The normally asphalt wasteland was transformed into a luminescent, mystical wonderland complete with glowing triangular sculptures, an artisan village and an abundance of holiday lights. The evening launched issue three of the student-run, literary arts magazine <i>The Catalyst</i>.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Re-started in April 2013 by fourth-year English major Natalie O’Brien, <i>The Catalyst</i> is a publication that grew out of UCSB’s English department created by the students, run by the students and made for the students. The first issue, released in January 2014, consisted of 80 pages of original student art and writing. Now, after months of planning and preparation, <i>The Catalyst </i>returned with a launch party to celebrate the release of their third issue, which can be found at the media racks in the I.V. Food Co-op or in the English department.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">An artisan village took over the grocery store’s patio, and local craftspeople sold everything from handmade bohemian wear to tie-dye tapestries. Onstage, students recited spoken word, poetry and short stories from the issue.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Third-year global studies student Hope Curran, who has participated with <i>The Catalyst</i> previously, showcased her simplistic, nature-based photography at one of the booths. Her inspiration derives from rich spiritual beliefs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I believe we are created to create, to savor the moment that God has created for us,” Curran said. “The co-op is the epicenter of a huge community founded on expression and it really takes one back to their roots.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Many artists were showcased in the event’s art walk, which stretched through the walkway to the I.V. Food Co-op doors. Senior Deanna Kim and juniors Corinna Zanolini, Ginger Quinta and Collette McGarrity were a few of the artists, and they brought their own share onto the standing easels and wire racks. One piece that really stood out was the fluorescent wooden-glass, quasi-teepee installation built by UCSB graduates Dominic Moretto and Mark Hoke. The three structures were spaces “where people would be able to get away and recharge.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While attendees recharged in these “pyramids of life,” others headed to the dance floor to get down to local bands The Crash Landings, Sun Daes, Hēlo, Hail Adventurer!, DJ Jones and DJ Ho, and the highly improvised performance of The Abortions, who albeit lacking a key member, were able to capture the praise of the crowd.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The space between each set was filled with students reciting poems aloud to the attentive audience. Powerful spoken word poetry was delivered by five students, ranging from fifth-year Erzsebet Vincent’s agony of forgetting about that “one person” to junior Dylan Ginoza’s experience as a gay Boy Scout appropriately coined “an illegal eagle.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Students also read parts of poems and prose published in <i>The Catalyst</i>. One such participant was freshman philosophy major Sam Arrow, who wrote the piece “Yelling Voices.” Arrow described <i>The Catalyst</i> as “the creative [outlet] I had been looking for. I have Natalie to thank for that. I randomly met her in a coffee shop and after having a meaningful conversation she convinced me to submit my work.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The creative outlet Arrow described is the very thing Editor-in-Chief O’Brien had hoped <i>The Catalyst</i> would serve as.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There have always been people wanting to participate [in UCSB’s artistic community], and now that we have solidified our repertoire with a growing group of individuals, events like this are able to happen,” O’Brien said. According to her, the purpose of the magazine is to “bring together people at UCSB in addition to bringing together different types of media in a collaborative effort,” which was exactly what was happening at <i>The Catalyst</i>’s showcase.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The magazine has big plans for future events, including a film festival. “A film festival has been in the talk since the release of our first issue, and if our team grows with more like-minded ambitious members, this could hopefully happen spring quarter,” O’Brien said, the glow from the launch party sparkling in her eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With these prospects in mind, one must think of the ways in which the UCSB community can keep this literary magazine alive, so that it does not fizzle out as it had seven years previously. The answer to this is securing enough dedicated members who are passionate enough to hold several fundraisers for the magazine. The whole project is all volunteer power since <i>The Catalyst</i> request for a lock-in fee was denied in the Associated Student election last spring.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This, however, does not discourage O’Brien, who is going to request another lock-in fee spring quarter.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“My favorite thing is being able to help people break out of their shells and find their voice,” O’Brien said, energetically waving her hand at the event that had been in the works for months. “With no funding there is no <i>Catalyst</i> and co-community. So go and write the poem that crossed your mind in your 8 a.m., go paint the way you felt about your breakup, come and join <i>The Catalyst</i> class for Winter Quarter (Interdisciplinary 185CW), because we won’t stop throwing events like this. <i>The Catalyst</i> has brought together the artistic community on campus and in I.V. and hopefully it’s not going anywhere soon.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To get involved in <i>The Catalyst</i> or to submit to the magazine, visit <i>thecatalystucsb.com/.</i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59521\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/catalyst-hits-stride-in-launch-party/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59521\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/catalyst-hits-stride-in-launch-party/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/catalyst-hits-stride-in-launch-party/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/catalyst-hits-stride-in-launch-party/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/catalyst-hits-stride-in-launch-party/","id":7721,"author":{"id":751,"name":"Chinelo Ufondu"},"related":[7720,7719,7718],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Black Scholars Hall Reviews K-pop","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“K-what?

Wait what did you say? Are black people even allowed to listen to that?” These were the frequent responses I got when I asked my hallmates in the black scholars hall about their knowledge of K-pop. K-pop (an abbreviation of Korean pop or Korean popular music) is a music genre consisting of electronic, hip-hop, pop, rock and R&amp;B music, which has its origins in South Korea. To the untrained eye, K-pop may appear as a fantastical music genre filled with bright colors, energetic dances and the biggest turnoff for most people: no English.</p>\n<p>Today, K-pop has become a “browser-hold” name through the power of social media and the insane popularity of Psy’s “Gangnam Style” garnering over a billion views on YouTube. With its ever-growing popularity a part of the “Hallyu-wave” in Korea, the influence of K-pop has spread out of the small country and found a strong audience in places such as other Asian countries, South America, Europe and even the United States. Though the spread of K-pop is commendable, the general audience still consists mainly of people of Asian descent, with some Caucasians and a growing number of African-Americans.</p>\n<p>For most African-American fans of K-pop, the genre’s hip-hop influences act as a gateway drug. K-pop fans that want to expose the genre to their friends typically introduce them to Korean hip-hop-influenced groups. With beats that resemble American hip-hop, the only hurdle for possible converts is the unfamiliar language. Of course, this does not apply to everyone. I sat down a few of my hallmates and showed them music videos that fit the Korean hip-hop fusion subgenre. On the wonderful panel of first-years, we had political science major Bakari Ziegler, film and media studies major Starr Sanford, anthropology major Kennedy Reason and biology majors Nicole Smovzh and Daionna Murray.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/wq7ftOZBy0Eframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/wq7ftOZBy0E\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>Rather than dipping one toe at a time with the first video, we plunged headfirst with what would be considered the epitome of the K-pop genre with the famed group Girls’ Generation and their hit single “I Got A Boy.” Predominately electronic-inspired, the song contains elements of both hip-hop and rap, with the group switching between song and rap. With this music video, I was met with comments like “Why are there so many colors?” and “They all look the same.”</p>\n<p>The video involves all nine members — yes, nine girls — putting on their cutest acts to impress a boy, while at the same time cutting to an aggressive and confident hip-hop inspired dance routine.</p>\n<p>“I like the dancing since it’s not the same thing throughout the video. Usually artists bring the same thing, like Beyoncé, but this offers a greater medley of things to see with each part,” Sanford said.</p>\n<p>A common female opinion was that these singers were rugged and tough when they were with each other, but as Smovzh observed, “As soon as a boy entered, they acted like basic bitches. That’s not cute. That’s not endearing. That’s ridiculous and just a dumb message to get across.”</p>\n<p>The next video was met with less groans and more interest on the girls’ part with the music video for “Growl” by EXO, the K-pop industry’s hottest newcomers. If the large band member number in the last video shocked my hallmates, nothing prepared them for the twelve boys that appeared on screen for this video. However, this video gray-scale edits starkly contrasted with the bright color scheme in “I Got A Boy”. My hallmates said that this allowed them to focus more on the music and the “amazing dancing.” Throughout the one-shot video, all twelve members exhibited their chorographical prowess, showing a mastery of intense moves as well as keeping a cool demeanor in the nonstop video. Again, this different form of performance was notable to Reason and Murray, who expressed that “they’re like One Direction, wait no, One Direction can’t dance” and “I have no clue what they’re saying, but, damn, they can dance.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/I3dezFzsNssframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/I3dezFzsNss\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>The last video received the most scrutiny and biggest reaction from my hallmates for the fact that this video drew the most influence from African-American hip-hop culture. The video for Taeyang’s song “Ringa Linga” features the singer clad in baggy pants, grills and faux cornrows while dancing and “spitting mad Korean bars.” To be clear, hip-hop music and culture have become an influential force all across the globe; Korean pop stars are hardly the only ones copying it.</p>\n<p>However, Ziegler, the only male that participated, argued “a K-pop star wanting to rap or dance like African-American artists is problematic because there isn’t a genuine desire to connect with black culture. Though they embrace this culture — our culture — their lyrics don’t mirror the culture of oppression and hardships.” And for this reason, the appropriation of black culture and all of western culture itself has become one of the main criticisms of the genre.</p>\n<p>Questions remain regarding K-pop’s potential for growth and influence. Will the scene be able to generate artists for the ages similar to the Beatles and Michael Jackson, who both moved from being teen idols to timeless international artists? Or will they continue to mimic their own superficial idea of western artists? While that remains to be seen, K-pop artists are certainly reaping the benefits of the genre’s current success. As for the black scholars hall’s unanimous final opinion, “the genre has room to grow, but has potential. They are all great performers, but they must find their own sound that others will strive to imitate.” Thus, in the black scholars hall, the budding genre has come a long way from being known as just “K-what.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/UJfZ69MSlvYframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UJfZ69MSlvY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58728\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58728\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/","id":7028,"author":{"id":751,"name":"Chinelo Ufondu"},"related":[7027,7026,7025],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/751"}},"__N_SSG":true}
