Gulvin earned her 16th win of the season with the victory, a mark that has her ranked second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB junior outfielder Jessica Johnston was the catalyst for much of the Gauchos’ offensive success. A third-inning single into center field put the Gauchos on the board, scoring fellow outfielder and senior Jacqueline Hinojosa, who had reached first on a bunt single earlier in the frame.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_76991\" style=\"width: 347px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76991\" data-attachment-id=\"76991\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-17/ucsb-pitches-two-shutouts-to-execute-series-win-over-csun/veronica-gulvin-winds-up-for-a-pitch-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Softball_vsUCR-170409-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Veronica Gulvin winds up for a pitch.

CSUN knocked her around in this one, accumulating 10 hits, six runs (four earned), two walks and two home runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got on the board in the bottom half of the first, as Altmeyer batted in Clark for the second-straight game, this time with a rocket double down the left-field line.</p>\n<p>A third-inning home run from freshman infielder Jessica Alexander swung the tide for the Matadors with the two-run shot that scored senior outfielder Taylor Glover (OF). Glover kept the momentum going in the fifth inning, scoring senior infielder Tara Kliebenstein on a sac fly to center field before Alexander smashed her second homer of the afternoon over the left-field fence.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had plenty more chances to score but were unable to capitalize on them, leaving four runners on base over the rest of the game. A pair of runs in the top of the seventh put the game out of reach for UCSB, evening the series at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Ashley Wright pitched a complete game shutout in Sunday’s second game, leading to a 4-0 Gaucho win that saw UCSB shutout the Matadors for the second time in the series. Pofek experienced her second loss of the weekend, as the top of the UCSB lineup was able to take advantage of the opportunities she provided once again.</p>\n<p>After yet another hit from Altmeyer, a first-inning single to center that brought home Clark on an error, Johnston gave the Gauchos a firm foot to stand on with a three-run shot to right field in the third inning.</p>\n<p>Wright carried UCSB the rest of the way, allowing only three more hits from the fourth inning onward and achieving her second credited win of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now stand at 24-20 on the season (.545 winning percentage) and hold a 5-4 conference record. The two wins mark their 11th and 12th home victories on the year, a much more comfortable place for the team to play, as away games have not gone so well (3-7 record).</p>\n<p>Johnston and Altmeyer continue to provide the Gauchos with scorching hot hitting, the former slashing .363/.400/.564 with four homers, 20 RBI and 12 doubles and the latter having hit a staggering nine home runs, 30 RBI and 10 doubles, all while drawing 21 walks and slashing .406/.490/.727.</p>\n<p>With those two leading the charge on offense and Gulvin (159 innings pitched, 12 complete games, 2.73 ERA) and Wright (2.72 ERA) holding it down for the Gauchos on the mound, UCSB has a clear path ahead to a very successful 2017 campaign.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play next against Fresno State in a one-game series at UCSB at 3 p.m. Wednesday, April 19.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With Diaz on second and Clark on third, sophomore second baseman Sierra Altmeyer reached on a fielders choice as Clark was thrown down at home.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With two outs and their backs up against the wall, redshirt freshman Whitney Pemberton singled, first scoring Diaz, then Altmeyer on a throwing error by Pioneer junior centerfielder Lauren Delgadillo.</p>\n<p>Those two runs proved to be all the Gauchos would need, as Sacred Heart couldn’t muster much offense for the rest of the contest. They scored a run in the fifth after two doubles and a RBI single from Delgadillo, but sophomore starting pitcher Veronika Gulvin was fantastic for the Gauchos, throwing all seven innings and pushing her record to 7-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB bumped its record over .500 for the first time this season in Saturday’s next victory, this time over George Washington. Their seventh-straight win, the Gauchos wouldn’t need much scoring in this one either with pitchers freshman Felisha Noriega and junior Lena Mayer handling the Colonials with ease.</p>\n<p>Diaz was again at the center of the action for the Gauchos in the fourth, starting off the inning with a double to right center. Senior outfielder Stacy Cavazos would enter as a pinch runner and advance to third during the next at-bat, on an Altmeyer single into left field.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer advanced on a ground out from Pemberton, and the Gauchos then followed that sequence with more error luck. After a single from sophomore shortstop Melanie Menor hit home Cavazos and got Altmeyer to third, Menor advanced to second on another throwing error by freshman left fielder Jessica Linquist.</p>\n<p>Senior third baseman Emily Brucelas then hit home Altmeyer and advanced Menor on an infield single before pinch hitting junior infielder Samantha Lujan shot one to center field, scoring Menor from third. The mid-game outpouring would again be sufficient for the Gauchos, as Noriega would allow the team’s only run, notching her second win of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next game against San Diego on Sunday would prove more difficult than the weekend’s first two contests, though the Gauchos still collected their third win of the weekend 7-4. After taking a 2-1 lead in the fifth, a high-scoring sixth inning would tantalize those in attendance.</p>\n<p>Two singles to start the inning from sophomore left fielder Taylor Spence and junior right fielder Kailey Hill opened the floodgates for the Toreros. They capitalized later in the inning with back-to-back, two-out doubles, one off the bat of freshman shortstop Sara Silveyra, followed by one from freshman catcher Madison Casiano, scoring all Spence, Silveyra, and freshman outfielder Savannah Shields, who pinch ran for Hill.</p>\n<p>Gulvin would get the Gauchos out of the inning, setting up a wild bottom of the sixth. Junior center fielder Jessica Johnston came ready to play, slamming a triple down the first base line to open the frame. Diaz was next up, hitting Johnston home on a sacrifice fly to left.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer continued her hot streak, doubling to right center field, and scoring two batters later on a single from Lujan. With the game now tied 4-4, Menor singled to left, advancing Lujan to second. After a series of substitutions from both teams, pinch hitting freshman infielder Genesis Ramirez loaded the bases on an infield single to the shortstop, Silveyra.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then rallied off three quick runs, the first on a bases-loaded walk, the second again on an infield single to the shortstop and the third on yet another infield single, this time to the pitcher. Senior right fielder Jacqueline Hinojosa, senior left fielder Kristen Clark, and Johnston were responsible for the three RBI (Johnston got her second at bat of the inning).</p>\n<p>Gulvin was credited with the victory, moving to 8-4, and Noriega’s one inning of work earned her the first save of her season.</p>\n<p>Northern Colorado defeated the Gauchos twice Monday, 6-5 the first game and 7-1 in the second, dropping their record to 12-12 overall. The decisive inning in the former was the top of the fifth, in which sophomore third baseman Jordyn Wiatrak hit a grand slam after senior shortstop Erica Dick knocked in two batters on a double to left center.</p>\n<p>The first loss was credited to Gulvin, while Noriega would collect the second. After drawing initial blood in the bottom of the first with a sacrifice fly from Altmeyer that scored Menor, the Gauchos would allow seven-straight runs, never showing much promise for the rest of the afternoon.</p>\n<p>UCSB should absolutely be happy with the weekend, however, as the season starts anew, so to speak, with the Gauchos heading into the rest of the season 12-12. Next up for Santa Barbara will be Oklahoma and Loyola Marymount on Thursday, Mar. 16, with the latter hosting in Los Angeles.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

USD will have already played Northern Colorado, UCSB’s final opponent for the weekend, earlier Sunday morning, giving the Gauchos an edge in terms of rested legs.</p>\n<p>The offense has been up and down for San Diego, though sophomores Taylor Spence (outfielder) and Lauren Kane (corner infielder) have supplied the team with consistent options atop the lineup.</p>\n<p>Spence is slashing .381/.447/.429, followed closely by Kane whose line stands at .375/.432/.525. The two have combined for nine RBI, six doubles, eight walks and 12 runs, and Kane has even gotten herself a triple in the season’s early going.</p>\n<p>Senior righty Megan Sabbatini leads the team with 47.2 innings pitched, more than double Lauren Berriatua (senior) who has the team’s second most. She’s been shaky in all those innings, however, racking up a 5.73 ERA, 3-6 record, allowing 10 home runs and a .333 opponent batting average.</p>\n<p>UCSB ends the Classic with a doubleheader against a less than formidable opponent in Northern Colorado, losers of three straight, on Monday, March 13, with the back-to-back games starting at 1 p.m. The Bears come into this matchup with only a 5-14 overall record thus far.</p>\n<p>The Bears again receive their main hitting contributions from the dynamic duo of senior Erica Dick (infielder) and sophomore Jordyn Wiatrack (catcher/infielder).</p>\n<p>Dick has slashed .333/.394/.550 with three homers, three other extra-base hits, and eight RBI, while Wiatrack has crushed four home runs of her own, a team high, and leads the squad with 12 RBI and 36 total bases.</p>\n<p>Senior Jayme Reddacliff is the only consistent option for the Bears on the mound, already having thrown for an eye-popping 63.1 innings on the season. Her 5.12 ERA and .306 opponent batting average are red flags, though, especially when juxtaposed with her 4-8 record. Northern Colorado figures to provide the Gauchos with an easier opponent to conclude their first weekend of home games in 2017.</p>\n<p>UCSB showed a continued ability to win close games this past weekend with four of their wins coming by fewer than three runs. Though the strategy is not a statistically sustainable one, the grit of this Gaucho team does not go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer is up to four home runs, three doubles and 11 RBI on the season, and freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz and junior outfielder Jessica Johnston are both up to two home runs and 11 and 7 RBI respectively. The power hitting is starting to come around for a Gaucho team that was in desperate need of deep ball hitters.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Veronika Gulvin was able to up her record to 6-4 over this past weekend and get her ERA below four (it now stands at 3.82).</p>\n<p>Freshman Felisha Noriega (1-4, 7.81 ERA) is still a questionable option behind her, but Gulvin has begun to prove that she is the ace this team was pining for.</p>\n<p>After catching their first wave of consistent winning play this season in Utah last weekend, the Gauchos will try to continue the trend back in sunny Santa Barbara at their first hosted tournament of the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts the Gaucho Classic I beginning at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 11, at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76325\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76325\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-aims-to-extend-five-game-win-streak-hosts-gaucho-classic-i/","id":43,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[42,41,40],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Softball Hoping To Shake Latest Slump at St. George Red Desert Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-19-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-19-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently on a two-game winning streak, UCSB softball is in a must-win situation at 4-10 heading into the weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Five games stand before the 4-10 UCSB softball team this weekend in Cedar City, Utah at the St. George Red Desert Classic.

Her partner in the infield, freshman Alyssa Diaz, will also be important to the Gauchos’ success this weekend, with two home runs and the same nine RBI in her first 14 games of college softball.</p>\n<p>The biggest test in Cedar City will be whether or not the Gaucho pitchers can come around after a rough start to 2017. Sophomore Veronika Gulvin and freshman Felisha Noriega have been the team’s stalwarts, but both have struggled mightily. Gulvin has three of the team’s four wins, and she holds the better ERA, but both have four losses, and “better” doesn’t necessarily mean good, with Gulvin’s ERA sitting at 4.56 and Noriega’s at 8.24.</p>\n<p>For the Wolverines, senior outfielder Courtney Beavers has been the team’s most impressive hitter, slashing .571/.625/.786, with three doubles, three runs scored and 11 total bases, all of which pace the team. Senior middle infielder Brittney Vansway has had a hand in much of the team’s production, knocking seven RBI in the season’s first four games.</p>\n<p>Junior Lauren Frailey leads the team with nine and a third innings pitched, and she has only allowed eight hits and two earned runs over that span. Senior Bailey Moore is close on her tail with eight innings thrown, and her 3.50 ERA isn’t too shabby either, suggesting the Gauchos will face a tougher path than the Wolverine’s 0-4 record would indicate.</p>\n<p>Iowa State (7-7) has been a streaky team to start the season, sweeping the Tennessee State Tournament the weekend of Feb. 17 before failing to win a game in the following weekend’s slate.</p>\n<p>Led by freshman infielder Sami Williams and junior outfielder Kelsey McFarland, the Cyclones pack an impressive punch offensively. Williams has slashed .300/.349/.625 to start the year, but somehow is being outdone by McFarland, who’s put up a .463/.521/.610 line.</p>\n<p>While Williams has the edge in RBI and home runs (11 to nine and three to one, respectively), McFarland gains her advantage having drawn three more walks, accumulated seven more hits and scored two more runs.</p>\n<p>The team boasts three impressive pitchers, all with ERA at or below 3.26. Sophomore Savannah Sanders is by far the team’s most relied-upon arm, as she’s thrown almost double the innings of her teammates (43) and appeared in 12 of Iowa State’s 14 games.</p>\n<p>Saturday will pit the Gauchos against the 8-5 Nevada Wolf Pack and the dynamic corner infield duo of sophomore Alyssa Mendez at third base and junior Jennifer Purcell at first. It’s been a hot start to the season for both, who’ve put up staggering hitting numbers as well as holding down the infield defense.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Kali Sargent and senior McKenna Isenberg head the pitching rotation, and the Gauchos will have to work their way around the two savvy, veteran throwers, who’ve accounted for the vast majority of the team’s innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The afternoon opponent for UCSB on the 4th will be Southern Utah, a 1-7 team that has failed to score more than three runs in all but one game. Five of the Thunderbirds’ games saw the team score one or zero runs, good news for a Gauchos pitching staff which struggled at the season’s onset.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Sarah Murphy is the team’s leading hitter with a .385 average, but her identical slugging percentage shows just how little extra base hitting she’s been able to provide the team. Sophomore utility player Kendall Kapitzke has the team’s one home run, and her .176 batting average is propped up by a .462 OBP.</p>\n<p>The Thunderbirds have tried several pitchers this season, but senior Kristen Hostetler has been the most relied upon, throwing in four games, starting a team-high three and doubling second place on her team with 16.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final match of the weekend will have the Gauchos face a Nebraska-Omaha team they were able to overcome 4-3 in extra innings at Stanford on Feb. 19. Since that game, the Mavericks have hit a losing streak, dropping four of their following five games.</p>\n<p>The lineup, which has been remarkably consistent with eight players starting and playing in all 13 of the Mavericks games, is led by two stud outfielders junior Kelly Pattison and senior Lia Mancuso. The former has a slash line of .359/.419/.615, three home runs, eight RBI and seven runs scored, while the latter has almost been her match, slashing .351/.400/.541, batting in four runs, taking one ball deep and collecting four doubles.</p>\n<p>Pitching has been more of a struggle for Nebraska-Omaha, with neither sophomore Laura Roecker nor senior Abbie Clanton, the team’s two main pitchers, having winning records or earning run averages below 4.00.</p>\n<p>Keys to the weekend will be the Gauchos’ ability to keep the game close, as they’ve had a penchant for getting blown out in games they lose. Furthermore, if the ‘Chos are able to get the bats firing and they can get up at least four or five runs per game, the pitching staff should be able to hold it down from there.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76103\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76103\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/","id":41,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[40,39,38],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Nab Just One Win At Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Matched up with a difficult slate of opponents over the weekend, the UCSB softball team didn't have much to celebrate while on the road.

Veronika Gulvin started and went the full six innings for UCSB, a decent effort for the sophomore who surrendered four earned runs and finished with a hefty WHIP of 2.00.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Oklahoma Head Coach Kenny Gajewski took out his sophomore starting pitcher Barbie Biggerstaff midway through the first frame, replacing her with junior Whitney Whitehorn, who would go on to toss four-and-a-third scoreless innings.</p>\n<p>After a pair of walks in the top of the fourth, the Gauchos were able to break a 2-2 tie during an odd sequence of events that included freshman infielder Kayla Krantz striking out, freshman catcher Kaitlin Barry getting thrown out at second base and Genesis Ramirez, another freshman infielder, still coming in to score from third.</p>\n<p>Two runs on a trio of Cowboy singles was the nail in the coffin for UCSB. However, as freshman Logan Simunek — who relieved Whitehorn in the sixth inning — forced a ground out, pop out and strike out to end what would be the Gauchos’ closest loss of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Freshman Felisha Noriega took the mound to face the Volunteers Thursday night, and though she was able to accomplish the second complete game by a Gaucho pitcher on the day, her eight runs allowed (six earned) — especially the final five, which all came in the fourth inning or later — proved to be all Tennessee needed to pull out an 8-3 victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz was the star of the game for the Gauchos, going 2-3 with all three of UCSB’s RBI, including a first-inning, two-run blast over the left field wall. Tennessee’s junior shortstop Meghan Gregg was there to outdo her, though, batting 2-4 with a home run, double and four RBI on the evening.</p>\n<p>Tennessee sophomore Matty Moss improved her record to 6-0 on the season (half of the Volunteers’ wins after Thursday’s contest), throwing all seven innings, striking out 10 batters and allowing only five hits and no walks.</p>\n<p>UCSB played another tough one against Purdue Friday, in which a neck-and-neck game was blown open in the top of the fifth with a flurry of Boilermaker scores. The four-run outbreak, centered on a bases-loaded double by junior catcher Kaylah Hampton, all but guaranteed the Gauchos’ third loss to start the weekend.</p>\n<p>The Boilermakers’ inferior record (this victory was only their second of the season), made this loss particularly painful for the Gauchos, especially since their bats were just beginning to come to life.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer rocked a second-inning solo home run, while Diaz was able to accumulate a double and an RBI for the second-straight game. Junior right fielder Jessica Johnston also grabbed a double of her own, and redshirt freshman Whitney Pemberton hit home a baserunner for only the fourth time this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finally got a positive result Saturday night, earning victory in a miraculous, comeback fashion. Down three entering the seventh and final inning, two of the first three Gaucho batters were retired on infield groundouts, but senior outfielder Stacy Cavazos was able to make her way on base after being hit by a pitch.</p>\n<p>With two outs on the scoreboard, the magic began. Jessica Johnston singled, advancing Cavazos to third, and after a ball hit to left field by Diaz, both went on to score on an error by sophomore Raime Cohen, who’d just subbed in to begin the inning.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer came to the plate with the Gauchos down two and Diaz on second base. With the game on the line, she crushed a pitch from sophomore Danielle Baumgartner into the left-field bleachers, finally assuring the Gauchos their first victory of the weekend. The two-run shot was Altmeyer’s second of the day and third in the past two games, though surprisingly those are her only three of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB lost in five innings in both of its Sunday matchups, falling 10-2 to the Washington Huskies and 8-0 to the Arizona State Sun Devils.</p>\n<p>Noriega couldn’t make it through the first inning of the Washington game, forcing the Gauchos to look past Noriega and Gulvin to freshman Lilliana Rodriguez and junior Lena Mayer, UCSB’s two lightly used pitchers. The duo surrendered nine runs (eight earned) in just three and a third innings.</p>\n<p>Gulvin was back to start the Arizona State game, but after allowing a two-run home run and hitting a batter in the second frame, the ball was again handed to Noriega, who went on to let in five more runs. She finished the next three innings, but the Gauchos’ complete inability to generate any offense sealed their fate and concluded a disappointing weekend for UCSB.</p>\n<p>While there have been glimpses of power hitting, consistent play and strong pitching for the Gauchos, this team has a long way to go if they are to climb back to the .500 mark and make 2017 a winning season. The team cannot continue to allow opponents such drastic, early leads, and the lineup must start generating more extra-base hits.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hope March has clearer skies in store, and will begin their climb back to success against Utah Valley, Iowa State, Nevada, Southern Utah and Nebraska Omaha next weekend at the St. George Red Desert Classic.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76029\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76029\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/","id":1185,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1184,1183,1182],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Participate in Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-23-at-2.03.01-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-23-at-2.03.01-PM.png?resize=980%2C583&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will endure a challenging set of games this weekend as three of its five opponents are nationally ranked in the Top 25 of the NCAA rankings.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Another busy weekend is fast approaching for the UCSB softball squad as the team travels to Cathedral City, Calif., for the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic.

She, too, has six RBIs, combined with four runs scored and a team pacing five doubles.</p>\n<p>The Cowboys boast two pitchers with winning records, senior Brandi Needham and first-year Logan Simunek. Needham has thrown two complete games, both shutouts, and holds a 1.66 ERA to go with a 3-1 win-loss record. She’s up to 14 strikeouts in 25 and a third innings pitched so far, more than doubling her earned run total of six over that span.</p>\n<p>The younger Simunek has appeared in seven of the 10 Oklahoma State games this season, and though her 3.42 ERA and 2-1 record don’t quite live up to the potency of her ace partner, the first-year has certainly held down the fort during her 14 innings of work.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, neither pitcher has allowed opponents to hit over .273 so far in 2017, so the Gauchos will need to reverse that trend as OSU will likely be one of their easier opponents at the tournament.</p>\n<p>Tennessee, the Gauchos’ next opponent in Thursday’s doubleheader, will enter Cathedral City undefeated. Coming off two straight shellackings in which they put up 14 runs on Oregon State and nine runs on New Mexico State, all while allowing no runs of their own, the Volunteers will be thirsty for blood and looking to improve their national rank against what appears to be an inferior UCSB opponent.</p>\n<p>The Volunteers boast several players with the potential to hit for power, most notably thus far being junior infielder Meghan Gregg and sophomore catcher and infielder Abby Lockman.</p>\n<p>Gregg leads the team with 18 RBIs, though Lockman is close on her tail with 13 of her own. They’re slugging an earth-shattering .964 and .842 respectively, the highest for players on the team who’ve participated in each of the Vols’ 10 games.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Gregg and Lockman are part of a three way tie for the team lead in home runs at two apiece, though they are just two of seven players to send one over the fence so far this season, emphasizing the penchant for offense on this Tennessee team.</p>\n<p>The Vols also rely on two workhorses within their pitching staff in sophomore Matty Moss and freshman Caylan Arnold. The two are responsible for nine of the team’s 10 wins, 49 of the team’s 57 innings and 53 of its 58 strikeouts. No one has been able to crack these two so far, though the Gauchos will take their shot Thursday.</p>\n<p>Purdue is UCSB’s only opponent on Friday, and their easiest one of the weekend. With only a 1-8 record, Purdue has lost four-straight games, including the final two only lasting five innings before ending due to the mercy rule.</p>\n<p>No one has hit a home run yet for the Boilermakers, and junior outfielder Maya Hughes, senior infielder Kristen Hoppman and sophomore utility player Mallory Baker are the only three batters approaching good seasons. Each holds a batting average over .260 — over .345 in the case of Hughes and Hoppman — and an on-base percentage over .345.</p>\n<p>Maddie Damon and Katie Johnson, a sophomore and senior respectively, have thrown the most innings on the team, just over 20 each, though Damon’s 1-1 record and 2.16 ERA is much more enticing compared to Johnson’s 0-5 mark and 9.33 ERA.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ second nationally ranked opponent of the weekend will be the Missouri Tigers.</p>\n<p>This matchup will be the first between the two programs and will feature freshman shortstop Braxton Burnside. She will try and extend her two-game streak with a home run, and improve her already stellar average of .318.</p>\n<p>Burnside will be joined by fellow first year, outfielder Cayla Kessinger, who after a rough start to the season, has torn it up in her last two games, collecting four hits in six at-bats, three runs, a homer and a double.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face two West Coast opponents on the final day of the tournament, starting Sunday against Washington and finishing it with Arizona State.</p>\n<p>Those who made the final decision in the scheduling of games certainly put the Gauchos’ greatest challenge at the end of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Washington has only one blemish on their roster, a 4-2 loss to BYU (now ranked No. 23), and has won its last six games, most recently an 8-0 shutout of the CSUN Matadors.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Taran Alvelo got the win in the contest, driving her record to 5-0, and junior Casey Stengel was able to keep her power streak alive, blasting one over the fence for the second game in a row.</p>\n<p>ASU is led by senior shortstop Chelsea Gonzales, the power hitting machine who’s slashed .538/.559/.885 in 10 games this season. Over that span, the Sun Devils have held a 9-1 record, due directly to the 14 hits, four doubles, one triple, one home run, 10 RBI and 23 total bases achieved by Gonzales.</p>\n<p>She’s propped up by a swell pitching staff, where each of the four dealers have at least two wins and an ERA no higher than 2.10. Junior Breanna Macha has thrown the most innings with 26, though first-year Giselle “G” Juarez and junior Dale Ryndak are the team’s strikeout queens with over 20 apiece.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still led by senior outfielder Kristen Clark in the lineup, holding a .519 average and .563 OBP, to go with 14 hits, two doubles and four RBI (Clark was finally able to draw a couple walks last weekend which had been a problem for her early in the season).</p>\n<p>Sierra Altmeyer, the sophomore infielder for the Gauchos, is third on the team with 12 total bases and is slashing a solid .333/.448/.500 in 2017, giving the Gauchos a glimmer of hope looking forward on offense.</p>\n<p>UCSB will still rely heavily on sophomore Veronika Gulvin and first-year Felisha Noriega, as both pitchers have crossed the 20-inning threshold on the season. Gulvin has her ERA down to 4.20, but Noriega’s 9.48 mark, combined with the atrocious ERA of the two pitchers behind them, is certainly cause for concern if the Gauchos’ two aces can’t handle the entire load this weekend.</p>\n<p>The action all begins Thursday at noon against Oklahoma State, and rounds out the evening of Sunday, Feb. 26, with Arizona State at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/","id":1186,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1185,1184,1183],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Back On Road Following Subpar Season Opening Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Following its underwhelming start to the season, the UCSB softball team will be back in action this weekend in hopes of reaching the .500 or above mark as it will face Nebraska-Omaha, Pacific, and Fre...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Looking to improve after a disappointing season opening weekend, the UCSB softball team will face Nebraska-Omaha, Pacific and Stanford in Palo Alto at the Stanford Nike Invitational.</p>\n<p>Action begins on Friday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. when the Gauchos play Nebraska-Omaha.

She leads the team in each of those categories except for runs batted in, where redshirt freshman infielder Vicky Kinney edges her with five.</p>\n<p>Kinney has 10 total bases of her own, accompanied by two home runs and a .714 slugging percentage. Along with senior infielder Nicole Warren (.385/.529/.692), Kinney and Klosterman are catalysts for most of Omaha’s scoring.</p>\n<p>Holding down the mound, the duo of sophomore Laura Roecker and senior Abbie Clanton are the two main pitchers for the Mavs, though each hold earned run averages over five.<br>\nRoecker has thrown in every one of Omaha’s games this season, and opponents have batted .368 against her to this point.</p>\n<p>Clanton is better in that respect, allowing a .260 batting average, but she has yet to notch a win so far this season — something Roecker accomplished on the team’s opening day.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks’ shaky pitching allows the Gauchos a valuable opportunity, one they’ll have to maximize in both games against Omaha Friday as well as at their matchup the following afternoon.</p>\n<p>Capping off UCSB’s doubleheader on Friday will be its matchup against Pacific, whom the Gauchos will play again Saturday. After losing its two opening games, Pacific owns a three-game win streak in which it has allowed only one run.</p>\n<p>The lineup is centered on a pair of senior utility players: Haylee Moran-Rowen and Cassidy Gustafson. Moran-Rowen leads the team with a .467 average, although her inability to draw a walk this season suggests her offensive production will trend downwards from here forward.</p>\n<p>Gustafson leads the team with two home runs and three runs scored; she has also contributed four RBI. She has struck out three times — tied for the squad’s most — and similarly to Moran-Rowen, she has troublingly not been walked in the season’s first five games.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Pacific has a deeper pitching rotation than Omaha and UCSB with sophomore Kenya Lindstrom and freshman Hailey Reed, who have pitched three innings each to provide solid options behind the team’s main arms, junior Marissa Young and Cassidy Gustafson. Young and Gustafson have each thrown double-digit innings in 2017 and will be the main scouting targets for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Lindstrom has been responsible for both of the team’s losses, and her 16.80 ERA is even more eye-popping when compared to the other three pitchers, all of whom have earned run averages below one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try to force Pacific to utilize her this weekend, hoping to make hay as other teams have been able to twice this season.</p>\n<p>Stanford, who opened up its season with six games in Arizona, was racing to a 4-0 record before losing its last two games against San Diego and Fresno State, the latter a 24-8 beat down.</p>\n<p>The Cardinal is led on offense by the scorching play of freshman catcher Teaghan Cowles, who possesses a .520 hitting clip, .556 OBP and .600 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, senior infielder Kylie Sorenson owns current .400 batting, .448 OBP and .560 slugging averages. The trend of hitting continues with redshirt sophomore utility player Whitney Burks, whose stats are .360 batting, .448 OBP and .680 slugging percentages.</p>\n<p>All have at least 12 total bases and seven runs batted in (Burks leads the bunch with 11 RBI), and Cowles is the only one without a home run, though she does have a slightly rarer triple.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Carolyn Lee is Stanford’s best pitcher, holding a 1.00 ERA and 3-1 record, with two complete games, 10 strikeouts and an opponent batting average of only .228.</p>\n<p>She and freshman Nikki Bauer have combined for over 39 of the team’s 47 innings pitched, and Santa Barbara will likely see at least one of the two on Sunday.</p>\n<p>If the bats come out in full effect at Stanford and the pitchers are able to avoid the early deficits that plagued this team last week, the Gauchos should be able to rebound from their early woes.</p>\n<p>If returning to California brings no reward, however, UCSB will have dug itself into quite a hole to start the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Nebraska-Omaha Friday, Feb. 17, at 2:30 p.m. It will play Pacific later that day at 4:45 p.m. Another contest against Pacific will take place Saturday, Feb. 18, at 10 a.m., while it will face Nebraska-Omaha again at 2:30 p.m. Santa Barbara will end its weekend after its noon bout against Stanford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75777\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75777\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/","id":1182,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1181,1180,1179],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggle Mightily at Houston Hilton Plaza Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-17-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-17-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB had a tough opening weekend after dropping four of their five opening matches to start the season with a 1-4 record.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After the New England Patriots were able to ride a wave of good fortune for Feb. 5’s Super Bowl, there was hope some of their luck might remain in the city for the UCSB softball team in the Houston Hilton Plaza Invitational a week later.

Gulvin then hit sophomore middle infielder Laurie Derrico and after a fly out from Paige Luellen senior first baseman Macklin Hitz rocketed one over the left field fence, bumping the lead to 5-0.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Felisha Noriega replaced Gulvin at that point, finishing out the next two-and-two-thirds innings. She allowed one run in the sixth; Spring was again involved in the action. She singled to center field, knocking home sophomore utility Mauriana Jamele, who had reached to start the inning on an error by UCSB senior infielder Emily Brucelas at third base.</p>\n<p>Wichita State senior pitcher Katie Malone went the distance, pitching all seven innings and allowing eight hits, one run, and one walk while striking out five. Senior outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa was able to get the Gauchos on the board in the fifth, singling with the bases loaded to score sophomore shortstop Melanie Menor from third, but that was the only run UCSB could muster.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s four errors were a deciding factor as the Shockers had only one more hit than the Gauchos, but they did not commit an error on the field all afternoon.</p>\n<p>The following game was over quickly as Houston took it to the Gauchos, scoring six runs in the bottom of the first inning. Loving their home field advantage, the Cougars hit through their entire lineup in the opening frame.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outfielder Elise LeBeouf singled to right field, scoring freshman utility Arielle James and advancing sophomore outfielder Maya Thomas to third, bringing up senior designated player Shelby Miller.</p>\n<p>Miller delivered, slamming a homer over the center field fence, pushing the lead to 4-0. Noriega entered her second-straight game, this time replacing junior starter Lena Mayer with only one out in the first.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Sarah Queen and redshirt sophomore infielder Sarah Barker were responsible for the next two runs batted in, ending the inning with six in total.</p>\n<p>LeBeouf collected two more RBI with a home run in the second inning and the Cougars again went off in the third with another five runs.</p>\n<p>Hinojosa and senior outfielder Kristen Clark accumulated the only two RBI for the Gauchos, with the former hitting in Menor for the second-straight game and the latter scoring junior outfielder Jessica Johnston on a sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>UCSB would go through two more pitchers in the game: freshman Lilliana Rodriguez and Gulvin for the second time Friday. Houston sophomore Presley Bell would pitch the second complete game against the Gauchos that day, though the Cougars would only need five innings; a 14-2 score was enough to end the game because of the mercy rule, a deficit of 10 runs after five innings.</p>\n<p>Noriega pitched in her third-straight game Saturday, starting the 9 a.m. match against Wichita State. Seeing Noriega for the second time in two days, the Shockers jumped all over her, scoring five runs in the second inning after earning one in the first.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman pinch hitter Whitney Pemberton was able to homer in the fifth inning for the Gauchos, scoring freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz from first. Diaz went on to earn a RBI in the sixth on a bases-loaded walk from senior pitcher Katie Malone, though the run would be credited to the freshman starter Bailey Klitzke.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos escaped with a 12-10 victory on Saturday, rallying to score four runs in the top of the seventh inning. Freshman infielder Kayla Krantz and junior outfielder Jessica Johnston hit home runs for Santa Barbara, going 2-3 with two runs, three RBI and a walk and 2-2 with two runs and one RBI, respectively.</p>\n<p>Lilliana Rodriguez got her first win of the season in the last one-and-two-thirds innings, giving up only one hit, albeit a two-run home run. Raider junior pitcher Ashley Sharp was credited with the loss, giving up five runs — four of them earned — in three-and-a-third inning of relief work.</p>\n<p>Boston College finished off the Gauchos’ weekend by again building up an early lead in the first three innings.</p>\n<p>Junior second baseman Chloe Sharabba homered over the left field fence, which was followed one out later by senior catcher Tatiana Cortez homering to left center. Junior designated player Jordan Chimento then blasted a home run down the left-field line, hitting in three runs to push the lead to 6-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB was only able to create two runs: sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer when Pemberton was caught stealing in the second and Clark on a wild pitch in the sixth.</p>\n<p>Junior Jessica Dreswick pitched yet another complete game against the Gauchos, and UCSB again relied on Noriega and Gulvin to gut through another seven innings. Santa Barbara’s lack of pitching depth was very apparent on the weekend and will certainly need to improve if the Gauchos are able to turn their season around after an early funk.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play Nebraska-Omaha, Pacific, and Stanford at the Stanford Nike Invitational next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Clark’s storied career at UCSB has been stunning to watch; after collecting Big West Freshman of the Year and First Team All-Big West honors in her first year, Clark achieved Second Team All-Big West her sophomore year, and she followed that up with another First Team appearance her junior year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Clark’s career slash line of .399/.446/.432 boggles the mind, and after hitting over .400 for the second time in three years, she became the first Gaucho to ever accomplish that feat in two separate seasons.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer also provides the Gauchos with some established returning talent. Altmeyer rocked seven home runs and 42 RBI, both top five marks in the conference, and she was selected to both the Big West All-Freshman Team and the Second Team All-Big West.</p>\n<p>With star pitcher Ashley Ludlow’s college career over, the Gauchos will look to sophomore Veronica Gulvin to fill her shoes. Gulvin tossed 113 innings in 2016, good for second-most on the team to Ludlow, and, despite her 8-12 record, a 3.52 ERA shows the youngster has some promise.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s duels with Boston College and Wright State will pit UCSB against two brand-new opponents in their history.</p>\n<p>BC is coming off a 30-23 season, and the team retained all its offensive starters except for two. Junior pitcher Jessica Dreswick is coming off a great season (14-8, 2.47 ERA), and she combines with fellow junior Allyson Frei (186 strikeouts in 2016) to form a dominant one-two punch for the Eagle pitching rotation. The Gauchos will likely have to face one, if not both pitchers this weekend, so the offense will have to be geared up and focused on winning the small battles they can.</p>\n<p>On offense, the Eagles rely on senior catcher and third baseman Tatiana Cortez. She crushed 13 home runs on a .380 batting average in 2016, easily earning her All-ACC First-Team honors. If the Gauchos can make sure she doesn’t get into a groove this weekend, they’ll have a much easier job of containing Boston College in their two matchups.</p>\n<p>Houston was also somewhat mediocre in 2016, assembling a 27-29 overall record. With only three returning seniors, the Cougars hope a dose of fresh blood will give the team new life in 2017.</p>\n<p>Three Cougars received All-American Athletic Conference selections in 2016: sophomore pitcher Savannah Heebner on the first team and sophomore outfielders Elise LeBeouf and Maya Thomas on the second. All three were also recognized on the All-Rookie team for the conference, giving Houston a remarkable young core in 2017 and beyond.</p>\n<p>For Wright State, the combination of junior outfielder Honnah Susor, senior catcher Vivi Marquez and redshirt senior shortstop Becka Peterson will make up the brunt of the offensive attack for the Raiders. Wright State was second in the Horizon League for its second season in a row last year, and the team is eager to get over the hump in 2017.</p>\n<p>Wichita State is led by a strong senior presence, the team boasts seven in total, and comes off a 2016 season in which it won both regular season and tournament championships. Senior catcher and first baseman Macklin Hitz and junior utility player Mackenzie Wright are on the preseason All-Missouri Valley Conference team, showing the potential for this Shockers squad.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s first opponent will be Boston College at 12 p.m. on Friday, followed by Houston at 5 p.m. Saturday will pit the Gauchos against Wright State at 9:30 a.m. and Wichita State at noon. Finally, the Gauchos will rematch BC on Sunday at 8 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75578\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75578\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/","id":1180,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1179,1178,1177],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Season in Review: Women’s Volleyball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-12-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_012-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_012-web.jpg?resize=480%2C600&ssl=1","description":"In a season that started with a promising beginning but experienced its inconsistencies, the UCSB women's volleyball team still managed to avenge last year's losing finish.

A win against the nationally ranked Hawaii Rainbow Wahine would have given UCSB an inside track to the playoffs, but the Gauchos weren’t able to overcome the Big West Champions, dashing their postseason hopes once and for all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB concluded its season against UC Irvine, but the group appeared depleted from the two previous devastating losses, never showing much fight and getting swept by the Anteaters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the Gauchos will fall short of their preseason playoff goals, the plethora of young talent on this UCSB team is unmistakable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a big group of returners which is certainly exciting for this group,” Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch, noted. “We have a group of young women that have high goals and aspirations for where they want to take this program.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First among those young women is redshirt first-year outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, who after putting up season averages of 4.09 kills per set, a .246 hitting percentage, 2.08 digs per set and 0.31 service aces per set, was named Big West Freshman of the Year. Ruddins also earned a spot on the All Big West First Team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She will play a pivotal role on the team moving forward, and the Gauchos will need Ruddins to build off her fantastic first year and continue developing into possibly the Big West’s most potent outside hitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lindsey was a big time point scorer for us this year,” Coach Lantagne Welch, said. “I can only see that [improving from here].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lantagne Welch continued, “[Lindsey] had one of her best matches at Hawaii against some of the top competition in the country. I know she can grow in certain areas, [such as] being really effective on back to back nights.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruddins success is exciting for the Gauchos’ future, as Coach Lantagne Welch explained how much room the redshirt first-year has to grow. “[Lindsey] has so much room to improve still. She started taking on a bigger roll passing towards the end of the year, and that’s something she’ll want to grow with and get better at, along with her defense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside Ruddins on the Big West All-Freshman team was fellow Gaucho freshman middle blocker/right side hitter Rowan Ennis, who started all nine conference matches and finished the Big West schedule with 2.29 kills per set on a .253 hitting percentage. She, too, will play a vital role in the Gauchos’ offense moving forward after showing that she was more than prepared for the collegiate stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite another season ending injury, junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman still received an Honorable Mention for the All-Conference team, and for now, she’ll enter next season as the only senior on the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Elizabeth Sheffield also received an Honorable Mention for the All-Conference team, a heart-warming development for the middle blocker who spent her first two collegiate seasons with the UCSB club program before joining the team last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have many other cornerstones to build upon for 2017. Sophomore Emilia Petrachi was the most productive libero in the conference, and redshirt freshamn Hannah Juley proved herself as a permanent option at the setter position for UCSB for the next three years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know our culture and team chemistry is excellent,” Lantagne Welch concluded. “We made a lot of strides in the right direction this year, and we gained a lot of experience. Now it’s just going to be using that experience to get better and grow as players.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end of the season begins the process for next year, as the Gauchos will look to build off their improvements this year to become one of the premier teams in the Big West in 2017.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74543\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74543\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-02/gauchos-season-in-review-womens-volleyball/","id":5003,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5002,5001,5000],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Unable to Overcome Slump, Swept in Season Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"An end to its five match winning streak last week signaled a downward shift in the UCSB women's basketball team's 2016 season as the Gauchos ended their season on a three-match losing streak after bei...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team concluded its season on the eve of Thanksgiving, losing its third straight match in a 3-0 sweep to UC Irvine.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65227\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65227\" data-attachment-id=\"65227\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-continues-to-struggle/emilia-petrachi-bump-sets-the-ball-to-her-teammate-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-20-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Emilia Petrachi bump-sets the ball to her teammate.

After playing to a 13-13 tie, two kills from redshirt junior middle blocker Danielle Geiger and an attack error from UCSB freshman outside hitter Chloe Allen gave Irvine a 16-13 lead.</p>\n<p>Though the Gauchos continued to battle, that distance proved sufficient for the Anteaters, who held the lead for the remainder of the set.</p>\n<p>UCSB was again able to keep it close through the beginning of the second frame, though the train went off the rails a bit earlier for the Gauchos in this one. After achieving a seven-point tie, UCSB lost the lead, never to gain it again, falling 19-25 to the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>The third set was the Gauchos’ best showing, as if they’d realized the end of their season was staring them directly in the face.</p>\n<p>Playing with an increased sense of urgency, the Gauchos were able to extend their close play with UC Irvine far past their earlier watermarks, even taking a 20-19 lead into the final stretch of the set. Two kills from sophomore opposite hitter Harlee Kekauoha and one from freshman outside hitter Loryn Carter gave the Anteaters the lead, however, and the Gauchos were unable to get it back, losing 25-23.</p>\n<p>A disappointing season’s end for the Gauchos, the team’s inconsistencies mounted after having successive blows dealt to their postseason chances over the past two matches. Losing to UC Riverside put the Gauchos on the outside looking in, and last Saturday’s loss to Hawaii relieved UCSB of all playoff hopes.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield was the only Gaucho to top double-digit kills in the match, finishing with an even 10 in the final exhibition of her career. Redshirt freshman outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins could only muster nine kills on 31 attempts, finishing with a .194 hitting percentage, far below her usual output.</p>\n<p>Sheffield’s fellow senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt finished with six kills on 11 attempts for the Gauchos, while Chloe Allen was able to add eight of her own. Redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley finished with 30 assists, right in line with her conference average of 10.21 per set.</p>\n<p>Juley was outpaced by UC Irvine senior setter Shelley Anderson, however, who finished with 37 assists on the night while also contributing eight digs over the three sets.</p>\n<p>Two Anteaters finished with at least 10 kills; Loryn Carter collected 11 and redshirt senior outside hitter Victoria Dennis racked up 10 of her own. Four other players finished with at least five kills, contributing to the all-around approach that caused the Gaucho’s demise on the evening.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi was her usual self for the Gauchos, finishing with 13 digs (4.33 per set), far outdoing the Anteaters’ junior libero Luna Tsujimoto, who reached only six.</p>\n<p>Though this was not the way the Gauchos wanted to end the season, the year was beyond a doubt a productive one. UCSB was able to establish itself as an up-and-coming young team, with several of its best players returning next season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-25/ucsb-unable-to-overcome-slump-swept-in-season-finale/","id":5002,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5001,5000,4999],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope To End Season On a High Note","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has improved mightily this season and even though there will be no NCAA appearance, it hopes to end the season with a win.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absent any postseason hope, the UCSB women’s volleyball team will aim to finish their conference schedule with a positive record Wednesday night in a home match against the UC Irvine Anteaters (11-18, 6-9 Big West).</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65793\" style=\"width: 295px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65793\" data-attachment-id=\"65793\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/elizabeth-sheffield-takes-a-swing-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Elizabeth Sheffield takes a swing.

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB accounted for the first of those three back on Nov. 5 in Irvine when the Gauchos were in the midst of their first substantial winning streak during the conference schedule. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redshirt senior outside hitter Victoria Dennis has been the most potent offensive force for the Anteaters, averaging 3.50 kills per set in Big West play, seventh in the conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She sports a solid .241 kill percentage and is one of 11 players to cross the 200-point threshold throughout the conference schedule, joined by her teammate, sophomore outside hitter Harlee Kekauoha. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another senior, setter Shelley Anderson, is responsible for creating opportunities for Dennis and her fellow outside and opposite hitters, averaging just under 10 assists per set during the Big West season, right behind Gaucho redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley’s 10.22 which rank fifth in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Anteaters, Kekauoha, who ranks second on her team in kills per set, also gives them an edge in the service game as she’s led All-Big West competition with .58 services aces per set. Junior libero Luna Tsujimoto is one of seven Big West players to average at least four digs per set in conference play; her mark of 4.28 per set is about a half dig shy of Gaucho sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi’s 4.71 league-leading number. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this will surely be UCSB’s final match of the year, there are still many bright spots in what was a vastly improved season for the Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lindsey Ruddins will wrap up a tremendously successful conference schedule in which she averaged 3.83 kills per set (fifth in the Big West), .56 service aces per set (second), 2.06 digs per set (28th) and 4.5 points per set (third). If she can top 20 kills in the contest, it would be her third time in four matches and fifth this season. After missing out on the 2015 season, Ruddins has proved to be every bit as good as billed in 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After transferring from Wisconsin, Hannah Juley, too, was an absolute standout for the Gauchos in 2016. Finishing with the fifth-most assists per set amongst her Big West competition, Juley hit her stride when the conference schedule started. Since then she’s accumulated five double-doubles, eight matches with at least 40 assists and two with at least 50. A key concern this season for the Gauchos was locking down the setter position, and Juley has left no question about the direction for the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB can also rest easy knowing it has possibly the Big West’s best libero in Petrachi. The sophomore from Modena, Italy leads the conference in digs per set and comes into the match with four straight 20-dig efforts after only five up to that point in the year. On the verge of completing her second season, Petrachi’s experience will be vital for the Gauchos going forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior middle blockers Elizabeth Sheffield and Phoebe Grunt will compete in their final match for UCSB Wednesday night, hoping to cap their careers with a victory. Grunt averaged career bests in kills per set with 1.95, and in hitting percentage with .355 in 2016, capping a stellar season despite playing in the fewest matches in her tenure with the Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her second year with the team, Sheffield improved her hitting percentage from .244 to .312, and her kills per set from 1.73 to 1.75. She’s gotten to at least 10 points in nine of her last 12 matches and will look to continue that trend in the last match of her collegiate career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With one match left in what has been a rollercoaster year, the Gauchos still have much to glean from the 2016 season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and UC Irvine face off in the final match of the season for both teams at 5 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 23,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at the Thunderdome. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/","id":5001,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5000,4999,4998],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Defeat in Final Road Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its last opportunity at a possible postseason birth, the UCSB women's volleyball team saw its NCAA Tournament hopes fizzle as it was unable to defeat No. 14 Hawaii.

Hawaii found an early lead behind two service aces from senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor, and was able to control the early portion of the set, eventually leading 17-11.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">A timeout from Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch would make all the difference, however, as the Gauchos would follow the stoppage with a 14-4 run to win the set.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The final push, an 8-1 drubbing of the Rainbow Wahine, was spearheaded by the service work of outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins; the redshirt freshman had two service aces over the stretch, as well as an assist to redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley, who would rack up assists of her own on half of UCSB’s final eight points.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Freshman outside hitter Chloe Allen would also collect three kills over the stretch, finishing with 10 in the match, good for second most on the Gauchos and her third-highest output for the season.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB played the Rainbow Wahine to a 6-3 advantage in the second set, a peak in the Gauchos’ hopes for the evening. An eight-point Hawaii run would follow, and UCSB never posed much of a threat for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The third frame saw a similar effort from the Gauchos to begin the set, but another devastating 10-2 Hawaii run midway through, pushing the lead to 20-13, was again UCSB’s downfall.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The Gauchos weren’t able to put up much of a fight in the fourth game, never holding a lead on the way to finishing with only 10 points</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB was held to hitting percentages of -.031, .159 and .000 in the final three sets, starkly contrasting with the .323, .304, and .400 marks achieved by the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Lindsey Ruddins was still very productive for the Gauchos, accumulating 21 kills, albeit on a whopping 68 attempts (.235 kill percentage), along with three service aces and six digs.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">She fell just short of Hawaii’s Nikki Taylor, who concluded Saturday’s match with a double-double on 22 kills (.405 kill percentage) and 11 digs, adding three service aces for good measure. Both were far more prolific than their averages, 4.59 kills per set for Taylor and 4.13 for Ruddins.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The difference in Saturday’s match was Taylor’s support compared to Ruddins’, as three other rainbow Wahine finished with at least eight kills, while only two other Gauchos were able to accomplish the feat. Furthermore, four Gauchos finished with negative hitting percentages, all of whom participated in at least three sets.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Freshman Rainbow Wahine setter Norene Iosia slightly outplayed UCSB’s Hannah Juley, finishing with 40 assists as opposed to Juley’s 34, and completing a double-double with 15 digs while Juley could only get to four of her own.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Emilia Petrachi, the sophomore who’s arguably the Big West’s best libero, paced all players by 10 digs with 25 on the night, though only one other Gaucho was able to top double-digit digs and three members of the Hawaii team were able to do so.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Hawaii will look to move up from their 14th position in the national rankings after sweeping its weekend contests against the Gauchos and the Cal Poly Mustangs.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB will have one opportunity to conclude their season on a high note despite the sting of missing out on the playoffs with a home match against UC Irvine on Wednesday, Nov. 23 at 5 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74381\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74381\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/","id":5000,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4999,4998,4997],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Pursuing NCAA Bid, Hopes To Upset No. 14 Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After suffering their first loss in the last five matches, the Gauchos will look to rebound by upsetting No. 14 Hawaii.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team is back on the road this weekend as the team heads to Hawaii to play the 14th- ranked team in the nation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a fun team to play,” Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch of the Hawaii squad, said. “I know we’ll be up and excited to play them.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine lead the conference with a 13-1conference record, 20-5 overall and hold a 1.5 game lead on the Long Beach State 49ers in the Big West standings.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Hawaii hasn’t lost since an overtime match with Long Beach State on Oct. 8, and it dominated the last match against UCSB in straight sets, 25-20, 25-14, 25-19. The Rainbow Wahine have only dropped one set since the LBSU match and have now swept seven straight league opponents, including that same 49ers team two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Rainbow Wahine senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor has been one of the league’s premier scorers this season, racking up 4 kills per set in conference play. She’s aided by sophomore outside hitter McKenna Granato and middle hitters senior Annie Mitchem and junior Emily Maglio, each of whom rank in the top 25 for kills per set against Big West competition with at least 2.20.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Maglio paces all players with a .409 kill percentage against conference competition, as she’s been good for 100 kills and only 17 errors over the span. Mitchem also ranks fourth with a .353 hitting percentage, completing what has been a ferociously efficient duo in the middle for Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Like the Gauchos, Hawaii also relies on first-year setter Norene Iosia.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team had a wrench thrown into their postseason plans this weekend as UC Riverside managed to spoil the Gauchos’ latest streak. The 3-2 victory earned the Highlanders the season sweep over UCSB after the Gauchos’ 3-1 win over Cal State Fullerton Friday night.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara concluded the weekend 17-10 overall and is now 8-6 in Big West play. The losing woes continued for the Titans, who are now 6-22, 1-13 after losses to UCSB and Cal Poly extended their losing streak to 13 matches. UCR ended its two-game skid with the victory over UCSB and currently sits at 8-18 and 3-11 in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB dropped its first match against the Highlanders on Oct. 14 in four sets, and Saturday’s rematch proved to be even more competitive with Riverside winning in a fifth set 23-25, 25-21, 9-25, 25-21, 15-11.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The disappointing outcome came on the heels of a fifth-straight victory for UCSB after defeating Cal State Fullerton. Cal State Fullerton proved to be a worthy opponent despite their 1-11 Big West record (6-20 overall) entering the match, outlasting the Gauchos 27-25 in the first set.</p>\n<p>UCSB was taking no part in a close contest for the rest of the match, however, as a 10-point run to start the second set led to the Gauchos holding the Titans under 18 in each of the final three games.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense was immaculate in those three sets, as Cal State Fullerton wasn’t able to hit above .185, plummeting in the third set with a -.077 kill percentage and seven errors. UCSB’s offense also steadily improved throughout the match, peaking in the final set when it hit .387 with only two errors.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins was in spectacular form throughout the evening, compiling 27 kills with only four errors, a .411 kill percentage and 15 digs, completing yet another double-double. A career-high in kills for the outside hitter, Ruddins also provided five service aces and was by far the most dominant player on the court.</p>\n<p>She was aided heavily by fellow redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley, who also contributed a double-double with 14 digs and a match-high 47 assists. Juley was also feeling it from the service line, joining Ruddins and redshirt sophomore Sydney Bast as the three Gaucho players with at least three aces.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi topped 20 digs for the second-straight match, finishing with 21 on the evening and providing the defensive spark that allowed the Gauchos to dominate after a shaky first set.</p>\n<p>Sophomores outside hitter Madeline Schneider, middle blocker Summer Kerins and outside hitter Shimen Fayad each had at least eight kills for the Titans, though Fayad was the only player to breach double-digits with 13.</p>\n<p>Fayad was able to notch a double-double as well with 11 digs, second most on the team to first-year defensive specialist Madisen Babich’s 16. Freshman setter Rachel Hall was also impressive throughout, her 37 assists good for just under 10 per set.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos riding a tremendous hot streak, heading into their match versus UC Riverside appeared an easy task for the ascending Gauchos as UCR is second to last in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>UCSB would take a close opening set 25-23, a late Riverside run giving the Gauchos their first scare of the night, as they had held the fellow UC at a comfortable distance for most of the game. The Highlanders controlled the second, though a late 7-2 run from the Gauchos, including two of first-year outside hitter Megan Rice’s eight kills, brought UCSB within two.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside had little trouble finishing the job, however, as two kills from junior middle blocker Meg Graham contributed to a comfortable second-set Highlander victory.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos seemed to turn the corner in the third, playing one of their best sets of the season on the way to a 25-9 win. UCSB hit .400 in the game, compared to a -.172 for the Highlanders, and forced 10 turnovers while limiting itself to only one.</p>\n<p>After gaining a 15-11 advantage in the fourth, a six-point Riverside run proved sufficient to force a fifth set. They carried their momentum into the tie-breaker, grabbing an early 9-5 lead before a quick four-point retort from the Gauchos locked the teams in yet another draw.</p>\n<p>A 6-2 run by the Highlanders clinched the match as the Gauchos fell just short and dropped to two games behind Cal Poly for third place in the conference.</p>\n<p>Emilia Petrachi again paced the Gauchos with 21 digs, her third-straight match with 20-plus. Lindsey Ruddins, Megan Rice, senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt, senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and first-year outside hitter Chloe Allen all had at least eight kills, though Allen’s hitting percentage of .242 was the highest of the bunch, as errors were a steady issue for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley had 47 digs for the second-straight match, eight more than UC Riverside’s sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle. Doyle completed a double-double with 14 digs, and was one of four Highlanders with at least 13.</p>\n<p>One of those four was senior outside hitter Cristina Maietta, whose 14 digs, 17 kills and two aces accounted for a large portion of her team’s production. Four UCR players also had at least 10 kills, including middle blockers Meg Graham and junior Brooke Callahan, as well as first-year outside hitter Mickayla Sherman.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ postseason hopes took a major hit this weekend, but the team will still try to finish the season on a positive note with its final two matches next week.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to Hawaii Saturday, Nov.13 for its second match against the Rainbow Wahine before hosting UC Irvine Wednesday, Nov. 23 for the final match of the 2016 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74177\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74177\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/","id":4995,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4994,4993,4992],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/292"}},"__N_SSG":true}
