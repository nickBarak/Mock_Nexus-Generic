She initially started the account, which boasts 55 followers, to showcase the training progress of her guide dog, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In high school, I was raising and training Lane to be a guide dog  and wanted to give people some insight as to what that process looked like,” Nelson explained. She said the account was “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for others and myself to document my journey with him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Olivia Chung, a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, saw her dog Oreo’s Instagram profile, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/oreothewirefox/\">@oreothewirefox</a>, as a unique way to bond with her wire hair fox terrier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We spend a lot of time together anyways, but we get to spend this time [taking] pictures, and it’s fun to think of creative pictures and different scenery,” Chung said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chung has maintained the profile for nearly four years and has amassed 65 followers so far. She said she uses the profile to “keep my pictures of him in one place and also share with my friends and family who haven’t gotten to see him in-person and who live far away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kat Williams, a fourth-year history of art and architecture major, began documenting her dogs, Boone and Ohana, as soon as she got them nine months ago. Williams said she was inspired to create <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/booneandohana/\">@booneandohana</a> because of her dogs’ cuteness and photogeneity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The job of running an Instagram dedicated to a pet may seem easy, but Williams said there’s always “the pressure for everything to look nice, have a defined ‘aesthetic’ and post frequently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While she has felt pressure to always have her phone out to take the ideal photo of Ohana, Williams said she has learned to “not agonize over every picture being perfect.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olivia Bernheimer, a fourth-year sociology major, has seen considerable growth on her cat Cleopatra’s Instagram, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cleothe_kitty/\">@cleothe_kitty</a>, over the last six months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She has over 100 followers, which is way more than I ever expected,” Bernheimer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After watching a documentary about the mysterious phenomenon of internet cat famedom, Bernheimer became acquainted with some of the most influential instagram cats, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@fatcathercules and @iamlilbub.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All this is very silly, but that is what makes it so fun,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While coming up with creative captions proves difficult at times, “seeing that people love my cat as much as me” makes all of the work worth it, Bernheimer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like to celebrate her. She brings so much to my life that I want to share it with the world.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But some pet owners are finding difficulty in sorting through all the pictures they take of their pets to find the perfect one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matthew Griffin, a fourth-year political science major and the owner of a golden retriever named Jeter, said that he sorts “through the thousands of pictures I have of Jeter in order to pick the best ones.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He initially made a profile for Jeter after seeing how friendly he was with his family, friends and people in the neighborhood. Griffin said Jeter’s Instagram profile, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jeter_thegoldenretriever/\">@jeter_thegoldenretriever</a>, was actually inspired by another pair of golden retrievers, Camper and Honey, whose owners operate the successful profile @camperandhoney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Samantha Stackelhouse, the owner of a long-haired teacup chihuahua named Max, was inspired to create Max’s Instagram after strangers came up and asked if Max had a profile online. After experiencing this time and time again, Stacklehouse took it upon herself to create an Instagram account for Max. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The account, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/max.the.fluffy.dog/\">@max.the.fluffy.dog</a>, has been active for four years, Stackelhouse said. The best part is “people seeing him in public and after meeting him, immediately following his Instagram,” she added. “It’s really cute to see how people react over him.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the account’s growth, Max’s Instagram profile hasn’t achieved the level of stardom that others have, but she still enjoys putting out photos for those close to her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Though [Max is] not Instagram famous, a lot of his followers consist of our family and extended friends,” Stacklehouse said. “I think people like to see a break in their feed of a really cute dog instead of social media drama or bad news.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94304\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94304\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/","id":1772,"author":{"id":19,"name":"Alexandra Leal Silva"},"related":[1771,1770,1769],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hooked on Hook & Press","category":"On the Menu","subcategory":"First Bites","publish_date":"2019-12-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_7487.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_7487.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A donut shop unlike any other in the area.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tucked away on State Street is a little “shop” known as Mosaic Locale.

Burnett officially opened Hook &amp; Press in October 2018 and since then, it has cultivated a strong fan base in SB, being known as the only shop that specializes in artisan donuts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the moment you walk in, the display case invites you to take in all the flavors and designs. The woman behind the counter informed me that H&amp;P changes their flavors every season and while a few are constant tenants, the rest rotate through. Behind her, there was a large chalkboard displaying their prices for a single donut ($3.50), a dozen donuts and the variety of coffees they sell. The display case held about six different flavors, with choices ranging from Horchata Crumb, P.O.G (Passionfruit, Orange, Guava), Pumpkin Spice Latte and a range of donut holes.

The donut itself was fluffy and felt light but was covered in a decadent frosting with lines of caramel and other chocolate sauces. As someone who had a deep chocolate craving that day, it satisfied me to my soul. The caramel was a bit sticky to hold but it was a small price to pay for indulgence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My partner, Sean, chose the Coastal Fog and was not disappointed. He remarked at how the flavor stayed steady but was never overpowering. He was kind enough to share with me and I liked how soft the flavor sat on my palate as opposed to the strong chocolatey flavors of the other. Sean spent much of his childhood in England and was able to confirm that it tasted like an authentic London Fog with an SB twist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, while it may not be the best choice to slide through every day, health-wise or budget-wise, these donuts are the perfect way to satisfy your cravings and indulge in pastry goodness. If you have friends or family visiting SB, I highly recommend this spot to make them wish they could come back sooner! </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-09/hooked-on-hook-press/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-09/hooked-on-hook-press/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-09/hooked-on-hook-press/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-09/hooked-on-hook-press/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-09/hooked-on-hook-press/","id":7898,"author":{"id":19,"name":"Alexandra Leal Silva"},"related":null,"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Real Talk Program Returns to Dorms for Second Year","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dorms_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dorms_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Real Talk program works toward creating spaces open for free-flowing discussions on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, race and gender.

While the Multicultural Awareness Program appointed coordinators in each residence hall to facilitate discussion programs, the Real Talk program will instead work toward creating spaces open for free-flowing discussions on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, race and gender, rather than keeping the focus on education-based programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duane “Deejay” Johnson, chair of the Real Talk program, explained that the Multicultural Awareness program was created in the 1980s, and in the past few years, staff noticed there was “lack of knowledge” regarding marginalized groups in the older program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, in 2019, people… have access to more knowledge surrounding race, sexuality, etc,” Johnson said. He added that Real Talk took inspiration from other programs such as Jada Pinkett Smith’s Red Table Talk, a Facebook Watch show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Johnson, the Real Talk program was established as a way for students to comfortably talk about different topics such as “race and [the] social norms of living in this society.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is designed to not ignore the educational component of teaching students in the residence halls about multiculturalism, but instead, give students the opportunity to talk about their own experiences, teach each other and create open dialogues surrounding different topics that affect all of our everyday lives,” James Forrester, a student leadership program advisor, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forrester views the Real Talk program as a chance for students to hold meaningful conversations that spark new perspectives “using key communication skills.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Assistant Resident Directors supervise each residence hall’s individual program and each have their own goals for it, according to Felipe Recinos Quant, Manzanita Village’s assistant resident director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My main goal is for RTs to become bigger in attendance. Of course, quality over quantity but I would love for discussions about social justice to continue to grow,” Recinos Quant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want there to continue to be a safe space available for the Manzi community to have discussions on social justice issues that are at times somewhat taboo to talk about.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first year of the Real Talk program was focused on tackling the “-isms” — such as racism, sexism and ableism, according to Johnson. But Johnson found that the program still felt constricting —  the point was for the conversations to be free-flowing. Now, facilitators are trained not to give their personal opinions, but instead to guide conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Real Talk has a motto: they do the before, during and the continuing. Before consists of checking themselves — are they able to deliver this, are they able to educate on this topic, do they hold personal biases?” Johnson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During the session [the facilitators] set ground rules and look for signs in the audience of anger, discomfort, frustration. The continuing involves continuously asking questions and reminding the group of the facts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facilitators are trained before beginning their programs and have separate planning sessions to research and plan for their upcoming Real Talks, according to Forrester. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though there are many components to this program and its predecessor, the overall intention remains the same, Johnson said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My hope is that students attend, engage — even with those who have different ideas in these spaces and talk these things out and hear these things out.

The Secretary of State will review each campus’s program every year to ensure that they are following the guidelines as laid out in the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara is well-known for its consistently high voter turnout — during the November 2016 election, UCSB and Isla Vista voter registration drives registered a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/over-13000-voters-registered-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record 13,000 new voters.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meg Winnett ‘19, who served as the UCweVOTE coordinator for the external vice president of statewide affairs office during the 2018-2019school year, was part of the effort to register students and maintain that high voter turnout level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last year, I observed that the nonpartisan status of UCweVOTE encouraged many students to be more comfortable talking and registering with me and our volunteers. At the time, however, we were so keen on the act of registering students to vote that it’s possible we overlooked the importance of the next step: strictly nonpartisan voter education,” Winnett said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know Campus Dems and College Republicans, as well as CALPIRG, helped out tremendously with distributing materials to the student body at large, and I’m thrilled that there will now be another outlet through which students can find reliable information.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has been a leader in student voter registration for decades because students have crafted a culture of civic engagement that is second to none,” Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited to see the passage of AB 963 because I see it as a step towards taking the model for voter registration that we have at UCSB statewide.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Students have the option of replacing one of the upper-division art history courses with a portfolio workshop course and a two-unit internship course, according to the minor sheet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The art history and architecture department already provides three academic options for students looking to pursue art-related endeavors: the core major, the core minor and a minor in museum studies, which was first offered to students in Fall Quarter 2018, according to Savannah Parison, the program advisor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The architecture and urban history minor will allow students with an interest in architecture to pursue an education in the field without having to fully dedicate themselves to the discipline, according to Parison.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The project has been in progress for two years with the aim being student enrollment in Fall [Quarter 2019],” Parison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The curriculum committee, who decided on the content of the new minor, included Professor Swati Chattopadhyay, Professor Claudia Moser and Department Chair Mark Meadow, all from the Department of History of Art &amp; Architecture. Although the program was just unveiled at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019, Parison said a couple of students have already come in to declare the minor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that the new minor is not exclusive to art history courses; it includes opportunities to take courses within both the geography and environmental studies majors. Both of the aforementioned disciplines offer classes that can be used to fill requirements of the minor, including the geography department’s series on urban or regional planning and the environmental department’s series on sustainable communities, according to Parison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She clarified that the minor would not solely focus on the classical world, but the architecture of multiple styles and time periods as well.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison has already noticed an interest in the minor across a variety of academic fields, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (S.T.E.M.)</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">majors that usually wouldn’t express interest in art history given the demands of their coursework.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had a lot of interest from engineering students in the past who want to be involved but can’t double major in two colleges but can do the minor relatively easy. It gives them a way to participate and we’ve received lots of support from the engineering departments and advisors,” Parison said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison advises students to meet with her before taking on the minor to determine if it will fulfill their needs and interests, or even if the major may potentially be suited for them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not a university that explicitly prepares students to be an architect and this minor is not the best way to qualify for architecture school. This is a minimal step and so discussions need to be had,” Parison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She emphasized that there are opportunities for students interested in a career in architecture, stating students should reach out to faculty member and permanent lecturer Jeremy White who regularly holds workshops on the subject matter. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Oct. 3, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-offers-new-minor-in-architecture-and-urban-history/","id":1964,"author":{"id":19,"name":"Alexandra Leal Silva"},"related":[1963,1962,1961],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/19"}},"__N_SSG":true}
