But has director Patty Jenkins been able to finally break the chain of critical flops, from that of “Batman v Superman” to that of “Suicide Squad?” Have our beloved childhood comic-book heroes finally been released from the poisonous grip of Zack Snyder? Well, it’s a bit difficult to say. For the most part the answer is yes; “Wonder Woman” is far from being a letdown. The film, which is at times incredible and at other times questionable, is more of a successful bunt than it is a home-run, with the folks at DC taking a very cautious and careful step forward toward critical redemption. The result is a well-executed yet formulaic film that abides by the many tired conventions of the comic book form, leaving little room for innovation and frustrating anyone looking for a fresh new take on the comic book genre. Still, for anyone looking for a fun, fast-paced action-adventure blockbuster, then this is exactly what you’ve been looking for. But for those of us who wish for something more from their comic-book films, you’ll be left wanting just a little bit more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1645836084\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78366\"><img data-attachment-id=\"78367\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=936%2C334&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"936,334\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"song\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=250%2C89&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=888%2C317&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78367\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=888%2C317\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=250%2C89&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=768%2C274&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The good news is that there are plenty of aspects to enjoy about the film. Each and every location and act, save the final CGI airfield mess, is incredibly entertaining, at least on a surface level. From the beautiful Amazonian home of Themyscira, which showcases some of the film’s more outlandish and entertaining sequences (when will you ever again get to watch Amazon warriors face off against villainous Germans?) to the solemn war-torn fields of the Eastern Front, the film has its fair share of exotic locales and engrossing scenarios.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The issue here is the film’s jittery pace, as it never wants to stand still and take a breather. Halfway through the movie you’ll feel like you’ve tasted 20 different flavors of drastically different films, but you’re never allowed to stay and watch any one of them long enough to be satisfied. Between action sequences that mirror the adventures of Indiana Jones and the London alleyways that echo political spy thrillers, the film can never seem to decide on which movie it wants to be. And that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because each small snippet of genre, from fantasy to war, is relatively well-done. But having less than five minutes of screen time designated to the trenches of World War I can leave some with an unquenched thirst. Regardless, between its various moments of exhilaration, the film does a more than satisfactory job of keeping your attention focused, even if it all just feels like it’s skimming the surface of something that could have been even more worthwhile.</p>\n<p>The best scenes of the film are those that take the time to slow down, and these scenes are mostly shared between Gal Gadot (Diana aka Wonder Woman) and Chris Pine (Steve Trevor) as they confront the moral complexities of war. The contrasting of Trevor’s first-hand understanding of the horrors of war with Diana’s naïve black-and-white morality brings out the much deeper themes that the film desperately needs. Pine’s monologues on the nature of war are especially moving. One of the best sequences I’ve ever seen in a comic-book film has the two leads dancing in a war-torn village as snow begins to fall. Diana asks Trevor what people do when there isn’t any war to fight. He responds that they eat breakfast, read the paper, get married and do other mundane things typical of a peaceful time. When she asks him what it’s like to do such things, he wearily responds, “I have no idea.” The war runs deep in these scenes and shapes our leads into better characters. It’s a shame that the film barely addresses these issues, as these dramatic and heart-breaking moments bring out the best in Gadot’s performance and showcases the best the film has to offer. Moments like these are lovingly crafted by Jenkins.</p>\n<p>With a rather large and diverse cast, “Wonder Woman” establishes many great characters, although they’re accompanied by a few unfortunate duds. The standout here is clearly Pine’s character of Steve Trevor. Pine is funny, charming, courageous and downright inspirational (and as my girlfriend pointed out, downright cute). I wouldn’t be surprised if Pine used this performance as his audition tape for the next Indiana Jones. The subtleness in his acting, alongside his ability to make even the most ridiculous of scenes seem plausible, allows Pine to ultimately steal the spotlight. While his role in the film is structurally set up to support the overall progression of Gadot’s character and narrative, the film is arguably just as much Trevor’s story as it is Wonder Woman’s, which may be a problem for some.</p>\n<p>Gadot’s Wonder Woman is the hardest character to evaluate. While she performs feats of incredible strength and frequently takes control of her own decisions, charging into battle to save the lives of those in need, the character is equally as often presented as a naïve and almost “ditsy” character. While this “fish-out-of-water” personality fits within the narrative and is quite charming to watch, it makes it hard to distinguish Gadot’s acting ability from the youthful naivety of her character. Paired with her accent, some lines come out as just sounding off.</p>\n<p>But for the most part, Gadot can hold more than her own. She’s brave, sweet and can even pull out a surprising dramatic flair in some of her more emotional scenes. Seeing the Wonder Woman character kick ass as her incredible theme song builds up around her is more than worth the ticket price, and anyone who isn’t giddy for at least a minute as she charges toward the trenches of war has lost a part of their childhood <em>wonder</em>. It goes without saying that Gadot is a new inspirational action hero, not just for a female audience but for the general public as well.</p>\n<p>The supporting cast varies in talent. Robin Wright, who plays Wonder Woman’s mentor, Antiope, is absolutely amazing. Her stern kindness and sly grin, flashing in the face of battle, make the short time spent with her character immensely enjoyable. David Thewlis is also as calming and talented as ever, even though his character sputters out in the last act. Eugene Brave Rock as the Chief, however, is shockingly terrible. There haven’t been too many performances that I have audibly laughed at before, and I can only suggest that aspiring actors use his performance as a case study for how not to act in a film. The villains, Danny</p>\n<p>Huston’s Ludendorff and Elena Anaya’s Dr. Maru, are disappointingly misused in the film. Ludendorff, while convincingly acted, is just another addition to the throwaway comic-book movie villain fodder, and together with Dr. Maru, the two act more like the laughable villains of a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon. It’s a shame, too, because Anaya’s Dr. Maru is absolutely chilling in her few brief appearances and could have made a memorable female supervillain if she hadn’t been ultimately cast aside for an unnecessary CGI slugfest.</p>\n<p>“Wonder Woman” is far from a bad film. There are barely any major issues outside of a forced third act and an annoying absence of development and quiet time for our characters. But an absence of glaring issues does not mean that the film is great, or even very good. The film at its best is a fun popcorn flick. Beyond its period setting, “Wonder Woman” isn’t very different from your run-of-the-mill comic book fare. The grouping up of our heroes to face off against an undeveloped super-baddie is just so overdone at this point that the outcome is exhausting. There’s nothing here that you haven’t seen before.</p>\n<p>In a sense, “Wonder Woman” has saved the DCEU for Warner Brothers, <em>with</em> its glowing praise and an enormous opening. But at what cost? The company’s answer to the scathing reviews and steep revenue drop-offs of its former DC films is in the form of a relatively safe and formulaic picture. While the film may surpass the quality of its predecessors and even overcome a few of the Marvel features, it nevertheless cripples itself to the expectations set by the typical comic book venture, forcing “Wonder Woman” to shy away from its more engrossing and deeper themes. Nearly a decade after Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight,” critics and audiences seem to have greatly lowered their expectations for what a comic book film could be. Even though “Wonder Woman” is far from being a bad film, passing up plenty of its comic contemporaries, we shouldn’t have to lower our standards for our childhood superheroes due to the genre’s often mediocre result. While “Wonder Woman” isn’t mediocre, it still isn’t great and holds on as tight as it possibly can to the prospect of being good. Still, the film is a step in the right direction, albeit a very cautious one.</p>\n<p>Despite all of this, “Wonder Woman” is still incredibly enjoyable to watch and is probably the best movie out right now. You can’t help but smile when her incredibly energetic theme song fills the theater.</p>\n<p>Yet, the most cynical of us will always wonder to ourselves what could have been.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Their chemistry dominated the theater, proving true the afternoon’s main ringing theme: collaboration crafts the best comedy.</p>\n<p>Louis-Dreyfus took the audience back to her being sold on the idea alone before there was even a script.</p>\n<p>“What appealed to me was the actual, very seemingly simple concept, which was a female vice president who’s profoundly unhappy.” She had done plenty of network television before and was ready to “shake it up” with a move to cable, and HBO provided a more than welcoming home. At HBO, “VEEP” is able to have freedom in the creative process that other networks would restrict.</p>\n<p>“With Dave at the helm, scripts are very well formed by the time we come to set,” said Louis-Dreyfus, beginning to describe the hectic creative process of “VEEP.” But once the scripts arrive, the scenes and dialogue often change and evolve on the day of shooting. The crew constantly works to, as Mandel puts it, “thicken the broth,” working through the scenes to find the right dialogue, delivery and pace to ultimately arrive at a polished scene and rhythm. This on-the-go molding applies to the general feel of the show as well.</p>\n<p>“Messiness is our bread and butter,” explained Mandel, describing the way in which the show strives for a grounding in reality. Nothing is perfectly enunciated or said, and every movement is far from perfectly performed. It’s what Louis-Dreyfus refers to as “jujjing” (the spelling of which I could never figure out), which is the practice of making a scene feel more real by appearing more messy.</p>\n<p>For Mandel, when “you have the outline right, the jokes can change,” but the overall story stays intact. While the specifics and details are often improvised and fleshed out in the moment, the production remains united in crafting these scenes from the writing to the acting all the way down to the editing, which Louis-Dreyfus and Mandel often work on themselves.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77572\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2044763747\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77571\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77572\" data-attachment-id=\"77572\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/veep_selina/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?fit=798%2C475&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"798,475\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Veep_Selina\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?fit=250%2C149&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?fit=798%2C475&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77572\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina-250x149.jpeg?resize=250%2C149\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?resize=250%2C149&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Veep_Selina.jpeg?w=798&amp;ssl=1 798w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77572\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Go Read a Book</p></div>\n<p>Just like with the unity of the production crew, the producers are equally adamant about keeping their audience together, being careful not to alienate any demographic based on political opinion. When confronted about the show’s role in addressing the overwhelmingly controversial presidency, Louis-Dreyfus stepped in to clarify the show’s authorial intent on such a divided political environment.</p>\n<p>“Our show is not, in fact, a parody; our show is a comedy about political culture,” stated Louis-Dreyfus.</p>\n<p>She pointed out that the show has never actually referenced a real political candidate since Ronald Reagan.</p>\n<p>“In our universe, the “VEEP” universe, the world shifted after Reagan,” and ever since then fictional candidates have stood in for real-life political parties Louis-Dreyfus continued. While she went on to note that parody shows like “Saturday Night Live” and “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” do “fabulous jobs” of parody, she reiterated that their objective at “VEEP” has never been to explicitly parody a real-life politician. The show is also careful to avoid identifying the political party of any character, and as a result, both Republicans and Democrats seem to “dig” the show. In fact, Louis-Dreyfus claimed to have met both conservative Republicans who believed “VEEP” was making fun of the Democrats and, inversely, liberal Democrats who believed “VEEP” was mocking conservative Republicans.</p>\n<p>So while the show is based in politics, it isn’t a clear political advocate for any particular viewpoint. Mandel further clarified that “VEEP” is ultimately a show about “wanting power” instead of some bold political analysis. However, Mandel still had a few quips to rattle off about the current political landscape, expressing his sympathy with the Trump Administration.</p>\n<p>When thinking through the stupidest thing a president could do for his own fictional Selina Meyer, or when brainstorming what the worst press conference should look like on his show, Mandel has to concede: He simply cannot compete with the Trump Administration. And while he has a “hard enough time doing 10 episodes,” he can’t even begin to imagine how hard the real-life White House must work to get through 100 real-world episodes of their own political nightmare.</p>\n<p>Overall, while those at “VEEP” may work to keep their real-world critiques absent from the show, in order to maintain an undivided audience, the real world political landscape is almost inevitably blending together with the best in comedy.</p>\n<p>“Script to Screen: VEEP” ended with an uproarious applause as the theater said goodbye to what may be the most impressive trio of comedians to have graced Pollock thus far. We can only hope that if they return, President Meyer will by then have done far worse than our own commander in chief.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77571\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77571\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/veep-provides-humorous-fresh-take-on-politics/","id":6109,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[6108,6107,6106],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Get Out’ Conveys a Message Within Horror","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The film always maintains a lighthearted and entertaining demeanor, but its acknowledgement of the issue of racial microaggression and even the principle of eugenics is something to stop and think abo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Get Out” served up the most fun that I’ve had at the movies in a very long time. Not only is it an incredibly tense, ridiculously funny and shockingly unnerving film, but it’s also an immersive thrill-ride. While the film is surprisingly impressive, it’s even more jaw-dropping when you consider that “Get Out” is Jordan Peele’s directorial debut. While Peele brings along his knack for humor, don’t be deceived; “Get Out” is intensely thrilling and insanely smart. It’s the rare film that’s a perfect mix of comedy and suspense, all the while remaining an absolute blast.</p>\n<p>When his girlfriend invites him to meet her family, Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, decides to go, knowing all too well the inevitable and uncomfortable topic of his skin tone. However, nothing could prepare him for what actually lies at the Armitage homestead. Surrounded by elitist, white, upper-class citizens, African-American servants and heavy doses of passive-aggressive racism, Chris can’t help but feel an overwhelming desire to, well, get out.</p>\n<p>Right out of the gate, “Get Out’’ opens with a perfect start that comfortably situates the audience into the unnerving, chuckled tone of the film. With its simple setup and seemingly basic plot, the film’s modest layout would normally signal a run-of-the-mill slasher film. But, as time passes, its structure and narrative become increasingly layered and complicated, proving that this movie is anything but your usual horror flick. There’s a clear crescendo as the film goes on, a rise that leads to both a maddening insanity and a worthwhile payoff. But this progression and escalation is so well-guided due to its intricate and layered plot that the film succeeds where less intelligent ones would fail. The film’s success lies in the fact that it uses this intelligent design for the purpose of entertainment. While sections of “Get Out” do address deeper and politically sensitive topics, the film never becomes a lecture on political awareness, nor does it ever forget its best quality: its ability to entertain with gripping humor and suspenseful horror.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Peele has absolutely coated and smothered the first half of the film with foreshadowing. Long after you’ve left the theater, these once-hidden details and premonitions will begin to click in your brain, allowing you to uncover aspects of the film you weren’t originally conscious of. This attention to detail makes “Get Out” the kind of movie you can watch over and over again without ever getting bored. This technique is mostly found in Peele’s often tongue-in-cheek script. Dialogue is riddled with references and coded words that stand out like a sore thumb. In the paranoid setting, you begin to question even the smallest details. Nearly every line seems to have a hidden meaning, and by the end of the film, the script’s payoff is nearly mind-blowing. It’s jam-packed with so many hidden goodies that it would be nearly impossible to grab everything on the first go. “Get Out” definitely warrants multiple viewings.</p>\n<p>The same attention to detail can be found in the film’s sound design. While the score is a bit lackluster and often falls to the background, the sound design ends up by playing an integral role in both the narrative and the immersive nature of the film. Distinct sounds will begin to stand out and change meaning as the film goes on, playing into both the plot and the characters’ personalities. It sounds a bit complicated, but it works so seamlessly and on so many levels without much effort on behalf of the audience.</p>\n<p>These tricks and techniques transform “Get Out” into some kind of participatory mystery-thriller. It’s like the movie begs the audience to solve its puzzle. All the pieces are there for you to figure it out, you just need to pay attention to the detailed clues. And that’s part of what makes “Get Out” so much fun; its engagement of the audience. However, as much as you try to figure it all out, the film’s shocking twists will surprise even the most careful observer.</p>\n<p>The film also closely follows the protagonist, rarely showing us something that he hasn’t seen himself. It’s in this connection to Chris that the film relays most of its humor and suspense. The most horrifying moments are to be found when the camera lingers on a single shot, refusing to cut away. Like Chris, we are forced to helplessly watch as some terrifying force comes running straight toward us without any breaks. It’s a refreshing step away from the jump-scare. Taking advantage of its incredible sound design, this kind of experience also occurs in the much-advertised hypnosis scene in the film. I won’t give anything away, but I can tell you that it’s been a long time since I’ve felt that uncomfortable while watching a movie. The rhythmic and nerve-wracking sounds force you to experience Chris’s stress almost too well.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_76124\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1227778867\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76122\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76124\" data-attachment-id=\"76124\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/film-title-get-out/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1586&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1586\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Film Title: Get Out\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=888%2C688&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76124\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2-250x194.jpg?resize=250%2C194\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=768%2C595&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C793&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Flickr Creative Commons</p></div>\n<p>As a character, Chris’s calm demeanor can sometimes come off as a bit bland. But this reserved performance seems more intentional, displaying his ability to deal with the constant racism that’s thrown his way. He just isn’t fazed by it anymore, and his indifference is quite humorous. It also helps us to identify more with his character, as if we are vicariously experiencing his horror. While the other actors and actresses generally do a good job, there are some definite standouts. Lil Rel Howery, who plays Rod, is by far the comedic showstopper. His insight into the crazy events is hilarious and always brings the tone of the film back to comedy. But when it comes to horror, the scene-stealer here is the unnerving and troubled Georgina, played by Betty Gabriel. Her facial expressions and peeled-back smile are enough to make you shudder. Paired with close-up shots that are too much to look at and line delivery that is absolutely haunting, Georgina is sure to become a contemporary — and someday classic — movie “monster.”</p>\n<p>But as far as monsters go, there is no bigger villain here than racism. While this review won’t go too far into detail, it is worth mentioning how politically relevant most of the film is. As expressed above, the film always maintains a lighthearted and entertaining demeanor, but its acknowledgement of the issue of racial microaggression and even the principle of eugenics is something to stop and think about. Rarely does this become too overbearing, as the microaggression within the film ranges from clever and subtle to overly blatant and straight to uncomfortably hilarious.</p>\n<p>What is perhaps most terrifying about Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” is that its fictional world is only a small satirical step away from the one we live in. Aside from its relevant social critiques, the film stands foremost as an immensely fun and engaging feature. It’s nearly impossible to find anything wrong with “Get Out,” which explains its incredible success with the critics. I can’t think of a single person who wouldn’t have a fun time seeing this film. While it’s not the be-all-end-all Kubrick masterpiece that some people are claiming, it is, however, likely to be the most fun you will have at the movies for a very long time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76122\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76122\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/","id":5824,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5823,5822,5821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hitchcock Channeled Through Music’s Rhythmic Ghost","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Blackmail” is the perfect film for which Michael Mortilla to compose to.

Each classic film will be examined in a new light with the help of guest speakers, including film scholars, industry experts and “The Birds” actress Tippi Hedren.</p>\n<p>The Expanded Hitchcock series began with 1929’s “Blackmail,” a British thriller that was released in both silent and sound versions. As Britain’s first sound film, it was, and still is, heavily praised for its groundbreaking accomplishments. However, the silent version seems greatly preferred in the critic’s eye. Despite Hitchcock’s surprising early control and mastery of sound technique, critics often point to the silent version as the stronger of the two. One such critic happens to be guest Michael Mortilla, an incredibly talented and highly sought after freelance composer, who provided an original, live piano accompaniment for the rarely seen silent version of Hitchcock’s “Blackmail.”</p>\n<p>Mortilla’s resume is remarkably impressive. From composing for the 1996 Olympic Games to his multiple commissions from the Library of Congress, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the National Film Preservation Foundation, it’s easy to see Mortilla’s wide reach and influence in the art of sound design. However, one of his most impressive feats has to be his recent work at the New Objectivity exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in January of last year. Mortilla played for more than eight hours straight, providing accompaniment to four lengthy films. While this would be impressive on its own, there is one thing that separates Mortilla from most modern day composers: everything he composes is completely improvised, including Thursday night’s performance of “Blackmail.” That, and the fact that he didn’t leave that eight-hour LACMA performance even once to use the restroom, is perhaps the most remarkable thing about Michael Mortilla.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As much as the night was an exploration of the rarely seen silent version of “Blackmail,” it was equally a celebration of the wonderful creativity of Mortilla. Moderator Charles Wolfe, a professor of the Film &amp; Media Studies Department at UCSB, began the post-screening interview by asking Mortilla how he prepared and executed his performance with such precision without the aid of a score or sheet music. After jokingly refusing to answer Wolfe’s question, Mortilla began to explain his technique.</p>\n<p>He begins his rehearsals by improvising through an entire screening of whatever film he is to perform to. This can include anywhere from seven dry runs to none at all. This time, however, he “practiced his ass off.” He typically continues to improvise until “something sticks,” at which point he begins to solidify a general outline of his upcoming performance. For “Blackmail,” he knew he was ready when he was able to play his entire piece without the help of the film, relying entirely on his memory.</p>\n<p>While he doesn’t have a score, Mortilla does have a general feeling as to what the film should sound like. “The screen is my palette,” said Mortilla, beginning to explain the ways in which he concentrates his improvisation on a diegetic grounding. His overall goal is to “create an actual atmosphere that the people actually live in,” and so his improvisation is mostly inspired by the story and themes of the films themselves. This focus on a narrative theme and feeling helps keep Mortilla on track and ties his improvisation together within the confines of the film. For “Blackmail,” the result is a tense and percussive theme that reinforces the film’s stressful, noir tone. In fact, it was Hitchcock’s often complicated and layered tone that influenced much of Mortilla’s own score for “Blackmail.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75261\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1234001996\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75260\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75261\" data-attachment-id=\"75261\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/hitchcock-channeled-through-musics-rhythmic-ghost/blackmail/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?fit=2048%2C1436&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1436\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"blackmail\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?fit=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?fit=888%2C623&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-75261 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail-250x175.jpg?resize=250%2C175\" width=\"250\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=768%2C539&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?resize=1024%2C718&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blackmail.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Pollock Theater</p></div>\n<p>With a penchant for dark humor and irony, Hitchcock often complicates the lines between a suspenseful thriller and a tongue-in-cheek comedy. Mortilla had to address this dichotomy, deciding his score had to “keep an emotional content void.” With so many layers of emotion and underscores of ironic impending tragedy behind nearly every scene, the score could not be entirely happy nor entirely sad. In the end, the score had to arrive at a neutral energy level, with the occasional spike and suspenseful build up.</p>\n<p>Mortilla had to consider the same balancing technique when it came to Hitchcock’s peculiar pacing of the film. “The pacing changes in a snap second,” answered Mortilla, when asked how his score was influenced by Hitchcock’s use of motion. With both the camera and actor moving and stopping so frequently in “Blackmail,” Mortilla had to be ready to stop at a moment’s notice. However, this is one of the many things Mortilla loves about Hitchcock: the way “he suspends time, (and) forces us to go slow,” as if the director himself was telling Mortilla to stop. And that is exactly what Mortilla does.</p>\n<p>When he goes to see other live accompanists, he ends up wanting “to run out of the theatre screaming.” His frustration stems from seeing the other silent film accompanists playing for themselves and showcasing their own talent, instead of sitting down and playing what would be best for the film. According to Mortilla, there is only a “pocket” of four or five composers who play to the film in the same manner as he does. Mortilla believes what many of the musicians lack is a proper background in movement, as most of them aren’t rooted in genres associated with dance. Mortilla, however, is no stranger to movement and dance. In addition to his previous work as the former resident composer for UCSB’s Theater and Dance department, Mortilla also worked very closely with Martha Graham — the mother of modern dance — composing and playing for her and her dance troupe across the nation for a variety of events.</p>\n<p>For Mortilla, improvisation is all dance, and it’s no doubt one of the reasons he finds a love for Hitchcock. “Blackmail” is the perfect film for which Michael Mortilla to compose to. Its challenges in balance, from tone to pace, keep Mortilla’s ever changing melody on its toes. Each key is pressed for the sake of the film.

There isn’t much to be found in story, or in meaning, but if all you’re looking for is an intense horror/thriller hybrid with lots of gore and violence, then this is exactly the film you need.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When a punk rock band gets desperate for a gig, they find themselves playing in a seedy venue filled with white supremacists. After stumbling upon a gruesome murder scene, the group is forced to take shelter in the venue’s green room, while the owner and his ruthless gang try to cover up their tracks by murdering the witnesses.</p>\n<p>If you’re a fan of Saulnier’s previous work, “Blue Ruin,” then you’re going to be right at home. For any fan of the late Anton Yelchin, who tragically passed away earlier this year, a great performance of his is to be found among the superficial action and blood. It’s one of the most shocking, grotesque and fun movies of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>“Manchester by the Sea”</strong></p>\n<p>For what is probably the most well-known out of this list, “Manchester by the Sea” is an overwhelmingly critically acclaimed drama about an emotionally absent janitor (played by Casey Affleck), who distances himself from the world. When a new tragedy strikes, Lee (Affleck) is called to reconnect with what is left of his family, forcing him to face the hidden trauma he had hoped to keep submerged.</p>\n<p>Solidified by its strong performances and grounded in reality with its nuanced script, “Manchester by the Sea” is remarkably similar to this year’s “Moonlight.” It’s a story that has drama, heartbreak and tragedy, but it treats its subject matter with such respect and consideration that the emotional dilemmas are never presented as something done just to tug at the heartstrings. Instead, the film’s focus is on the effect of trauma rather than the dramatic trauma itself. Affleck’s Golden Globe-winning performance is so real and reserved it’s hard to find a moment in which he seems to be acting. It’s filled with a hidden pain that is difficult to watch at times.</p>\n<p>It’s an incredibly human piece that seamlessly weaves between deep depressions and warm hilarity. With by far the greatest male performance of the year and with incredible polish by writer and director Kenneth Lonergan, it is guaranteed to be a favorite in the Oscar season.</p>\n<p><strong>“The Light Between Oceans”</strong></p>\n<p>With what could perhaps be considered as the antithesis to “Manchester By the Sea,” especially with its lackluster critical reception, “The Light Between Oceans” is at times melodramatic, self-indulgent and even, dare I say, cliché. But it’s all so expertly pulled off by director Derek Cianfrance (“Blue Valentine”) that it’s easy to let go of these reservations and enjoy what is a beautiful and classically crafted film.</p>\n<p>The plot follows WWI veteran Tom (Michael Fassbender) and his new wife Isabel (Alicia Vikander) as they struggle with their new life as operators of a lighthouse on a secluded island. After the couple runs into difficulty trying to conceive a child, their prayers are seemingly answered. What at first seems like a miracle quickly turns into an ethical and moral dilemma that simultaneously heals and destroys their relationship and humanity.</p>\n<p>With remarkable performances, a period piece setting that seems to be written by Jane Austen herself, and a low-stakes melodramatic tone, the film wears its desire to be a classic drama on its sleeve. At times this drive brings out the worst in the film, with gimmicky setups and predictable plot points, but it by no means diminishes the craft and engrossing nature of the film.<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movie1-e1484807315605.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"879313952\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74969\"><br>\n</a></p>\n<p><strong>“The Witch”</strong></p>\n<p>Robert Eggers’s “The Witch” is such a masterfully crafted horror picture Kubrick that himself is somewhere smiling. It oozes dread at every corner, with such a demanding atmosphere that you’d be a sadist if you still felt comfortable five minutes in. It’s shocking how controlled and beautifully polished Eggers manages to present his feature debut. Each scene is gorgeously terrifying, and every story beat is as equally unnerving as the one that came before. Alongside its perfected tone comes a cast of convincing thespians, delivering historically dense and rich lines with such conviction and natural effort you begin to believe it’s all really happening before your eyes.</p>\n<p>The film follows a religious colonial family as they move to the outskirts of a forest. As they begin to experience satanic disturbances, the family’s religious conviction and dedication wavers, unraveling their familial bonds and dragging into question whether satanic force or religious prudence is the cause of their waking nightmare.</p>\n<p>It’s original, terrifying and by far the best horror movie since “The Babadook.”</p>\n<p><strong>“The Lobster”</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps the most original film of 2016, director Yorgos Lanthimos’s “The Lobster” distinguishes itself as one of the most uniquely disorienting films of the last decade. With cold, blunt surrealist humor, “The Lobster” twists our typical societal conventions of romance and love into cruel, calculated and methodical dictations.</p>\n<p>A group of hopeless, lonely singles are checked into a hotel with a 45-day limit to find a companion of their choosing before they are horrifically transformed into the animal of their choosing. The deadpan, mundane insanity escalates a charming setup into a very real metaphorical nightmare. We watch as prospective lovers violently hunt hotel escapees, sadistically lie to seduce each other, and subdue their human instincts in gruesome ways, all in the pursuit of “true love” and happiness.</p>\n<p>With a unique and outstanding performance from each of its cast members, “The Lobster” is comedically brilliant, absurdly confusing and the most refreshing film of 2016.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74969\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74969\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/5-movies-you-may-have-missed-in-2016/","id":5819,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5818,5817,5816],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Jackie’ Highlights the Horror of Making History","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-01-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14720557_2131354267090741_3430101567619285793_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14720557_2131354267090741_3430101567619285793_n.jpg?resize=960%2C640&ssl=1","description":"There is no way to escape Jackie’s situation, and we as an audience are stuck with her in this disturbingly surreal hell. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rarely does a film come along that induces headaches quite like Pablo Larraín’s “Jackie.” It’s not the kind of headache that comes from watching an unbearable film, but the kind that emerges when a film knows how to string its audience along its ever-increasing and stressful devolution. “Jackie” is a remarkable feat in atmosphere and character analysis, but it forgoes its story and structure in favor of an intense, and at times over the top, psychological slideshow of cut and paste moments from the life of a political widow.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, First Lady Jackie Kennedy, played by Natalie Portman, contemplates her place in a world without the man she had so often been defined by. Terrified by the thought of becoming forgotten in the depths of history, Jackie works to solidify her husband’s legacy as an American icon. But through her attempts to become immortalized, she slowly begins to lose her grip on both her identity and sanity in the face of cultural irrelevance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With its focus on tone and character, “Jackie” takes some liberties with its narrative structure. The plot jumps from flashback to flashback, changing its location in time as frequently as it changes its positioning of narrative moments. The film is framed by an epilogue to the plot in the form of an interview that details Jackie’s mindset more than her actual recounting of specific narrative events. This jarring back-and-forth from contemplation to varying glimpses into the events following the assassination, prevents the audience from being able to watch a chronological story of Jackie’s descent into slight madness. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackie is always found to be in a state of distress, locking the film into a perpetual neurotic state. With such a lack of narrative progression, the film dances the line between becoming surreal and lazy. With each and every glimpse into the week following JFK’s assassination, we are treated to an overwhelming and frustrating feeling of déjà vu. Each scene feels and looks the same, with Jackie showcasing her unraveled mind amidst a materialistic environment. There is no way to escape Jackie’s situation, and we as an audience are stuck with her in this disturbingly surreal hell. The déjà vu is further established with the cinematography and soundtrack. The shots are absolutely stunning, alternating between long and ornate frames to close and claustrophobic tracking. These two styles trade off and repeat scene after scene. The score is chilling, uncomfortable and completely nauseating. Just like the cinematography, the score repeats itself over and over again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the repetition that makes the film such a fantastic headache. Having the cinematography and soundtrack paired with the monotonous narrative design, the film presents a woman stuck in limbo, unable to move on with her life. There isn’t a clear progression of character development or of plot advancement, and this delay bleeds into the redundant and nauseating feeling that nothing is progressing or moving forward, that Jackie herself is stuck in the moment that follows her husband’s death.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the most impressive aspect of the film is the character presentation. While it can be seen as one-dimensional, Natalie Portman no doubt gives one of the most haunting performances of the decade. There is a perfect comparison to be made between her Jackie Kennedy and Daniel Day-Lewis’ Daniel Plainview. Both are at times overacted, but they are both so incredibly dedicated and disturbed that their overindulgence in performance is overshadowed by the perfection of their craft. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Jackie” excels in creating one of the most unnerving atmospheres seen in recent cinema. With its troubling yet beautiful score and familiarized repeating scenarios, “Jackie” creates a world in which time has completely stopped. Director Pablo Larraín successfully immerses the audience into his twisted vision, trapping us with Jackie as she attempts to escape her nauseating horror through the immortalization of her dead husband. The images and moments presented are truly haunting, but its two-hour run time begins to exhaust its overdone themes and moral quandaries by the overstuffed final fourth of the film. “Jackie” never quite hammers home these themes or moral questions, but instead allows them to linger in uncertainty for the audience to contemplate long after it is over. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74657\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/jackie-highlights-the-horror-of-making-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74657\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/jackie-highlights-the-horror-of-making-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/jackie-highlights-the-horror-of-making-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/jackie-highlights-the-horror-of-making-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/jackie-highlights-the-horror-of-making-history/","id":5852,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5851,5850,5849],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Beasts’ is Not So Fantastic","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1","description":"'Beasts' is brave enough to detach just enough from its enormously successful predecessor, however, the film relies too much on its pre-established and well-realized setting and lore.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a short break, the Harry Potter franchise returns with a conflicted prequel that has difficulty finding its own voice. Unlike other prequel series, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is brave enough to detach just enough from its enormously successful predecessor, introducing characters unlike that which we’ve seen before and tones that are at times hilarious and genuinely troubling. However, the film relies too much on its pre-established and well-realized setting and lore, losing its grip on executing anything original, fumbling around with its clashing tones and plots.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fantastic Beasts” follows magical zoologist Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne, as he journeys to New York in the 1920s. Upon arrival, Newt immediately loses and unleashes his misunderstood creatures and heads out to find them with unlikely and newly found friends. All the while, a conflict between wizards and the No-Maj (American’s version of the Muggle, those who don’t practice magic) seems to be brewing, as a dark unknown force begins to terrorize Manhattan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of working together, the duel plots of “Fantastic Beasts” are constantly at odds. The first plot, which follows Newt and his friends, is at times charming and hilarious, focusing on the revealing of magical beasts or fantastic locales. Sadly, it never develops its characters and chooses to rely on the setting as a crux for its content. And while the concept of tracking down monsters is a rather fresh and intriguing one, it’s rarely utilized and mostly, disappointingly, absent from the film.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other plot, being far darker, verges on the macabre, and takes itself rather seriously, although it is never given enough time to be anything more than a tease for the eventual climactic reveal. However, some things accomplished during this tone are incredible and disturbing, a welcome risk into darker and controversial territory. The potential conflicts raised here are more compelling than what was seen at Hogwarts, but fortunately for the original series, and unfortunately for the audience, these conflicts are never really explored and are laughably resolved. In the same intensified way, it would have been nice to see the light-hearted moments push farther into the ridiculous and the comedic. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74511\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"68081505\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74494\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74511\" data-attachment-id=\"74511\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/movies-111816-square640/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"movies-111816-square640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74511 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=640%2C640\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74511\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Fantastic Beasts” follows magical zoologist Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne (left), as he journeys to New York in the 1920s.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two tones work well on their own, but there is not much effort given to bring the two together, resulting in two separate films that are thin in content. In addition, any time spent with each plot is plagued by strange and counterproductive pacing. The film spends too much of its time in unimportant places and rushes right out of where it should be staying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best aspect of the film by far is its production design. From the adorable and inventive creatures, to the stunning magical sets, “Fantastic Beasts” establishes its world flawlessly, engrossing the audience for its entire running time. No doubt benefited by the world already established by the Potter franchise, “Fantastic Beasts” still manages to feel both refreshing and nostalgic. It’s pure bliss. This magical side of New York is just as much as an enjoyable spectacle as Hogwarts was, and with the added 1920s time period there’s a sense of style and maturity that demands to be taken in. The film is fun and makes you feel like you’re a part of the world around you. But while the setting and peacoat costumes may look incredible, the characters that tenant these designs are rather bland and shortchanged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand out performances by Dan Fogler and Colin Farrell do their best to provide the film with enjoyable characters. Fogler, who plays Jacob Kowalski, a hopeful No-Maj baker with his heart on his sleeve, is genuine and hilarious, eliciting a contrasting humor to the forced absurdity of his situation. Farrell, who plays Graves, director of magical security, provides an elusive, dark character that is mysterious in motivation thanks to his complex and seemingly honest presentation. These two easily steal every scene they’re in. The other characters, however, are not so great.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Waterston’s Tina is not only incredibly awkward, but awkwardly performed. Her gawky nature is rarely charming and her character never really clicks. In the same guise, Redmayne’s Newt is also awkward, but manages to provide a quiet and reserved charm. Even so, his quirks are too subtle and are rarely used to make him an interesting character. His lopsided grin and aversion to eye contact begin to mold him into a unique character, but his development stops there. Even with a 133-minute running time, none of these characters are given enough to be fleshed out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A creative, yet thin product, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is torn between far too many things to become anything outstanding in and of itself. It’s visually engaging, but incredibly hollow and directionless. It’s remarkably fun and comical, but by no means memorable. Without the Harry Potter backing, “Fantastic Beasts” could have become another failed attempt at creating a new fantasy franchise. There’s more good than bad to find here, but it’s definitely a personal weighing of pros and cons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The characters are undeveloped and the plot is barren, yet the ride is exciting, and at times quite a blast. The lack of content can even be overlooked for the film’s spectacular immersion. It’s a mindless blockbuster, but it has just enough quirk and creativity to keep it afloat and overcome most of its problems. Nonetheless, it’s not really about finding fantastic beasts or about anything else for that matter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it’s far from fantastic, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is by no means “The Phantom Menace,” and if you’re looking for a hollow yet visually stunning, well-produced and fun blockbuster, it is a must.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/","id":5858,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5857,5856,5855],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/772"}},"__N_SSG":true}
