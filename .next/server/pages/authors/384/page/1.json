We can hardly remember what it was like before the debut of the iPhone in 2007 — just 13 years ago. Twitter was founded 14 years ago, and now one of the most influential people on the planet, the President of the United States, sometimes sends out “information” over 100 times a day through the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all of these technological advances, university life hasn’t changed much in the past 50 years — we still go to a lecture hall with over 200 people, professors still use chalkboards with chalk dust everywhere, and while we may have GauchoSpace and Umail, most students still prefer hand-written homework. There’s something irreplaceable about this aspect of learning. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020, everything changed due to COVID-19. I have spent 95% of my time during the past two and a half months indoors in my apartment in Isla Vista. COVID-19 has forced an evolution to remote learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote learning is efficient, or at least it was intended to be. The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time. It is meant to be a direct connection to knowledge and professors. Yet my experience is that there are a lot more factors to take into account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, not going to school breaks the psychological state of studying. Rolling out of bed and opening my 32-inch display screen, which I also use to watch YouTube and play games, doesn’t make me feel like studying. I try my best to avoid using my laptop for leisure during the day, but it’s unavoidable. It requires much persistence to stay focused. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compare this to sitting in a classroom, which is quiet and has hundreds of people around you studying. Even if you drift away for a bit, you usually come right back to focus because it “feels” like the right thing to do. As far as efficiency is concerned, while cutting back some inefficient activities, remote learning also introduces new ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, because it is more or less a forced change, a lot of details have not been figured out. For example, many lecturers are not used to writing on a tablet and screen recording, so now, they make videos talking over prepared slides. As a result, students can no longer see the steps of derivation, and they lose their natural signs and annotation in graphics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue is with homework grading. The process usually involves students handing homework into a collection box before a deadline; then, the TA would collect them and distribute them to graders. Now, many classes use the GauchoSpace built-in function, which is, to put it mildly, bad for anything that requires stepped grading and commentary. Luckily, some commercial solutions exist, and many classes in S.T.E.M. subjects are utilizing them. It is impressive to see classes quickly learning to use these new tools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, I think COVID-19 has forced innovation and exploration on the individual level, and remote learning will be a good thing in the long run. We are prepared to find a new way of living and learning with more resilience.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Jerry Ling</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hitherto, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has already</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> surpassed 2 million in America</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which represents </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over a quarter of the known cases</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the world. As the most powerful country with access to some of the best medical care and most advanced technologies, it is worth considering why there are a rising number of cases in the U.S. because this pandemic affects not only the overall economy of the nation, but also every one of us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I appreciate that UCSB had changed its teaching mode to online before the coronavirus was widely spread. With this opportunity, I have returned to my home country, where the situation is mostly under control. Thanks to my professors, I do not have to stay up late to participate in live meetings because of my current time zone. In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have been successful in keeping our classes up and running by leveraging our technology. Besides some of the negative experiences that remote learning may bring us, I think that it can also benefit us in many ways. For example, students save time they would normally spend commuting, therefore freeing up more time for focusing on their studies. They are also able to watch the recorded lectures repeatedly to strengthen any points in their classes they do not understand. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we have had to abandon face-to-face conversations, I think this is an acceptable change. Nothing is more important than our collective safety. Turning to the discussion on online examinations, I do want to stress that teachers should be more flexible and considerate with students. We are all uneasy because of the current circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From my point of view, remote lecturing has been quite successful at UCSB. However, I am suspicious about the assertion that students can return to the campus in September. Although I have complete faith in UCSB’s resilience, I believe it is too early to make decisions. The situation seems to be persistent and since this type of lecturing is working, I think we should continue to learn online in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Robert Chen</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid problems like Internet connectivity and time zone differences, I chose to remain in Santa Barbara during this period of remote learning. I was pretty optimistic about the epidemic at the time, and I thought that the situation would surely improve before summer vacation. So, I rented a house with my friend in Goleta and was ready to get used to this new learning method. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, spring quarter did not proceed as successfully as I anticipated. As a pre-chem student, I had to take two labs this quarter. It was very inconvenient to conduct both of the lab courses in an online format. Students had no access to manipulate data and make measurements by ourselves. Although TAs would record experiment videos for us, the experiments were not conducted by our own hands, and there were always some problems that we could not understand. We had to repeatedly stop and ask questions when finishing our lab reports, which was time-consuming. In addition, the lab manuals were partly revised because of the online learning. In one class, we needed to spend an extra two to three hours to complete each lab report. It seemed we did not truly grasp the knowledge we needed to learn in labs, and we wasted a lot of time.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did see some positive results from online learning. Many of my courses were recorded. This meant that I could choose when to study according to my habits. I did not have to get up early to catch the bus to campus and have to feel tired. I obtained a lot more sleep than I usually have and was more energetic when studying. In this way, online learning was helpful; however, I found I was not disciplined at home without a structured campus schedule. It was hard to be persistent with online learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 virus outbreak turned out to be much worse than I expected. I hope that our in-person interactions will return as soon as possible. My roommate got a flight to return home two weeks ago, so I am the only one left in the house. The air tickets are very expensive and difficult to purchase now. I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p>\n<p>– <em>Candace Chen</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-95010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-95010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/","id":5709,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5708,5707,5706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Speak Out On Coronavirus","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2020-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students share their perspectives on coronavirus, the global health emergency.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent outbreak of coronavirus, a respiratory infection which has spread from Wuhan, China to over 25 other countries, has taken the lives of more than 2,000 people to date.

Not long ago, she was simply perceived as an international college student. Now she is labeled a Chinese student from Wuhan –– the origin of the disease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The imperceptible potential of contracting</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coronavirus, as well as the rate of propagation, are disturbing. Because the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virus can have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html\">an incubation period</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html\"> of up to 14 days</a>, people are traveling abroad without awareness that they are infected. This boosts the spread of the disease</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As a result, there is a great deal of criticism toward Chinese people, as they are being blamed for bringing the virus into new countries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend admitted that she has been upset by certain interactions on our own campus. Even though she returned to school in early January, when the disease had just begun to spread, her family and friends are still in Wuhan. “There is nothing I can do, except tell them to wear masks,” she recalled. She said she feels helpless and is deeply concerned for her family and friends. The harmful comments that she has observed on the news and social media posts have depressed her further. The news blames people from Wuhan for consuming exotic animals and traveling during this time period. </span>My friend feels disappointed when she notices the people around her acting extremely cautious, as if she herself is some kind of virus<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Society should be geared toward an environment where race is not the primary criteria to judge one another.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It hurts,” my friend confessed. “People should not generalize and attribute the virus to the whole Chinese population.” She pointed out that “there are restaurants refusing to allow Chinese people in.” While it is true that the disease originated from China, extrapolating this to all Chinese people is not a productive reaction. </span>“Society should be geared toward an environment where race is not the primary criteria to judge one another,”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was both surprised by and sympathetic to what my friend from Wuhan has encountered. The response of unfair overgeneralization hurts people’s feelings. As a Chinese student myself, this is especially disheartening to hear about. Next time you meet an international student, throw away the stereotypes and maybe take a moment to learn about who they really are. If they are a Chinese student from Wuhan, ask them, “How are your parents? Is your family doing okay?” or simply respond with a hug. That would be sweet. I hope our world can become better with a little respect and a lot of empathy, because sometimes a little consideration goes a long way. </span></p>\n<p><em>– Jessica Kuo</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara students should not be overly paranoid about coronavirus spreading to our campus. First of all, since the disease originated in China, the only way for the virus to get to Santa Barbara would be from a community member traveling to and from China. As most UCSB faculty and students returned from winter break before the virus was discovered, we are not at high risk of contraction. Santa Barbara doesn’t have an international airport and it isn’t an overly popular tourist city. There is very little chance that the citizens here have been exposed to the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/18/world/18reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most airlines have recently canceled flights</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> between China and other countries. The federal government has also </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2020/02/05/travel-restrictions-tied-coronavirus-stall-travel-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enacted a new policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stating that all tourists from China must be quarantined and observed for 14 days, which is the extent of the incubation period of the virus, before they can leave and go about their business. The last two cases in California have been confined and quarantined to hospitals. The virus is still far away from us. It is an overreaction to ask for our campus to be shut down.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students who are healthy, please respect those who are sick or wearing masks.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the chances of exposure to coronavirus are very low, we cannot presume our community is a completely safe zone. Along with coronavirus, there are also several kinds of influenza circulating in the U.S. Students should wear masks to protect themselves from catching the flu from public areas, especially in crowded places, such as the library or large lecture halls. Since some symptoms of these flus are similar to the coronavirus infection, people who have a fever, cough and breathing difficulties should visit Student Health and receive a diagnosis for their illness. After that, they should avoid going to crowded places or talking to other people without a mask because the flu is also highly contagious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, for students who are healthy, please respect those who are sick or wearing masks. All we mask-wearers want to do is keep viruses and disease from spreading. Please do not laugh at people wearing masks or insult them for doing so. Be friendly and sympathetic and let hope fill our campus.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Hondong Huang</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Chinese international student who wants to pursue a career in health, I have to raise my voice: The epidemic is not an excuse to be racist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am fortunate to have not yet personally experienced any racial prejudice at UC Santa Barbara. However, my best friend, who studies at Emerson College in Boston, was verbally assaulted by a couple of strangers because she is Asian and wore a mask. Also, some of my non-Chinese friends have told me that their parents have advised them to stay away from Chinese people. I was shocked and saddened to hear that people would start to blame and fear an entire ethnicity during this health emergency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these people fail to realize that the Chinese are just as afraid as everyone else — or possibly even more afraid. We are scared and sad because our friends, families and the cities we were raised in are struggling during this catastrophe. Right now, it’s the Lunar New Year, which is the equivalent of the winter holidays for Western cultures, the time of year for family reunions and to spread love and support. However, this year people are quarantined, separated and facing discrimination. The social stigma against Chinese people is growing worse, and when people are quick to blame, fewer are inclined to help.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a battle between </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> humans and the coronavirus. China is just the first victim.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chinese are not a public threat; the virus and those exposed to the outbreak are. This is not an issue of ethnicity, religion, physical appearance, gender, geography or nationality. This is simple science: it’s about a virus spreading among humans and affecting people’s health. This is a battle between </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> humans and the coronavirus. China is just the first victim. Racial prejudice born of this epidemic isolates Chinese people, causing whoever is experiencing symptoms to hide their illness, contributing further to the public health crisis. So stop blaming an entire segment of the population and instead help protect our community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information about the evolving coronavirus epidemic is being clearly and effectively conveyed to the public. As a part of this community, it’s our responsibility to get information from reliable sources and stop panicking. Don’t hate or judge people of Chinese ethnicity. Keep up with the news, focus on the facts and advocate for public health to actively protect our community.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Enjia Zhang</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wuhan is known to have a large exotic meat market, which is why the virus is thought to have originated from one of the animals sold at the market. It was originally thought that the virus could only be spread from direct contact with an infected animal. However, as more information about coronavirus comes to light, researchers have concluded that this disease can also spread from human contact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As densely populated areas, Isla Vista and the UC Santa Barbara campus are prime locations for diseases to spread; coronavirus is no exception. However, there is a lot of false information circulating in the media, giving rise to unnecessary panic. It is crucial that the UCSB community stays up to date with accurate information about the virus in order to remain safe and healthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coronavirus is primarily transmitted through person-to-person contact. It is still unclear whether or not the virus can be passed through touch, such as by touching a surface that an infected person has also touched. Because of the nature of the disease, it is very important to wash your hands thoroughly and often — especially before and after coming into contact with your face, eyes or nose.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot of false information circulating in the media, giving rise to unnecessary panic.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another crucial step that UCSB students can take to prevent the spread of this virus is staying home when they are sick and avoiding close contact with others who are sick with any illness. If the sickness persists, it is imperative to visit a doctor. While the odds of contracting coronavirus in this area are extremely low, early diagnosis can be key in disease prevention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that the measures that should be taken to prevent a possible case of coronavirus are essentially the same measures that should be taken to avoid any common contagious virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get the most up-to-date information, UCSB students should consult credible websites such as that of the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Center for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or speak with their local health care providers. If the public is well-informed and aware of the symptoms and proper preventative measures, it will be easier for health care providers to treat and contain the virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there has been much unnecessary hysteria surrounding the outbreak of this disease. To avoid this, well-informed students should pass along reliable information to others. It is important for the community to be educated in order to keep everyone well versed on the nature of the virus. We should encourage friends and peers to watch out for signs and symptoms while simultaneously keeping in mind that these symptoms could be — and most likely are — indicative of any number of viruses. We must also encourage our community members to maintain healthy living habits, such as washing hands and keeping clean living spaces. In doing so, the UCSB community can remain safe and educated on the outbreak of this world health epidemic.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Maya Wohl</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My homeland is severely suffering from coronavirus. People are forced to stay in their homes and are in great danger. As the virus is still being researched, experts and scientists are not yet certain of the modes of transmission or effective treatments. Thus, people must take up their own efforts to defend themselves against it. Many families and individuals in China are now struggling against the fatal virus, including family members of international students here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we are studying in a foreign country, our minds are consumed with our home country. It is extremely distressing to see that our prosperous hometowns are now empty cities, and many factories and schools are being transformed into temporary hospitals. To help our country get through this difficult time, international students have tried our best to transport medical supplies back to China. Among these supplies, masks and protective suits are most important for avoiding further infection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the UCSB campus, the prevalence of mask-wearing has recently led to an increased amount of discrimination. Although I have never personally experienced this, I have witnessed and read about plenty of racist attacks around the world against Chinese people. We want people to know that most of us never lived in the city where the virus originated and that most of us have not been back to China since the outbreak began. We have had no contact with the virus, so there is no reason for Chinese students to be ostracized. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some western media sources have named the virus “yellow peril,” which is blatant racism.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though coronavirus originated in China, Chinese people should not be labeled as ill or contaminated. Coronavirus is a catastrophe for all human beings, not only Chinese people. Mankind must stick together to persist through collective difficulty. Just like Ebola and -CoV, coronavirus is not anyone’s fault — including those who have been infected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2009, thousands of people were infected by H1N1, or swine flu, a widespread flu which originated in Mexico. However, no one blamed a certain country or race for that pandemic. Though China is working tirelessly to fight against coronavirus and minimize the global death toll, some western media sources have named the virus “yellow peril,” which is blatant racism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chinese students are wearing face masks as a protective measure, because we don’t want to be infected by other people. We are not sick.  I hope the racist behaviors will stop and we can avoid imposing further psychological harm to Chinese students.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Liuyi Chen</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Don’t look at me like I am some kind of freak!” This is what I want to tell the xenophobic students at UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the outbreak of coronavirus, all Chinese students have been put on high alert: many of them started to wear face masks in order to minimize chances of infection. Some people on campus who may not be aware of the seriousness of the situation seem bothered by Chinese students wearing masks. Holly Smith, an administrative nursing supervisor and infection control coordinator at UCSB, suggested that there is no need for those who have not been infected by the virus to wear masks. Yet, the incubation period, the contagious stage of the virus, can last up to 14 days. The purpose of wearing masks is simply to protect one another from the risk of getting infected. Although there are no confirmed cases at UCSB, it is still necessary to implement preventative methods.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should acknowledge the function of facial masks in preventing the spread of any disease.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the chance of an outbreak in Santa Barbara is extremely low, Chinese students are not willing to take any chances. I sincerely ask UCSB students to stop being xenophobic toward the virus. We should acknowledge the function of facial masks in preventing the spread of any disease. It is indecent for people to discriminate against any racial group, especially during such a sensitive time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultural differences also account for this misguided attitude toward mask-wearing. Unlike in western cultures, mask-wearing is a common method of illness prevention in China and other Asian countries. Not only do we wear masks during flu season, we also put on face masks whenever we are sick to stop an illness from spreading further. Face masks certainly do a better job of this than sneezing and coughing into an elbow. And for those who are not sick, masks can diminish the chances of becoming infected.        </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am really sorry that students wearing masks on campus is causing some people to panic. I hope that other students will educate themselves about the benefits of face masks and the good intentions of Chinese students who wear them. We do this not only for our own health, but also for the protection of the people around us.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Hao Gong</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/students-speak-out-on-coronavirus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/students-speak-out-on-coronavirus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/students-speak-out-on-coronavirus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/students-speak-out-on-coronavirus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/students-speak-out-on-coronavirus/","id":5717,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5716,5715,5714],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Speak Out On Toxic Masculinity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB students open up about their experiences with toxic masculinity.

The 2014 Isla Vista shooting sparked a national conversation about the damaging impact of traditional notions of masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the spirit of continuing this dialogue, we asked students to share their experiences with toxic masculinity. As these vignettes represent but a fraction of the whole, we encourage readers to share their own stories with one another. By engaging with this issue — and one another — we can move toward individual and collective healing.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88542\" style=\"width: 356px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88542\" data-attachment-id=\"88542\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/students-speak-out-on-toxic-masculinity/masc-paige/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?fit=650%2C772&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,772\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"masc paige\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?fit=210%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?fit=862%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-88542\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?resize=346%2C411\" alt=\"\" width=\"346\" height=\"411\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88542\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can’t remember the last time I cried in public. The last time I remember crying outside of my house is when I watched </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Water Horse</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 12 years old (that shit was sad, okay?). Other than that, I’ve pretty much successfully suppressed every negative emotion I’ve since felt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, I thought I was just emotionally tough. I mean, that’s what my environment taught me. Any sign of anger or sadness was weak, and simply funny to an outside audience. Whether it was my collection of friends or my soccer teammates, the rules of being a man were simple: if someone insults you, you better come up with a more brutal snipe back. If you get hit on the soccer field, you better hit the other player back even harder. If someone makes you feel vulnerable, never give them the power of letting them see it. If your “opponent” in any contentious interaction shows vulnerability, you’ve already won. Toxic masculinity at its finest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I prided myself on being “one of the good guys” growing up, I still remained committed to never letting my somber emotions get the best of me. In my eyes, one of the worst things that could happen to me socially was to have my traditional definition of masculinity questioned by my peers. Not being a complete hot-headed asshole like some of my peers had already garnered enough pestering questions and insults. I was not going to concede any more vulnerability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This worked for a good 19 years. However, it was just not sustainable. I never truly opened up to family and friends. I barely acknowledged the emotions of the girls I was involved with. I goofed around and took serious situations, frankly, not seriously enough. Overall, I pretended I was perfectly fine and in control of my life. As an assortment of family, social and other issues started to pile up, it quickly became apparent that I was not going to last this way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter of my freshman year of college was when I finally broke. I remember getting off the phone with my parents and beginning to sense this growing discomfort in my chest. Soon, I was lying on the floor of my dorm, panic attack in full effect, taking big gasps of air, heart racing and wondering whether I was about to have a heart attack, my composed facade in shambles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what my first concern was as I laid in my bed recovering my breath, 20 minutes later?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m so glad nobody saw me like that.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Kian Karamdashti</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a young age, I was surrounded by toxic ideas about what it means to be a man. As an athlete, I was taught a lot of lessons on the field that translated to other contexts as well. Men are supposed to be aggressive; we’re supposed to take what we want, and under no circumstances should we show vulnerability or pain. I was (incorrectly) told that men are fundamentally and biologically different from women in both our desires and our behavior, and that this rationalized most of the violence we enacted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily for me, I had so many strong and compassionate women in my family that I never truly internalized these beliefs. I was basically raised in a matriarchy, and I knew from a young age that there was certainly no leadership role or job that a man can do that a woman can’t do (and most likely do better). My passion for anthropology inspired me to research and discover that most of what we think about sex and gender is actually not true, and that outdated stereotypes surrounding gender roles are based on patriarchal ideologies far more than on scientific fact.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, it took a lot of labor and arbitrary situations for me to become de-socialized and to grow up valuing empathy and vulnerability over traits we would consider more “masculine.” It shouldn’t be up to women to teach us this. Cisgender men created these toxic notions of masculinity, and it’s up to us to dismantle them. Recent events like mass shootings and the well-documented disparity in domestic violence perpetrated by men compared to women show that we have an issue with young men growing up entitled, ignorant, abrasive, and de-sensitized. It’s so easy in this day and age for men to dehumanize and demonize women personally or through social media, and it’s just not right. We must change ourselves in order to create the world that all women deserve.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Omar Hernandez</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxic masculinity, in my (ill-informed) opinion, is a Rolodex of traits that every man shouldn’t emulate. Regardless of your standing knowledge of the word, it feels as if it is always within earshot. A buzzword, really. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I’ve known about toxic masculinity since high school, its relevance did not emerge until I moved to college — at the other end of the nation. My personal opinions are not matter-of-fact, but I do believe the atmosphere at UC Santa Barbara takes this phrase more seriously than in Buffalo, my hometown. And this makes sense — Southern California is a melting pot for social justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, toxic masculinity isn’t a term that I would use, ever. Its scope is too large, like shielding a pebble from the rain with an umbrella. Telling someone or saying that something is of toxic masculinity helps nobody; that’s stating the obvious. If you really want to make a difference, assess the issue individually, use more precise descriptions and identify the specific root of those actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I do believe that men throughout the world should be held accountable for their actions, the use of this label ultimately highlights the actions of the lower denominations in male society and presents a skewed image of males as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn’t fair. Take your “men ain’t shit” tweets somewhere else. For every asshole out there, another man is working just as hard to support himself and potentially a significant other and family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get lazy and paint the entire picture with just one color: generalizing the actions of men is unjust!</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Max Abrams</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion of toxic masculinity is one that cannot wait — men need to do their part. When one adheres and conforms to the traditional constructions of what manhood is, the consequences can have hegemonic and dangerous implications for oneself and others. These constructions of masculinity are, unfortunately, imposed upon and expected of boys beginning in childhood. Equally unfortunate are the consequences for those who do not act according to a specific template of gendered norms, which historically have been characterized by dominance, assertiveness and self-reliance. These behaviors can lead to more dangerous outcomes, such as misogyny, homophobia or violence. If a man does not adhere to these behaviors, it can lead to exclusion and ridicule from others, further perpetuating the behaviors in a cycle of desired sociocultural validation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By addressing toxic masculinity, we can work to dismantle the harmful behaviors that have been essentialized to construct what constitutes a “man.” Fighting these destructive norms does not subtract from “manhood,” but, rather, subverts repressive notions of gender and upholds fundamental tenets of how one should treat others.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Anonymous</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have always had an effeminate voice, though I have not always known it. I always assumed I had a normal boy voice, just like all the other boys, so why wouldn’t I?

I’m short and fat, with fingers that resemble sausages. I’m not into sports, I’ve never been a fan of cars and I think beer tastes like wet bread. I’ve been told many times that I’m not a man because of these facts and I’ve been ridiculed because I’m not six-foot-plus with rippling muscles and a deep voice. It hurts, especially during the chaotic swirl that was high school. Feeling like I wasn’t what I was supposed to be and that I couldn’t do anything about it shredded my self-esteem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe to them I wasn’t a man. I am, however, a woodworker and a blacksmith. A lumberjack and a powerlifter. I can fix any problem that comes up in your house and I can build a house from the ground up. I bring smiles to the people around me and support to my loved ones. I can cook one hell of a dinner, I clean a house damn well and I know how to ask for help when I need it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxic masculinity showed me what I wasn’t and tried to shame me for it. Instead, I turned around and found what real men are made of.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Miguel Rodriguez</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My life, from childhood to the present, has been rooted in ever-changing ideologies of masculinity. My upbringing was consistent with typical ideas of what it means to be a “man.” Lessons from my dad, an individual heavily indoctrinated with a hegemonic understanding of masculinity, served as an introduction. While he craved hunting trips and sports, I craved wearing dresses, carefully braiding my mom’s hair on days when he was absent. The years passed by, and as my voice grew deeper, my face hairier and my body larger, I felt myself internalizing his ideals and expectations, unaware of their impact. I became less empathetic and my words and actions danced with destruction. Not only had I absorbed my dad’s ideals, rooted in toxic masculinity</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I embodied them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I grew older my mind became weary, my clandestine relationship with queerness yearning to express itself outwardly. Anxiously, I began distancing myself from my father and the many ideas that I had come to believe. This space allowed for a transformation; the expectations imposed by him melted away as I gained other perspectives. Experiences that broke down gender dichotomies and heteronormativity provided understandings previously concealed by my upbringing. The self-hatred I’d harbored due to masculine ideals no longer dictated my behavior. I embraced my desire to cross boundaries — painting my nails the color of the sky, holding hands with boys without fear of ridicule, chasing desires I’d stored in a closet somewhere 300 miles away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I get older, my growth is no longer controlled by traditional notions of masculinity. The walls that my father, and countless other men in my life, aided me in building have lost their height and sturdiness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve had to become gentler with myself and my emotions, with the emotions of others, with the words that men often produce without understanding the impact they have on others. I’ve begun to accept my mind’s fragility and how it influences my interactions with the earth and those that exist upon it. As I become aware of my errors, I feel the need for myself and all men to be constantly aware of the pain they may cause to others, as well as the pain they may cause to themselves.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Dallin Mello</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Masculinity is an interesting concept we have the opportunity to observe in today’s cosmopolitan social sphere. It’s important to acknowledge that masculinity, while sometimes toxic, annoying and inconsiderate, can also be a beautiful thing. I believe that masculinity, or typical male behavior, is something that takes a long time to master. As a college-aged student, I recognize that I still have a lot to learn. To complicate things, our society is learning with us. Growing up, masculinity meant being a gentleman: holding doors open for ladies (and sometimes men), being tough and striving for success. But as I’ve grown up, I’ve realized that, like most things, masculinity is a balance. The beautiful thing about masculinity today is that you can paint your nails, talk about your feelings and still get laid. Masculinity is what you make of it. So please don’t make it toxic. You do you, however masculine you are. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Anonymous</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting in my living room with cis boys for too many days in a row is enough to make me want to curl up on my bed and not talk to anyone.

He thrived on cultural trivia, arguments for the sake of debate and, most of all, plucky banter with his friends. After attending grad school at Georgetown, Steve traveled the world, bouncing from destination to destination, only to land at his final stop in Isla Vista. He had always been focused academically on math and science, but once he moved to I.V., he blossomed into the artsy-fartsy, free-spirited philosopher we all came to love. Then, with a few good friends and a strong peer group at his side, Steve opened a coffee shop called the Coffee Collaborative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Collab, as it was fondly addressed, was an offbeat and quirky shop on the corner of Pardall and Embarcadero. Never having been much of a businessman, Steve ignored traditional corporate tactics and, instead, transformed the Collab into a creative, alternative space. Although it didn’t seem exceptional to some, it was everything to its employees, regulars, locals and passersby. This became the home of debates, late-night talks, laughter, chess and community. It also became, perhaps infamously, a refuge for the lost, alcoholic, homeless and the poor. Regardless of how it was perceived from the outside, the Collab was always a place of belonging and forgiveness and was never a place for judgement — that was all Steve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One might even say that Steve was the purveyor of wayward souls. Perhaps he was so accepting of others because he, at heart, was a lost soul too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve was certainly not a hero, but he touched the lives of many young people; he spurred intellectual conflict, wafted at the edges of his beliefs and challenged those around him to do the same. Aside from being a philosopher, he was also an absurd comic and a wild storyteller. And although he was plagued by darkness, you’d never know it at the sound of his distinctive and well-loved laugh; it had a depth to it, came straight from the belly and would make you laugh along with him just at the sound of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like The Dude from “The Big Lebowski,” Steve always seemed to be caught up in some new fantasy or adventure. However aimless he seemed, his life was never dull and he was always able to find some sort of trouble or mischief. For those who knew him best, Steve was a complex, infectious and influential man full of love and turmoil. Whether he knew it or not, Steve was always surrounded by loved ones through his ups and downs, which was perhaps his greatest blessing. He will always be remembered by those who loved him as a staple, or perhaps a reflection, of Isla Vista and their time here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was and always will be a colorful thread in the fabric of our lives. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87176\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87176\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/","id":5710,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5709,5708,5707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why the UC System Should Divest from Fossil Fuels: a Response to Nathan Prisco","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2017-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/letter-to-the-editor-correct-dimensions.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/letter-to-the-editor-correct-dimensions.jpg?resize=650%2C500&ssl=1","description":"Emily Williams responds to an article published yesterday on why UC should divest from fossil fuels, with a point by point counter on why she believes the UC system should divest, as a symbolic gestur...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On May 18, Nathan Prisco, a graduate student in Chemical Engineering, wrote an op-ed entitled “Why UCSB Should Not Divest From Fossil Fuels”, or, as it might have been called, “What I Still Don’t Understand About Divestment.” As a fellow graduate student, studying climate change in the Geography Department, I’d like to take the opportunity to respond, point-by-point:</p>\n<p>Claim 1: “[The] University of California system is in a powerful position to influence the fossil fuel industry as an important shareholder.” While the UC is a force to be reckoned with, there are a few problems with this statement. First of all, the UC doesn’t hold enough investments in any one company to significantly influence companies via its shares. Second, this tactic has been tried, and in this case, companies will not listen to a shareholder engagement strategy that asks them to forgo their bottom line and completely restructure their business model.</p>\n<p>Claim 2: “Previous divestment efforts have proved largely ineffective as a strategy to curtail undesirable practices among corporations.” Many critics of divestment keep conveniently forgetting that the goal of divestment is not about shifting the money and starving the industry of stock value, but rather about the immense cultural shift that results from a respected and powerful institution like the UC deciding to no longer invest in companies that are threatening the futures of the students of their intuition. Making such a claim erases the history that divestment played in bringing on the end of apartheid in South Africa, in pushing the UC to no longer be a passive observer of human rights abuses but to instead stand against white supremacy. On Nelson Mandela’s first visit to the United States after being released from prison he thanked the students at UC Berkeley for their roles in the divestment from apartheid movement. Finally, the tobacco divestment campaign played a crucial role in the public relations struggle over the health impacts of tobacco and directly helped shift cultural norms around smoking. Today, thanks to the cultural shift divestment brought about, it would be scandalous for a university to invest in tobacco.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Claim 3: “The mission of the energy sector is to efficiently and safely implement proven technologies in pursuit of affordable energy.” The fossil fuel industry exists to meet its bottom line. This industry is responsible for oil trains which have derailed and killed innocent bystanders; for increased rates of asthma, cancer, and cardiovascular illness in communities living near power plants; for the mass disregard for people whose livelihoods depends on their environment, as seen with the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the destruction of native lands for the production of tar sands, and the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. We cannot claim that these companies exist for the public good when Exxon created a massive disinformation campaign, hiring Big Tobacco’s top PR firms to discredit the best climate scientists. Why, exactly, should the UC be investing in that level of destruction?</p>\n<p>Claim 4: “We must carefully articulate what it is we hope to achieve…” I applaud this point and the divest-invest movement has garnered so much public support because it doesn’t only focus on what is bad, but also actively pursues investment alternatives into climate justice solutions. This includes investing in community choice energy, education, and renewable startups. As a society, we need to get better at articulating our vision for what kind of world we want to live in; we need to divest from the problem and invest in the solutions.</p>\n<p>Claim 5: “On the other hand, the Obama administration strongly encouraged the expansion of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” as a transitional technology to the renewable age.” Fracking has no place in the low-carbon, just transition that we need as a society. The technology was developed to extract the little remaining oil and gas from nearly depleted wells and has been linked to increases in the frequency of earthquakes, the contamination and waste of precious groundwater, and the destruction of local economies in the boom and bust cycle. Moreover, the fuels being extracted by fracking are still contributing to the climate crisis: natural gas releases methane which, while having a shorter atmospheric residence time, has a stronger global warming potential than carbon dioxide, and in California, fracking is used to extract dense, tar-like oil that releases far more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.</p>\n<p>Claim 6: “UC system has a responsibility to its students and to the California taxpayers.” This statement is absolutely true. Investments in fossil fuels are risky because much of the industry’s reserves will become stranded assets, and hence financially unviable, leading to what experts in the field call a “carbon bubble” when appropriate climate legislation is finally introduced. The UC’s responsibility and its mission – both to the students who must be forced to live with the consequences of climate change, and the people of California who have overwhelmingly demanded climate action – should be aligned with its investment practices.</p>\n<p>How, then, can the UC defend actively investing in companies that are driving climate change which has been attributed by brilliant climate scientists to contributing to the California drought, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Sandy, all bearing heavy costs for this country?</p>\n<p>Students have been actively lobbying for fossil fuel divestment since August 2012, have sat in closed-door meetings with Chancellors, Regents, investment officers, and sustainability officers, and have garnered the support of over 700 faculty UC-wide, 9 A.S. senate resolutions, 3 Academic Senate resolutions, and now the support of 4 Chancellors. Suggesting that the campaign should focus more on being “constructive” and “lobby” instead of using civil disobedience ignores the entire history of the campaign.</p>\n<p>But I don’t blame Prisco for buying into that idea. Our history books have an unfortunate tendency of tidying up how real transformation happens. Systemic change – such as civil rights, the New Deal, and women’s suffrage – doesn’t happen because a group of people politely sit down in a meeting with key decision makers. It happens because those who dare to dream negotiate and demonstrate until human and environmental rights are achieved.</p>\n<p>The fossil fuel industry owns five times more coal, oil, and gas than even the most conservative climate scientists suggest is safe to burn, meaning that 80% of fossil fuels must remain below ground if we are to have any chance of avoiding climate catastrophe. Combatting climate change and the catastrophic poisoning of our communities, water, air, and land has no easy solution. Meaningful change is a long and bumpy road, and Chancellor Yang, accompanied by the chancellors from UCSC, UCSD, and UCD, should be applauded for making bold commitments that are appropriate for the severity of the crises we face. While divestment won’t solve the climate crisis nor repay those who have been sacrificed in the name of cheap energy, it is a meaningful catalyst for change.</p>\n<p><em>Emily Williams is a graduate student in Geography.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77978\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77978\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/","id":6261,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6260,6259,6258],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why UCSB Should Not Divest From Fossil Fuels","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fossil-Fuel-Sit-In-5-10-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fossil-Fuel-Sit-In-5-10-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Graduate student Nathan Prisco weighs in on the issue of the University's divestment from fossil fuels. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As future leaders, we all have a responsibility to do what we can to advocate for solutions to climate change. With approximately $3 billion invested, the University of California system is in a powerful position to influence the fossil fuel industry as an important shareholder. When one divests on moral or ideological grounds, one guarantees that the assets will be controlled and managed by a new party that cares less about the ideas and morals that led to the divestment. In the United States, the boards of directors of public corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to seek profits for the common shareholders. If the owners (shareholders) of the fossil fuel industry do not care about climate change, the companies are legally obligated to similarly not care. Rather than divest, the UC system should exercise its role as a prominent shareholder to pressure fossil fuel companies to adopt more forward-looking policies to address climate change.</p>\n<p>Previous divestment efforts have proved largely ineffective as a strategy to curtail undesirable practices among corporations. In the past, there was a national effort to divest from the tobacco industry due to the known public health consequences of tobacco consumption. Aside from negative publicity, divestment efforts were largely inconsequential. In fact, depressing an industry’s stock prices due to large-scale divestment tends to boost the return on equity available to the remaining shareholders through more effective share buybacks and dividend reinvestment; Philip Morris (now Altria) was one of the highest returning stocks of the past 50 years. The real success of the anti-tobacco movement in the United States, aside from public smoking bans, arose from targeted health advocacy to disseminate information on the negative health effects of smoking.</p>\n<p>The energy industry contains some of the world’s most highly qualified scientists, skilled workers and engineers who work on the most challenging problems of our generation. The mission of the energy sector is to efficiently and safely implement proven technologies in pursuit of affordable energy. For the first time, we are beginning to see renewable energy emerge as a viable large-scale commercial option. Our generation is accustomed to rapid progress and is understandably frustrated by the snail’s pace of the energy sector. However, the energy grid is comprised of hundreds of billions of dollars of existing infrastructure and has been developed for over a hundred years; it is not amenable to rapid change.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Moreover, as an educated student body, we must carefully articulate what it is we hope to achieve and view the energy sector with long-term objectives. For instance, the Obama administration opposed the expansion of many activities such as the use of Canadian oil sands, coal power generation and oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean because these activities have a relatively high environmental impact. On the other hand, the Obama administration strongly encouraged the expansion of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” as a transitional technology to the renewable age. In fact, the United States’ carbon emissions declined by 12 percent from 2005 to 2015, due to the increased use of natural gas over coal for power generation. </p>\n<p>A recent article in the Daily Nexus claimed that Chancellor Henry T. Yang has endorsed Fossil Free UCSB in its calls for divestment. His statement has been misconstrued; he did offer his support to the activists, but he did not explicitly endorse a divestment from fossil fuel industries.<br>\n“I stand by our students who have been sitting in calling for fossil fuel divestment this past week and support their aims … In the coming week, I look forward to working with my fellow chancellors in support of a thorough and transparent discussion on divestment from fossil fuels as part of the UC’s approach to combating the climate crisis.”</p>\n<p>It is encouraging to see an administrator engaged with the student body, although his response leaves much to be desired. As a highly qualified engineer and scientist, Chancellor Yang could use this opportunity as a teaching moment to provide more direction to the activists. Under President Donald J. Trump, research institutions and regulatory agencies are under assault, and now more than ever we need common-sense actions on climate change. Above all, I commend the organizers of Fossil Free UCSB for their impressive achievement and successful display of civil disobedience, but I suggest a more constructive approach. Lobby for new policy to clarify the UC system’s relationship with fossil fuel industries, and engage the regents to commit strongly to climate advocacy in their capacity as shareholders. This includes advocating for increased funding of renewable energy initiatives and fundamental research at our universities and national laboratories, improved regulatory oversight for fracking wastewater disposal and other pollutants and a “revenue-neutral” tax on carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>Even if it otherwise makes sense to divest, the chancellors must consider the impact divestment is likely to have on our community. The UC system has a responsibility to its students and to the California taxpayers to effectively manage its resources in pursuit of its strategic mission. Divestment on moral grounds reduces the universe of potential investments, and this can only decrease the returns available to the overall portfolio. Can the chancellors demonstrate that the opportunity cost of divesting from fossil fuels does not significantly impact the growth of our system’s endowment or the quality of our institution?<br>\nNathan Prisco is a second-year graduate student in the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCSB.

I had some obvious expectations of how my first year would go, perpetuated by the “party school” stereotype. I thought there would be plenty of drinking, plenty of weed and a moderate amount of casual hook-ups. I didn’t expect all of this on my first night, but when in Rome …</p>\n<p>The night seemed to be going pretty normally. My friends and I went to a friend of a friend’s apartment; there was music and booze and boys. I was a happy camper. I was especially happy when one of these boys was actually talking to me. No, he wasn’t just talking to me. He was being nice to me. <em>Nice. </em>Of course, he offered to walk me back to my dorm and we found out we were both staying in FT (Stupid Fuck Towers). At this point, I was having a pretty good time. So when he asked if I wanted to watch “Harry Potter” with him, the only appropriate response in my mind was “Why wouldn’t I?” But let me tell you, Netflix and chill <em>is a trap.</em></p>\n<p>I sort of expected we would end up kissing, and I was cool with it. Our shirts were off and he wasn’t a terrible kisser. I thought it was going to be one of those average make-out sessions that you quickly forget (or try to forget) within a few weeks. Then, oh how sweet, he lays his hand against my neck and tells me I’m pretty. It could have been a scene from a shitty teenage rom-com. Until there was nothing romantic about it anymore. At first I was uncertain if it was really happening, but after about thirty seconds there was no mistaking it. This kid was choking me. Choking me. Tension in his hands and pressure against my trachea. Needless to say, I freaked out. I had one of those damn-it-my-parents-were-right moments. When I inquired of my partner his goal in strangling me, he said he was into BDSM and wanted to try it with me.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If you’re anything like me, the only experience you have had with this mysterious sexual culture is a poorly-written “Twilight” fan fiction that took over popular culture this past Valentine’s Day season. Yes, I am referring to the infamous “Fifty Shades of Grey.” I’m sure the book series and subsequent movies have sparked interest in thousands of people. According to the highly credible magazine “Cosmopolitan,” S&amp;M is now making its way into the mainstream. After experiencing a glimpse into this realm firsthand, however, I thought I would look into the subculture a bit more.</p>\n<p>Once I filtered through the porn advertisements and strange google images, I actually found some surprising information. It turns out that BDSM (Bondage &amp; Discipline, Domination &amp; Submission, Sadism &amp; Masochism) has been growing in popularity over the last few decades. In 1953, Alfred Kinsey published “Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.” One of his studies revealed that approximately half of the people who participated had been sexually aroused by having been bitten. A study published in 1999 by the German Institute for Rational Psychology found that 42 percent of women interviewed stated interest in BDSM techniques, while 25 percent were interested in bondage. In 2009, 39 percent of a sample of college-aged men stated they engaged in sadistic behaviors during sex. And most recently, a 2014 study reported that 19 percent of male participants and 10 percent of female participants found sadistic scenarios described in the questionnaire at least “slightly arousing” when asked to rate their sexual appeal.</p>\n<p>However, I also found that this subculture stresses the importance of mutual respect and consent. Consent as an active conversation before and during any sexual activity in which partners discuss their fantasies and boundaries, to be more specific. Basically, you need to ask somebody if any sort of BDSM practice is okay with them before you start to practice with them. Without this conversation, somebody could think that you are trying to suffocate them while “Yer a wizard, Harry” is coming from your laptop. Yeah, we barely got through the first scene of the “Sorcerer’s Stone.” Even the seductive and successful Christian Grey was polite enough to give Anastasia a full orientation session, complete with a signed contract, and took her in a helicopter before touching her in any unconventional way.</p>\n<p>I learned two things from this interesting experience. First, I would highly recommend getting to know any potential partners before you go to their rooms in the middle of the night. And secondly, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is actually not quite as terrible as I previously thought. You guys should give it a chance if you haven’t already.</p>\n<p><em>Jordan Metz reminds you to see if your sexual partner consents to your kinks before getting down, especially if strangulation is your preferred foreplay. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/","id":6343,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6342,6341,6340],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Column Formerly Known as the Wednesday Hump","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/THAHUMP.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/THAHUMP.jpg?resize=487%2C599&ssl=1","description":"You expect the Hump\r\nWhat you get is a camel\r\nLove your new best friend\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Spoken by a humpless dromedary:</p>\n<p>“Hi, guys!

Finally hooking up in that spot you’ve always wanted to hook up in</strong></p>\n<p>You all know the standard spots: Davidson, top of HSSB, Campus Point, etc. But in your last few weeks, the more public, the better. What are you worried about … getting caught? If you’ve been good for the past four years, you’re gonna graduate, so do less worrying and more exploring. You can also make it more personalized; if you have an office (on or off-campus), go for it. If you have a particular South Hall room that you like to study in, go for it. Hell, if you have a single, go for it, and do it in honor of the thousands that will spend the next year or two shacking up with no one but good ol‘ Mom and Dad (God forbid, they learn about shacker calling).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Actually owning a Walk of Shame.</strong></p>\n<p>The “Hump” has been harping on about this since the beginning of time, but it takes real courage ⎯ or at least real senioritis ⎯ to truly do the Walk of Shame with a whole lot of pride. Instead of slinking home, grab the bull by the horns and head straight to Blenders or Bagel Caf, where you’re sure to run into your acquaintances. Pay for your breakfast with money that you procure from deep within your bra. Lounge outside, soak up the sun and humble brag to anyone you encounter. And if you’ve never had the opportunity to take a Walk of Shame, well then …</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Having a one-night stand.</strong></p>\n<p>That guy flirting with you all night at OTT? The girl dancing up on you at EOS? Chances are, they’re just as much in that “end-of-the-year” mindset as you are, so be bold and make the first move. It’s as easy as, “Wanna split an Uber back to I.V.?” Seriously. But from there on out, it’s all on you.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Hitting up your ex.</strong></p>\n<p>You’ve undoubtedly spent the past few years trying to avoid the first person you ever hooked up with at UCSB at all costs. But now, for nostalgia’s sake, take a dive deep into your phone’s contact list and explore the ghosts of hookups past. Shamelessly booty call that one who wronged you, or that one you dumped in a spectacular fashion. Don’t hesitate to blame everything on senioritis: If your attempt falls flat on its face? Senioritis. If it works, but then your friends ask what the hell you were thinking? Senioritis. Just make sure you’re down to hit it and quit it. If you slip back into old habits, you proved that you’ve learned nothing in your time here, and I will personally show up at your house to rip up your diploma.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. Ending that weird relationship that’s been going on for way too long.</strong></p>\n<p>Honey, you are a grown-ass woman/man now. You are about to enter what people on the street are calling “the real world.” Isn’t it about time you started loving yourself? If you wake up one day in the next six weeks and realize that you are wasting your time in your current situation, you can just get the fuck out without fear of awkward run-ins or division of friends. Or better yet, use them one last time so that you can check #1 off of your list … and then kick ’em to the curb.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-final-countdown-sexin-as-a-senior/","id":6187,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6186,6185,6184],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2014: Year of the Hump","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This year, make some resolutions that you'll actually want to keep.

Get Fit.</p>\n<p>Being in good shape (which does not necessarily entail having a flat stomach or enormous biceps) will benefit you in more ways than you can imagine when it comes to sex.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being in shape is proven to correlate strongly with having confidence, which subsequently helps to reduce anxiety when it’s time for the clothes to come off.</li>\n<li>A background in fitness helps build breath control, a crucial aspect of both enjoying a long-lasting bedroom session … and sounding sexy during it.</li>\n<li>Working out helps build muscle, encourage flexibility and increase aerobic endurance … Let me count the ways in which these will benefit your sex life: You can enjoy longer-lasting and more powerful erections, less leg cramps, less panting, more control over your body, the ability to move yourself around to find that perfect spot and a greater freedom to try new positions that might require you supporting yourself or your partner. Basically, get fit so you can get wild.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2. Be Charitable.</p>\n<p>According to a study conducted in the U.K., exhibiting noble behavior makes both sexes appear more sexually attractive. Therefore, not only will doing charity work make everybody else happier, but it will eventually make you quite a bit happier, too. Although there are different forms of charity, most of which we highly encourage, we are going to teach you the spirit of charity in the bedroom in the hopes that it will translate seamlessly into your public lives as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go down on your partner just because. It doesn’t always have to be a special occasion. This can really spice your night, morning, lunch break, etc. up. (This is even doable on a first date, given the proper circumstances, especially in Isla Vista).</li>\n<li>Try something you know your partner is into, even if you think it might be a little strange. He likes leather — wear some! She likes football — put some pads on! The options are endless.</li>\n<li>A bit of subtlety, for a change, is always a nice surprise: a massage with candles can do wonders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. Get Organized.</p>\n<p>This is the perfect time to reevaluate all of your relationships: If you’ve been dating for a while, make sure things aren’t going stale. It’s the beginning of the quarter, so take this time to figure out a good schedule that allows the two of you to get that quality time in before you get too busy with school and work. Try to find at least one night that will work as date night for this quarter, and commit to that.</p>\n<p>We also know that a Gaucho’s preferred relationship status is something along the lines of, “We’re just having fun,” and that half the fun of having a hookup buddy is the spontaneity of those late-night booty calls, so don’t try to stifle those with organizational thoughts. But if you’re not getting your needs satisfied, yet you keep going back to that one person based on sheer convenience, it’s time to try something new. Remember, there are plenty of fish in the sea … hot, buff, generous, knowledgeable fish… And if you’re in a position where you could possibly be bringing someone home in the near future, get organized first.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your room clean; it’s hard to get steamy in the sack when said sack is full of Doritos crumbs … ew.</li>\n<li>Take an inventory of your Socks&amp;Sex drawer and restock: candles, condoms, oils, toys and props … basically, if you’ve ever been mid-hookup and thought to yourself, “Damn, I wish I had a [blank] right now,” use that Amazon gift card you got as a holiday present to treat yo’self to some <i>personal</i> shopping … thanks, Aunt Karen!</li>\n<li>It may be a new year, and a new you, but don’t think everything that happened in 2013 is now magically erased…if you don’t see where we’re going with this, we’re suggesting it’s a good time to get tested, for you and your partner’s sake (see, you’re being more generous already!) Between the resources offered at Student Health and those at the Planned Parenthood downtown, it’s the one resolution that you have no excuse for not keeping.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. Learn a New Instrument.</p>\n<p>Acquiring a new skill can do wonders for you, especially in the bedroom. Once again, we’re not going to preach that you go out and buy a guitar so that you can serenade your partner; we can’t all be Brett Dennen. But each and every person who is interested in having and/or maintaining a sexual relationship has talents that they can learn or further develop in the bedroom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become an expert on the physiology of sex. Buy a book on anatomy, watch some videos online or ask your partner for a tour. No matter which way you do it, do your best to learn how to better reach something, or tickle something else and make yourself and your future partners happy.</li>\n<li>Find something you think the sexual world is lacking and become a master at it (sometimes trial and error is the only way). For example, learn how to do a great strip tease, give excellent oral sex, last for hours on end, talk just the right amount of dirty or kiss better than anyone ever knew was possible. All of these skills are available to learn from a simple internet search — you have no excuse.</li>\n<li>Learn how to relax in the bedroom. Everybody can better themselves in this respect. Feeling comfortable with yourself is not easy, but it sure is important. This one might take some time, but if you can figure this one out, guitar should be no problem. In fact, you should write a book to let the rest of us in on your secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53426\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/2014-year-of-the-hump/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53426\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/2014-year-of-the-hump/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/2014-year-of-the-hump/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/2014-year-of-the-hump/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/2014-year-of-the-hump/","id":6331,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6330,6329,6328],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Ins and Outs of UCSB","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Dorms A good rule to live by: Don’t do your neighbors!

There are literally thousands of people at this school who you can have whatever sort of freaky interactions you want with. The only people you are pretty much guaranteed to see everyday are your neighbors. Unless you enjoy the recurring head nod and wave of shame, leave your neighbors alone until they are no longer your neighbors. Another tip, develop a secret code with your roommates for when they should absolutely not come in. The sock-on-the-door-thing lost its subtlety before you were born, so don’t try to bring it back. A post-it on the door or a piece of tape over the lock will usually get the message across without advertising it to the whole floor. It can be tricky to get lucky in the dorms, but a little finesse and planning is all it takes.</p>\n<p>Dining Commons</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The single most important thing to know about the dining commons is that you can sit with anyone you know, even for just a little bit, so long as you are respectful of an ongoing conversation and aware that people sometimes need to sit alone. Pick up your yogurt and put it down next to anyone — perfect unassuming conversation starter for an easy 20 minutes of bonding. Even better, notice what your person of interest is eating and offer to take them to a restaurant that you “know” has the best whatever that thing is ever. Boom. Date one: Check. The rest is up to you.</p>\n<p>Welcome Week</p>\n<p>One of the most exciting times you’ll ever have. You’ll quickly find that you simultaneously know nobody and everybody. You’re a brand new person with a clean slate and this is the week to build your new reputation for the next four years of your life. This should excite you. You can be the Casanova, the Jock, the sweetheart, the lover, the shy one or the mysterious one. You can be anything, and the best part of it all — with so many new people to meet, you’ll have quite a few tries to get it right. Be confident. Everyone is as new as you. Relax, try new things, practice some old things and just be smart and safe when it comes down to it.</p>\n<p>Rec Center</p>\n<p>No matter what your body type is, the Rec Center can be a great friend to your love life if you know how to play the gym-going-game properly. Be restrained. The imagination is your friend when it comes to meeting a potential mate. Even if you have the picture-perfect body, don’t show it off too quickly. Half of the fun is finding out what’s underneath the shirt for the first time. Also, if you wear headphones, take them both out to talk to somebody. It shows you’re interested in more than looking. Lastly, don’t be afraid to introduce yourself to somebody, just make sure you don’t end up forcing yourself and your conversation on them when they’re trying to exercise. Read the signs — they’ll lead you home with a lovely companion.</p>\n<p>Class</p>\n<p>Both lecture and section are perfect places for making new acquaintances. If you sit by someone new, introduce yourself. That is, only if class has yet to start. Once the professor or TA starts speaking, stop talking. Don’t do it. You and your interest are both paying an insane amount of money per minute of class time, so take it seriously. An introduction before class and a quick conversation afterwards can lead a long way. Plus, referencing the lecture is an excellent icebreaker. “Can you believe there are over 300 species of squid in the world? On that note, let’s get weird.” Not a perfect example, but the principle is flawless. Use class as a place for brief introductions; leave the rest of the conversation for later.</p>\n<p>At the Beach</p>\n<p>This one is all about location: Choose where you lay out wisely. Stick near Santa Cruz if you’re looking for other freshmen, or venture down to Sands for some surfer eye candy. Bring something to spark conversation — a soccer ball, a volleyball or a six-pack … but you didn’t hear that from us … (seriously though, if you do this, do not go swimming. We don’t want your tickets or deaths on our hands). If you do get that cliché football landing on your towel, know that it was likely thrown on purpose, and have the confidence to throw it back and ask if you can join in. If you’re no Tom Brady, you could always ask him to show you how to properly finger those laces. And if you are the Tom Brady in this situation, pick a target and throw: It literally couldn’t be easier.</p>\n<p>In I.V.</p>\n<p>Honestly, this one may seem the most intimidating, but we can guarantee you that everyone is out there for the exact same reasons you are: To get drunk and meet people. Start conversations, and preferably get deeper than, “So what’s your major?” The key is to NOT be cliquey; it just makes you unapproachable (as does staring at your iPhone all night). You will have that one person that you stick to like glue, but think of them as more of a wingman than a hand-holder, and feed off of each other’s confidence rather than insecurities. If you need liquid courage, by all means, go for it. At least then you’ll have something to do with your hands. But don’t endlessly retreat to the keg just because it’s something to do rather than standing around awkwardly. If you drink to the point where you can’t take care of yourself, how do you expect to take care of that special someone else?</p>\n<p>At the Library</p>\n<p>Again, location is everything. It’s a big place, so try out a few different spots: You’ll get a feel for who sits where and then you can decide where you want to set up camp. Once you get your lib routine going, you’ll probably start seeing the same people, which is good. Then you can graduate to small talk. By no means am I telling you to interrupt someone’s studying, but if the opportunity arises, take it. Start with little things (“Hey, can you watch my laptop real quick?”) and keep your eyes and ears out for possible openings; maybe you’ll recognize a song that you can hear through their headphones, or they’ll be reading a book from a class that you’ve taken. Flirting at the library is definitely more of an art than these last two, but it can be done.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Opinion Co-Editors Emile Nelson and Allyson Campion would love to know if any of these tips actually work … Hit them up on Twitter @Nexus_Opinion.

June gloom slowly creeps up, with the calendar bitching at you to get your life together while your hands desperately shove tequila shots down your throat in an attempt to shut your brain off and slow the clock down for just a few more hours.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry. I feel you. When anyone utters the words “Week Nine” I look around for the nearest sledgehammer. And taking a GE Spring Quarter of my senior year turned into the worst mistake of my college career, as I unknowingly signed up for a twice-a-week freshman social hour, where the question Have you thought about what you’ll do after college? is about as threatening to them as How many different pairs of pants do you think Santa Claus has?</p>\n<p>Not only is the end of the year a rough time for those of us who inexplicably don’t have a summer job after having applied for … no jobs, but it’s a heartbreaker for the spring fling-ers and the “This is definitely going to last the summer”-ers. Spring Quarter is like a magical, sexy, boiling stew of beer bongs and pantless fun, but like all other things, it must end. And when it does, it stings like a slapshot to the tender cheek of the unassuming frat pledge.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Damn does it hurt.</p>\n<p>For those of you with that special someone … Nah, nevermind.</p>\n<p>More appropriately, for those of you engaged in a non-specific sexual relationship that feels like a never-ending game of Twister — leaving you a little sore and a lot confused — well, my friends, you’re in for the clusterfuck of your life.</p>\n<p>If you’re getting down with a graduating senior, get ready to have your shit rocked.</p>\n<p>When you’re lying in bed Sunday morning with the words “So, once you graduate, what are we … ?” hovering above your lips, please, quickly think of an alternate ending, because that question is like Hiroshima to any fourth-year male with dreams of continued sexual prowess beyond college. They want to believe that nothing will change — that there’s no sudden need for commitment because of this “adult” status that they never actually signed up for.</p>\n<p>Yes, it will always be panties-off party night in the bro mansion, tapping kegs and spitting game in the land of babes and excess. And in Seniorland, the no-strings-attached mentality is more amplified than ever.</p>\n<p>And really, who can blame them? Last year, both my best friend and I received the “I’m a graduating senior” excuse, which at the time sounded about as reasonable as “I fell on her mouth.” But with the sage, newfound wisdom of my Spring Quarter senior standing, I can tell you that it’s an attitude I’ve begun to adopt myself.</p>\n<p>This stage of life is like a two-and-a-half-month-long trade-off between a war cry and a cry of terror. At first, you arrive at the glowing steps of Spring Quarter, eyes narrowed in determination, scanning the horizon for fresh blood and sniffing the air for the scent of Prestige. The war cry is issued. Then Week Five comes around and you’re cradling your alcohol-destroyed body, sobbing over your planner and cursing yourself for the moment you decided to pencil in a countdown to graduation right next to that inspirational quote printed at the top corner of every page.</p>\n<p>It’s a feeling I know all too well, and just the motivation I needed to say “Fuck it. YOLO.”</p>\n<p>All in all, h-in’ up with someone on the precipice of the real world can be an awful lot of fun. They’re game for most anything … anywhere … and ready to share their wild absurdity (as well as their bed) with their fellow classmates. But it can also be a rough ride — yeah, in that way too — for the younger ones, not fully understanding the mentality of the person who’s currently in or around their mouth (or any orafice for that matter).</p>\n<p>My word of advice: Share, but beware. As I was once told, we’re “not trying to hurt any feelings,” we’re just seniors. So YOLO, and check a few off the bucket list or help someone else get one in before their glory days are over.</p>\n<p><em>Jana Barrett has spent the last four years getting hard and going hard.

Almost all of this legislation is really an attempt to disenfran- chise minorities and students. Wisconsin recently passed a Republican-backed law that prohibits students from voting on campus with their university IDs. Students are now required to present government-issued IDs with a valid address and expiration date. Florida’s new law requires participants in voter registration to register in advance with the state, a debilitating blow to college drives.</p>\n<p>If these measures don’t seem scary, then consider the legislation New Hampshire’s Republicans attempted to push through last year. HB 176 would have prevented stu- dents from voting in their college towns unless they resided there prior to matriculation. Imagine having to drive home for several hours and then back on a Tuesday in order to vote. One of the avid backers of this bill, Republican Assembly Speaker William O’Brien, said in a speech that his reasoning behind supporting such a bill had to do with the fact that students are “foolish,” vote “as a liberal” and “vote their feelings.” This is like saying that if someone does not vote for a Republican, then they are foolish, and therefore they should not vote, without actually saying it. The slew of such anti-student legislation proposals in an election year is only more evidence that the conservatives are scared — scared that young people will vote and that young people will not vote for them.</p>\n<p>I am not telling you whom to vote for. But I do suggest that before casting a ballot on June 5 you think long and hard about what sort of politician you want in office, which politician will fight for your rights, and which politician will try to turn California into New Hampshire or Florida.</p>\n<p><em>Alexandra Lototsky is a third-year political science and Slavic languages and literatures major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46942\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46942\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/conservatives-silence-young-voters-students-fear-growing-trend/","id":6012,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6011,6010,6009],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Respect Your Elders: Keep the Legacy Alive (Beneath the Sheets and Beyond)","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Alumni Weekend came as quickly as an undersexed 35-year-old with a full-time cubicle job as soon as he spots something fertile.

But the uniqueness of our explicit ventures here in this little town of wonderful misfits is that they prepare a wildness in us that will be fondly (and desperately) held onto — like that last saliva-diluted plastic handle at the party — for as long as our livers permit us to keep on keepin’ on.</p>\n<p>I.V. is a magical place. Yeah, I said it. And I’ll continue to say it till my UCSB sweatshirt has moth holes in it and “Loopy” better describes my mental state than my absurd, vodka-laden, bar-hopping Saturday afternoon with a bunch of lovable disasters I’m proud to call my best friends.</p>\n<p>This weekend reminded me of the damn awesome-as-shit spirit of you people — both beneath the sheets and, you know, in life. There’s something remarkable about seeing that guy who used to end up with a mop duct-taped to his torso every weekend return with a vengeance after three years out of college. And that old flame? Hell yeah, I hope you hit yours too, because there are few things so excellent as the realization of “Damn, that was worth all the emotional trauma it resulted in a couple years ago.”</p>\n<p>So, to the middle-aged troll at the Study Hall, to the alum I’ll never forget (at least until I get around to washing my bedsheets), to all of us who are still here, waking up Friday, Saturday and Sunday morning, questioning our character while we scour last night’s clothing for any telling stains: I salute you. And I will be the first to buy you a drink next year.</p>\n<p>Jana Barrett is the Daily Nexus Opinion Co-Editor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s May 2. Writing that fills me with a degree of nausea I’ve never before known in my life. I’ll find a job I love and keep in touch with the important people; that doesn’t worry me. I’m much more worried about my social habits. Isla Vista is a unique and magnificent place — but how well will that translate into the work world?</p>\n<p>I have a very distinct vision of how my work parties will unfold. My nightmare transpires like this: I’ve found a job I love and am slowly but surely proving to my colleagues that I’m cool, mostly with marginally offensive penis jokes. Thursday night rolls around and a co-workers innocently and fatally invites me to a happy hour gathering. I prepare to take it easy this first time, reminding myself that I’m actually much more fun to be around when my eyes aren’t crossed and I’m not slurring offensive “would you rather”s about railing your own father. We arrive at the bar, I order a beer, one thing leads to the next and BAM, I’m taking body shots off my boss. God forbid I’m ever in a professional setting with a wine bag … do adults drink Franzia?</p>\n<p>As Gauchos, we’ve spent four years perfecting a very specific skill set: making obliteration sexy. Perfecting may be a generous term, but we didn’t get into UCLA, and perfection is relative. Unfortunately, LinkedIn has yet to recognize blacked-out blowies as a legitimate professional attribute, so I guess we’ll just have to adjust. This isn’t anything to get discouraged about — instead, let’s view it as a challenge. There will come a day when you have to feel a bit guilty about boning down in a grimy bathroom, but why dwell on the future?</p>\n<p>Freshmen: You spent the last two quarters regressing from Smirnoff to Heritage, while struggling to balance three bullshit classes per quarter. Don’t worry if you haven’t figured out how to incorporate sloshed sex yet — that’s what sophomore year is for.</p>\n<p>Sophomores: If you’re on track, slutty is no longer a label but a lifestyle. Well done.</p>\n<p>Juniors: At some point this past year, you felt directionless. You entered into a losing philosophical debate with yourself about the purpose of drinking so much and struggled to see your self-worth. Well snap out of it; you’re a Gaucho, goddammit.</p>\n<p>Seniors: You’ve come to terms with the fact that you no longer deserve your parents’ love and are panicking imagining a world of courtship and consequences. To you I suggest going out with a bang — bone down in the library, Bill’s bus, OTT’s bathroom and your roommate’s bed ASAP. There’s something to be said for packing it in at the end. You know, taking some for the road.</p>\n<p>In reality, we’re going to take a lot away with us from UCSB — a degree, a wealth of knowledge and an outlook on seizing the moment that dangerously flirts with alcoholism. I talk big about conforming to professional standards, but let’s be real: It’s going to take years to undo our undergrad damage. And if that’s going to make me a ho in the workplace, then so be it.</p>\n<p>Jenna Ryan is the Daily Nexus Opinion Co-Editor.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Natalie O” align=”aligncenter” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1332400935\" data-slb-group=\"46564\"><img data-attachment-id=\"46565\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/screen-shot-2012-05-01-at-9-38-59-pm-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?fit=1219%2C694&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1219,694\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2012-05-01 at 9.38.59 PM (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?fit=250%2C142&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?fit=888%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-46565\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-05-01 at 9.38.59 PM (1)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1-250x142.png?resize=250%2C142\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"142\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?resize=250%2C142&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?resize=1024%2C583&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?w=1219&amp;ssl=1 1219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46564\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46564\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/","id":6394,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6393,6392,6391],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Where to Turn When BROing and HOing Have Lost Their Appeal","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Most unfortunately, in order to speak of this next topic, I will have to address something fetid and repulsive.

I’m going to talk about an aspect of intercourse that is often lost, forgotten, feared, denied and even despised.

Feelings go against my every instinct as a scientist. But as a scientist, I am familiar with the idea that sometimes paradigm shifts are the key to progress. Occasionally, you must go against your instincts and follow the math. So let us begin our analysis.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Isla Vista provides an interesting experimental environment where a large amount of various intoxicants are used to decouple action and rationale. Much of the sex that occurs in Isla Vista occurs in the absence of actual emotional attachment or, indeed, actual knowledge of a person’s name, and I am the first to admit that I am very guilty of indulging such simple solutions to the wayward desire. Intrinsically, there is nothing wrong with this — it is a natural desire to have sex and, if one is cautious, one is perfectly entitled to have as much consensual sex as they wish and forget every other variable. But entitlement never won over a Nobel committee, so let’s look at the other side and glance at the possible reasons behind the model.</p>\n<p>Most people raised in American culture are familiar with the cultural ideals put forth to young children. A young, sexy woman is swept off her feet by some amazing stallion of a man, and they live happily ever after. As an organism grows within the culture, the ideal will change somewhat — occasionally even so far as it is the man being swept up by some creative, quirky, perfect woman — but ultimately the end result is the same: you find someone faultless, you are happy, it is forever. And ever. And ever.</p>\n<p>My regular readers will immediately spot a flaw in this ideal. The Posit of Gender/Sex Dissociation, among an uncountable number of other psychological factors, impedes this ideal’s overarching plausibility. Somewhat fortunately, our parents’ generation took the brunt of that particular psychological mutilation and is attempting to sew together their pitiable, overly idealized psyches with an astonishingly high divorce rate and one-in-five emotional disorder statistics. But our generation felt the effect, because to counter this idea of eternal love, we formulated what I shall now coin as the Boozing, Rolling, Opiating and Humping then Omitting method, or BRO and HO* method. The process of drugging up, having sex and forgetting the consequences can be drawn as a parallel to the teenage sexual liberation in the 1950s in response to the Stepford-Wives style conservatism that dominated that era. And indulging in the typical BRO and HO* night is objectively quite pleasurable, but why is it becoming the norm?</p>\n<p>It is stereotypical, but admittedly statistically verifiable, to consider gays a relatively promiscuous people. This tendency can be easily derived from cultural axioms, and I would happily do so if I didn’t have a word limit. But ultimately when I wake up in the morning, and roll over to find whoever I managed to bring home last night, my thought usually isn’t “Damn, my life is awesome.” It’s “Water … please, God … water!” and then “Could I date this person?” The answer is typically no. If it weren’t for the BRO and HO* method, I would never have survived conversation with this person for longer than five minutes. And when I realize just how fantastically boring I find them, I have to use the same brainpower I spent figuring out how to get home with them to undoing their sudden and bizarre desire to sleep in my bed as long as humanly possible.</p>\n<p>My studies indicate I am not alone in this experience. The BRO and HO* culture has permeated every gender, every sex and every sexual orientation I’ve observed. And this is bad. Sex is fun, natural and a great way to blow off steam, but the fact it’s now largely assumed to be a commodity — “Dude, I so hope I get laid tonight” — is irredeemably unsettling to me. There is a fine line between sexual empowerment and forgetting the most exquisite parts of sex — a physical manifestation of the deepest sort of bond. I am not saying stop your BROing and HOing, I’m just asking you why you’re doing it. Is it fear of commitment, with which obsession spawned for our parents an unmatched era of over-committing and divorce? Or are you actually without any desire to have something meaningful? Or do you, and this is the opinion I would hope all possess, merely view this casual sex as transitive and honestly desire emotionally valuable sex in the future?</p>\n<p>The phrasing of this last statement is essential. I am not promoting, denouncing or forming any opinion on monogamy. Emotional sex is not created by putting a ring on it (someone’s finger not … you get it), but formed through an actual, non-ethanol based chemistry between two humans. I once hooked up with a guy and, to this day, consider the sex we had to have been in every way fulfilling, due to his energy and passion and, for lack of a better word, sheer attractiveness. Attraction is maximized in emotional sex — whether it happens one Saturday at four in the morning or every Friday night after you go out on a fun double date with the neighbors just to spice things up.</p>\n<p>I guess what I’m saying, readers, is I have a new ideal to supersede the pretty princess and her Prince Charming. Emotion and sex are intrinsically tied, and we all deserve to have both satiated. By whatever mechanism, find that for yourself. Identify that person you’ve been after since September of freshman year, break out some drinks and when the light reflects from her eyes in just the right way, or he smirks and shows off his perfect bone structure for the ninth time, then fucking go for it. If you’re rejected, you have BRO and HO to fall back on.</p>\n<p>I’ve been dancing around the word love this entire article, but now here’s my challenge to you before I speak again in two weeks: go find some love. For the duration of 15 minutes or until you die, give your heart as much as a role as your genitals in the sex. Just try it out, because I hear it’s some kinky shit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*The term “BRO and HO” is not meant to be misogynistic, but rather is a satirical use of two terms that most, if not all, UCSB students should be familiar with. If you were offended as a woman I sincerely apologize. If you were offended as a man then I am mildly curious to meet you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1695187794\" data-slb-group=\"46378\"><img data-attachment-id=\"46379\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/fuckingcuddling-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?fit=1500%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"FUCKINGcuddling (1)\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;“No, We’re Not Having Sex, We’re Just Cuddling So Fucking Hard That His Dick Is Inside Me, In Case My Roommate Walks Into the Living Room for Water”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?fit=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?fit=888%2C568&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-46379\" title=\"FUCKINGcuddling (1)\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1-250x160.jpg?resize=250%2C160\" width=\"250\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?resize=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C655&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FUCKINGcuddling-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46378\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46378\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-25/turn-broing-hoing-lost-appeal/","id":6396,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6395,6394,6393],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/384"}},"__N_SSG":true}
