Surfrider Foundation, along with the nonprofit ReRip, will place bins on DP to collect and repurpose broken surfboards, wetsuits and other gear.<em> Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Surfrider Foundation will launch a coordinated project with nonprofit organization ReRip next quarter to collect and repurpose broken or unwanted surf equipment.</p>\n<p>The foundation intends to place a collection bin along the beachside intersections of Del Playa Drive for recycling all forms of damaged or used surf equipment.</p>\n<p>“The collection bin will be a physical emblem of Isla Vista sustainability efforts,” said Benny Drescher, an intern for I.V. Surfrider.</p>\n<p>The broken longboards, wetsuits and other surf gear will be distributed to artists and ReRip for repairs, and Drescher said ReRip will also use the materials to teach disadvantaged youth how to surf.</p>\n<p>According to ReRip’s website, the company salvages and reuses “everything from fins and broken bits to complete boards.” The company repairs “rideable boards” to be surfed again; some boards are resold and many are given away to schools, nonprofits and people in need.</p>\n<p>While the closest collection site to donate used surf materials is currently located in Ventura, the new collection bin initiative hopes to offer a more “accessible and convenient” means for student surfers to repurpose their trash.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) is still discussing procedures for maintaining the bins and managing their capacity.</p>\n<p>“The project needs stewardship,” said Dave Hubbard, director of the IVRPD, noting the tendency of “loose objects on Del Playa to get thrown off the cliff into the ocean.”</p>\n<p>At their board meeting on Nov. 10, the IVRPD Board of Directors voiced potential concerns about the project’s implementation, including the possibility of Isla Vista party-goers “pulling donations out and throwing them around the park,” or “setting the bin on fire.”</p>\n<p>“If the problem appears to be a reality, we can add a lock to the bins or erect a fence that will surround the bins,” said Surfrider organizers in their proposal. “Surfrider officers will frequently check the bins to organize materials and report to ReRip when a donation pickup is needed.”</p>\n<p>Together, I.V.

IVCRC additionally reached out to local restaurants to cater to the event, such as Ike’s Place, Silvergreens and Blaze Pizza, altogether expanding the tasty range of amenities the carnival had to offer.</p>\n<p>Spudnuts Donuts drew in crowds with free donut bites, green tea boba and coupons for their next visit, nestled among the herds of passing students.</p>\n<p>“The main goal of the event is to start off the year with all of the community united,” said Jennifer Kim, external chair of IVCRC. “It isn’t closed off just to UCSB students; we aim for the families in the community to come out and enjoy the fun as well!”</p>\n<p>Organizations outside of USCB took advantage of this opportunity, inviting students to get to know the resources available to them beyond the campus in the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>Acacia Counseling and Wellness, for example, had a colorful board of post-its near the ferris wheel that carnival goers could add to. Students circled the board to write words of encouragement to share with their fellow peers, putting them on display to pass on to the next person in need of a positive pick-me-up.</p>\n<p>Ruby Aranki, a fourth year student and administrative manager of the organization, said the purpose of the activity is not only to “destigmatize the current notion of mental health but also raise awareness of the current outlets available to serve those who suffer with depression or anxiety disorders.” With their upcoming $1 yoga sessions available to all members of the Isla Vista community, Acacia plans to put all proceeds towards a student therapy fund for those unable to afford the cost of counseling.</p>\n<p>When asked about her impression of the I.V. community thus far, first-year student Emily Hong noted that she loved how the community is so tight-knit and welcoming and the fun extends “beyond the frathouse.”</p>\n<p>“It kind of reminds students that I.V. isn’t all about the party reputation you expect coming into it, and it’s completely avoidable if it’s not your thing,” Hong said. “In my opinion I thought the carnival was a great way to kick off the new year, and with all the food and carnival games there was something fun for everyone to enjoy.”</p>\n<p>Kim rested easy at the end of the event she helped organize, noting that although it got hectic behind the scenes, the shortfalls meant nothing compared to the success of the event as a whole.</p>\n<p>“Seeing how it all came together the day of and all the happy faces of people coming to the stands, it really made the hard work pay off,” Kim said.</p>\n<p><em>See more at <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-10-01/in-photos-pardall-carnival-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">In Photos: Pardall Carnival 2016</a></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72779\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72779\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/","id":4625,"author":{"id":104,"name":"Aly Giammanco"},"related":[4624,4623,4622],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/104"}},"__N_SSG":true}
